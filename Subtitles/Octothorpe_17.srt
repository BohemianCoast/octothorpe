1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
 I'm going to use that as the transition between the segments this week Alison.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,400
 I'm going to put a little note at the beginning saying Alison Burpt and I decided to embrace

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,800
 that as a motif and instead of having our theme song, I've perved into the microphone.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,080
 I don't know what I was thinking.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
 You really did.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,920
 I saw you move to the microphone to really get it on in the track.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,520
 You know how there's normally a beep at the end?

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,920
 Not beep anymore.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
 Yes.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
 Excellent.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,920
 Excellent.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
 Okay.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:56,200
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 17th episode of the OctaThought podcast, a podcast

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,400
 for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,560
 This is the episode for the 29th of October 2020.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
 I am John Coxon.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,520
 I am Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,360
 And today we are brought to you by two excellent letters of comment.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 The first one comes from Dave Mansfield, who says that he found it really amusing hearing

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,240
 the shift from reviewing online conventions to worrying the wrong format was getting to

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,520
 be tradition to it being clear with hindsight that we were going to run one and then episode

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,120
 15 running with that as an accidental gag of failing to announce it was perfect.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
 So thank you, Dave.

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 We would like to say that was all entirely on purpose and not just happenstance through

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,040
 a number of episodes we recorded.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,080
 I'm glad that we're coming up with themes and stuff.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
 That's nice.

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,800
 Join our before we forget to mention it.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,200
 Join our convention punctuation punctuationcon.uk.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,320
 If you are on that page and you are logged in, you will see the link to our Discord where

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,160
 you can come and talk to people.

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,120
 And a few days after you join, John will send you an email with the link to our Discord

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,080
 as well, just in case you missed the one on the page.

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
 But it will be a good time.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
 Come and join.

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
 Yay.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
 Good blogging.

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,800
 Since last time we completely forgot.

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 Plug early, plug often.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,320
 Yeah, it does feel like for those people who are listening to us, we have spent quite a

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,400
 lot of time talking about online conventions and will spend yet more time talking about

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,960
 online conventions this week.

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,440
 So now we really have to do it and not make a complete hash of it.

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
 Yeah.

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,160
 I mean, that was already, I think that was already the plan.

46
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,280
 Like we hadn't decided secretly to just like massively sack in.

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,440
 But yeah, now it's getting a bit real now because it is.

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
 Hang on, I'm going to check the widget on my phone.

49
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,800
 It's 19 days and six hours until punctuation.

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,280
 At the time of recording, by the time you hear this listeners, it will be less than that

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,920
 because that's how time works.

52
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,680
 I'm now worried because it's not very long.

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,200
 Don't put that in the podcast.

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,760
 That's absolutely going to get the podcast list.

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
 No.

56
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
 100%.

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,480
 It'll be fine.

58
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,760
 We just need to sort out the program.

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,240
 If you want to do a program item for us, please let us know.

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,400
 You can volunteer in the discord.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
 Yes.

62
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
 If you remember.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,080
 So join first, then go to the discord, then send us your program ideas or you could email

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,560
 us with your program ideas.

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
 Yes.

66
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,120
 Or use smoke signals as long as we can see them in Wolfenstoe, Bangkok and Southampton.

67
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
 So it has to be pretty.

68
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
 Yeah, please don't do that.

69
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,720
 Don't do whatever it would take to generate that.

70
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 Yeah.

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,000
 If you cause a global eruption in order to signal a program item, we will treat that

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,880
 as a code of conduct violation and we will eject you from our online convention.

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,360
 From the smoking pit where our online convention used to be.

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,520
 I need to just edit the code of conduct to strongly discourage deliberate volcanic eruptions.

75
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,920
 Dave also says if Zoom is methadone for consocial spaces and discord is paracetamol, is Octa

76
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,200
 thought one of those double blind trials where it turns out the placebo is better than the

77
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,880
 current version?

78
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,760
 And I think that's a compliment.

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
 Liz explain it to us because it's a biology joke.

80
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,400
 I want to say that we should definitely not disallow accidental volcanic eruptions because

81
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
 then where would Rob Hanson be?

82
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,200
 That's an old, old, old, but nevertheless very finished joke.

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 Yes.

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,040
 So, um, I don't understand.

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,640
 Listen's joke and I don't understand Dave's joke.

86
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,080
 That's the Liz verdict.

87
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,040
 We've got two joke checker Liz.

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,720
 She's come back.

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,360
 I mean, are we the placebo?

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,840
 I don't get it.

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,320
 I think I don't know.

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 I don't know.

93
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,680
 Claire Briley, we'd be able to sleep if we didn't actually run the convention but just

94
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,720
 talked about all the lectures for a weekend.

95
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,720
 Claire Briley of Croydon will understand the reference to Rob Hanson and volcanic eruption.

96
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,600
 And we will also put a link to the explanation of that joke in the show notes.

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,960
 So on this subject of Dave Mansfield's lock, I want to do some follow out Alison hat tip

98
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,320
 to the upgrade podcast for the name.

99
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,360
 But basically this never happens.

100
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,760
 Discussed online convention mechanisms on their podcast and Dave has written to us about

101
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,960
 Zoom and Discord and Octa though.

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,440
 And I do just want to say they point out that Zoom and Discord are not as good as real

103
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
 conventions.

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,200
 And I just want to highlight I very much strongly agree with that sentiment.

105
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,720
 But as someone who hasn't been to a proper convention 18 months and won't go to another

106
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,560
 one for another 18 months, I am sort of trying to manage this three year stretch of loneliness

107
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,320
 and isolation with some level of online interactivity.

108
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,400
 And so we are trying our best in a difficult and trying time.

109
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,360
 So yes, but I'm not in any way of the impression that any of this stuff is as good as a proper

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
 convention.

111
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,560
 And I very much look forward to the point of which they happen again because I miss them

112
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,200
 very, very dearly.

113
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,640
 So I take a point and also I do want to hear what is your plan for the convention you're

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,920
 going to go to in 18 months.

115
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,320
 But I can see that if everyone's be saying, oh, you can get on Discord and talk to fans

116
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,880
 and do Zoom's and you get on Discord and it is basically I see, but I can use more emoji

117
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
 than.

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
 And gifts.

119
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
 Don't forget those gifts.

120
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,120
 Yeah, it's not exactly like, it's not exactly what we were promised at the turn of the 20th

121
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
 century, I think.

122
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,440
 Yes, I want the matrix.

123
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,960
 And it hasn't come yet.

124
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,320
 And second life isn't it.

125
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,520
 So if anyone writes in, boo.

126
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,760
 I want a virtual world in which my neck doesn't hurt, which is a little bit of fun.

127
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,160
 Alison's neck hurts and we will get to that in staying injured in the apocalypse.

128
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,040
 In the things not to do with your new toys.

129
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,240
 Oh man, that's going to really set up.

130
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,640
 Like people could be like, what on earth has she done?

131
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,920
 Okay, so Claire Briarley of Croydon writes to us and says things which are very nice.

132
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,880
 I picked out a highlight as I like to do with Claire's letters and my highlight is that she

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,000
 says the Discord chat has already made me feel quite fanish, I interested and engaged

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,600
 and amused and occasionally irritated.

135
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,400
 And that seems like a good thing.

136
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,760
 I am happy that it is engendered all of those emotions that I think means it might be working

137
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,520
 in some way.

138
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,240
 So hoorah.

139
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,720
 And yes, it was a very lovely letter.

140
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,000
 Thank you, Claire.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,920
 My highlight from Claire's letter is how in Stainche's prior attempts to baffle the

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,720
 whole game of by sending him a corner of a completed jigsaw puzzle.

143
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,240
 She's right.

144
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,760
 That is the conclusion we came to and we should continue with that.

145
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,040
 I think, I mean, I don't think he would be baffled.

146
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,000
 I think he would be flat.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,720
 Neil, if you're listening, do write in.

148
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
 No explanation.

149
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,960
 I'm sending a corner of a random completed jigsaw puzzle.

150
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,440
 Okay.

151
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,880
 And yes, Alison, any highlights from Claire's letter?

152
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:35,240
 Those two, but also she does mention the possibility of sending Neil Gaiman "Weterbix",

153
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,240
 which reminds me that we have had the fourth installment of Claire's series of short fan

154
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,040
 scenes about "Weterbix", which means that it is that manageable for Hugo.

155
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,960
 So, you know, if you're thinking about your Hugo nominations for 2021, yeah.

156
00:08:50,960 --> 00:09:00,640
 If you can nominate things for 2021, I strongly, strongly advise that you nominate Claire's

157
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,760
 "Weterbix-based" fan scene, which is called "Weekend Weeterbix".

158
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,160
 It is eligible for a Hugo award.

159
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,520
 I think it should win.

160
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,600
 It's better that the fans that you know I'm usually nominated for.

161
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,560
 And so, yeah, please go forth and nominate.

162
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,200
 And also, it'd be really funny if Claire won for "Weekend Weeterbix" and not "Bonardo

163
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 Wigs".

164
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,680
 Oh, come on, you can find that funny.

165
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
 But there we go.

166
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,960
 I'm a bad human being.

167
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
 Yes.

168
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,880
 One of my favourite moments in all of fandom was when I got to give Claire a Hugo award.

169
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,920
 That was a 10-out-10 time in my life.

170
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,200
 One of my favourite moments in fandom was when I got up one morning to discover that Claire

171
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,200
 had sent me a "Weterbix" by a large letter post lovingly encased in a box made out of

172
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
 Lego.

173
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,960
 And I found out in the most recent edition of "Weekend Weerbix" that my wife and I

174
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,280
 have won a prize and we don't know what the prize is.

175
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
 So, that's very exciting.

176
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
 Have you?

177
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,080
 What have you won a prize for?

178
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,560
 You don't know.

179
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,400
 Sending sending the smallest "Weterbix" to Claire or sending a "Weterbix" in the smallest

180
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,080
 amount of packaging, I suppose.

181
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,640
 We didn't like sending mini "Weterbix".

182
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
 I was going to say...

183
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:25,360
 I was going to cover all the podcasts because I've just had an unrelated idea.

184
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,680
 I think I'm going to cut that out of the podcast because I've just had an idea.

185
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,840
 It's a good title for the podcast.

186
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:44,000
 Yeah, though, I have to stay in, mightn't it?

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,440
 Liz went to the "Fire Fringe".

188
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,760
 So "Fire" is a magazine, the name of which is easy to pronounce unless you're an old

189
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,960
 white guy.

190
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,920
 And they ran a convention since the last time we recorded.

191
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
 And Liz went.

192
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,400
 So Liz, tell us about that.

193
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
 I did.

194
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,640
 I should probably explain what the "Firecon Fringe" was.

195
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,040
 So "Firecon" ran over two days and mostly in, I think, the US Eastern time zone.

196
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,800
 And they also had limited memberships.

197
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,640
 I mean, they had quite a lot of members, but they didn't have unlimited memberships.

198
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,520
 So I decided not to buy a membership because it would be a terrible time zone for me and

199
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,440
 I would just be taking up a seat.

200
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,360
 Someone else could otherwise be occupying in a more productive way.

201
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,560
 So they also put on the "Firecon Fringe", which essentially on the day before the convention,

202
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,520
 the organiser of the "Firecon Fringe", I believe, are Vida Cruz and Iori Kusano.

203
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,680
 Basically put on " Fringe" programming so that people who were in time zones where it

204
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,760
 would be quite awkward for them to watch a lot of the main convention programming would

205
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,520
 get to feel involved.

206
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,160
 And they very kindly made this all available for free.

207
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,000
 You just had to register.

208
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,440
 So I attended several items on the "Firecon Fringe" and it was all very nice.

209
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
 It started for me at 7am.

210
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,240
 So I did miss the first couple of hours.

211
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,280
 But it ran from 7am to 7pm in my time zone, which was great.

212
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
 What did I watch panels on?

213
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,920
 I watched a panel on running a genre magazine.

214
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,640
 I watched a tough panel on finding and getting involved in your local science fiction scene.

215
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,240
 I watched a really good one called "Different But the Same", writing from the diaspora

216
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,160
 versus writing locally where they had essentially a bunch of authors who were all either from

217
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,040
 the diaspora or not, but had very different perspectives on how it worked for them personally

218
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,840
 being diaspora authors or non-diaspora authors.

219
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,480
 The benefits of being seen as one or the other and the way there's benefits of being seen

220
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,000
 and one or the other was different depending which diaspora you were in.

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,360
 And it was a really interesting panel that could only be done really by having a very

222
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,680
 diverse and interesting set of authors who all came from a slightly different angle on

223
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
 this.

224
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,280
 So I was just wondering how I finished out by watching one called "Destroy All Emperors",

225
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,480
 the post-colonial and anti-colonial insight fiction of fantasy.

226
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,840
 And then I listened to part of "We Won't Phone It In" for an Anglophone audience, which was,

227
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,640
 yeah, about how you write and thinking about your audience and thinking about where your

228
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,760
 book is going to be sold and marketed and where the translation is going to go.

229
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,920
 And also the difficulties of writing works where just because of commercial necessity,

230
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,080
 you need to be often trying to sell them if you're writing an English to a US or UK publisher

231
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,760
 and how what they see as what will be marketable and palatable to an Anglophone audience is

232
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,760
 not necessarily the same as what the audience actually would like to see, they feel.

233
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,080
 And it was also very interesting because they even discussed like what is the definition

234
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,240
 of an Anglophone audience.

235
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,800
 It's not everyone whose native language is English, it's not everyone who can read books

236
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,240
 in English, it is kind of different depending on whether you're from a country which is

237
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,720
 part of this dominant marketplace.

238
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,800
 So basically they were all really interesting.

239
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,560
 I say I listen to part of them because I did unfortunately have a few issues with my internet.

240
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,440
 It didn't seem to particularly like streaming from their streaming service, but I think

241
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,640
 that was my internet because no one else seemed to have problems.

242
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,720
 And it was just inviting a bunch of really interesting people into your living room to

243
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
 talk on an interesting subject for an hour.

244
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,760
 And I very much enjoyed it.

245
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,360
 And then I understand the rest of it was also really interesting if you're a full member,

246
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,560
 you could join their Discord as well and talk to people that way.

247
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
 Nice.

248
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,960
 That sounds really, really cool.

249
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,520
 I will say it was also an example of like for me because I wasn't on the Discord, it literally

250
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,000
 was just a set of panels which were the panelists on Zoom and they were streamed by a streaming

251
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,640
 service they used because you had to register.

252
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,440
 And I was just sort of watching them or listening to them like a podcast at certain times.

253
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,000
 And it did completely hold my attention.

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,160
 So maybe you don't always need to have the social side of things in there.

255
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,680
 Sometimes it is enough to just have great content and put it out there and there's an

256
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
 audience for that.

257
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:10,520
 Yeah, I think that obviously varies from like committed to question and from many to venue.

258
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,240
 I missed a panel yesterday.

259
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,600
 This is a bit of a digression, but it's on translation.

260
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:25,000
 So I think it is relevant to what you were saying where the essence of Wonder people run

261
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,560
 a weekend by weekend track of SF panels.

262
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:40,000
 They are in the afternoon in Eastern time, US time, which is a little bit of a shame because

263
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,880
 a lot of content is in that time zone.

264
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:51,440
 But the one yesterday was on a conversation about SF and F in translation and they had

265
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,520
 four different translators who presented interpretations of the same passage and discussed

266
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,280
 like the differences between the choices they had made, which sounded really interesting.

267
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,200
 And I was very sad to miss it.

268
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,240
 But I will put a link in the show notes for anyone who's interested in signing up to that

269
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,360
 kind of chain of panels.

270
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,640
 I was in a panel at WELCOME with the nominees with the finalists for the LoadStar award.

271
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,520
 #NotAHUGAR.

272
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:25,120
 And they were talking about the that issue about the publishers expectations for the

273
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,080
 audience being very different from what your audience actually wants with regard to young

274
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,160
 adult novels, where I think it is also very relevant.

275
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,560
 So did you find Liz that you felt that you were missing out from not being on the Discord

276
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,840
 or did it kind of not really feel like there was anything that you hadn't been able to

277
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,320
 interact with?

278
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,240
 I did feel I was missing out because I saw a number of people on Twitter saying how good

279
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,040
 and how kind of welcoming and also the Discord was.

280
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,520
 But I think it's also worth pointing out that, you know, Firecom was very much aimed at BIPOC

281
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,760
 participants.

282
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,840
 And so it wasn't really aimed at me anyway, so it's possible that what I would have got

283
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,840
 out of the Discord would be different from what other people got out of the Discord.

284
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,640
 I'm sure I would have still had a really good time on it, but I wasn't looking to make

285
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,120
 those connections with other writers from other communities.

286
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,480
 But one other thing I want to say is that Firecom also, I think, had live captioning for

287
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,040
 all their panels, including all the Fringe panels.

288
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,280
 And that worked really well.

289
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
 Cool.

290
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:38,000
 But have gone to Firecom if they had had memberships and had not been full, because I felt that

291
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,320
 it would have been an opportunity for me to essentially absorb a lot of other people's

292
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:51,840
 experiences in quite a good way without having to be a participant or make any of that happen.

293
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,960
 I could have just kind of listened to what people had to say.

294
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,960
 But I couldn't do the Friday night for some other reason.

295
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,800
 Although, although I never go anywhere and never do anything, my life appears to be incredibly

296
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,160
 full all the time, which I find very strange.

297
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,800
 I don't understand what's happened.

298
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,480
 My final thought about Firecom is actually it worked.

299
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,080
 Maybe it worked for me as something which I listened to rather than interacted with,

300
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,720
 because really it was a convention designed for me personally to be listening to and learning

301
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 from, but maybe not interacting and putting out my voice in there, because that's not

302
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
 really what it was for.

303
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,000
 That was kind of what I wanted to say.

304
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,920
 My brain is not working properly.

305
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,360
 I think I basically nicked what I listened to and then faced it in a different way.

306
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
 So, teamwork.

307
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
 Yeah, teamwork.

308
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:45,440
 No, and I think I think obviously the value of being an ally is good, because you can

309
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,440
 lend your voice and weight to allyship.

310
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,400
 But often it's more important to be a good listener and not to use your voice instead

311
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,120
 of listening to black, indigenous people of colour voices.

312
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:10,520
 And so, yes, I think that is probably a good point.

313
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:20,840
 I did go to a convention, which was not Firecom, but I went to a convention last weekend, which

314
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:28,600
 was IneffableCon, which was a virtual convention focused around Good Omen's fandom.

315
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,360
 So Rachel Livermore and Bethany Windsor were the co-chairs, and I think they hit about

316
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,800
 600 attendees virtually.

317
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:43,640
 I didn't take part much in the social spaces because I was doing a few tabletop game related

318
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,080
 events that weekend.

319
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,440
 But I did see some of the programming.

320
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,320
 They did Pointless, which was awesome, very well done.

321
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,440
 And people seem to be having a really good time.

322
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,600
 So, fandom, I have not been to conventions where the primary thrust of the fan stream

323
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,560
 is centered around fan fiction and fan works in quite the same way that that convention

324
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,080
 had a strong emphasis on that.

325
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,920
 So it was really interesting to see that side of fandom.

326
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,640
 So, yeah, that was really good.

327
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:24,640
 I will say Rachel has posted a Twitter thread about the platform they used, in which she

328
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,360
 kind of outlies some of the benefits and drawbacks.

329
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,320
 And we will post a link to that in the show notes because it was very good and very thoughtful

330
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,800
 thread.

331
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:41,080
 I was particularly struck with one of her tweets in that thread, which was that they

332
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,960
 designed their social spaces by doing exactly what I was planning to for punctuation, which

333
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,920
 is to have a giant zoom with a load of breakout spaces for lots of different things.

334
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,720
 You could go somewhere in it, you could go somewhere in chill, you could go somewhere

335
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,160
 and discuss all sorts of things and you could have meat, spontaneous meat ups and that sort

336
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,360
 of thing.

337
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,120
 And she said, that's great.

338
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,720
 And I was like, well, that is exactly what we were hoping to do.

339
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,720
 So that was very exciting to me.

340
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,960
 And then she went and said, of course, you have to get everyone on zoom 5.3.

341
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,800
 And I was like, yeah, well, that is the story of my life for October has been telling every

342
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,160
 single person I know individually how to upgrade to zoom 5.3.

343
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:37,760
 So I think I'm going to do it again here and say, do upgrade to zoom 5.3 by going to www.zoom.us/dact.

344
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,160
 Download, we will put the link in the show notes.

345
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,920
 Actually, no, do upgrade to zoom 5.3.

346
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,480
 We will put the link in the show notes before coming to punctuation or other cons that are

347
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,880
 using zoom because your experience will be much improved.

348
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,080
 So as I say, I went to an F double.

349
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
 I had a good time.

350
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,440
 I'm kind of on the periphery of both the technical solutions used to implement the convention

351
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,960
 and also the fandom.

352
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,520
 So I kind of feel like I don't have much more to say this inside falls.

353
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,000
 [MUSIC]

354
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Liz put a link in our show notes to an article on using game design to make virtual events

355
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,240
 more social.

356
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,680
 So Liz, do you want to give us a quick pre-see of this article and kind of why it's interesting?

357
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:33,680
 Yeah, so it was just a conference called Roguelike Celebration, which is a game design conference.

358
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,320
 And rather than just using discord or Slack or zoom or whatever, they actually built themselves

359
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,440
 a mod to run the convention.

360
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,840
 So when you log in, you're placed into, do I need to explain mod?

361
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
 I had to look it up.

362
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,040
 Oh my god, oh my god.

363
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,680
 I remember using what when I was a kid, but I think I only used the flight for five minutes

364
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,440
 and they were not really a thing when I was at school or at uni.

365
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
 Oh god.

366
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,720
 They weren't really a thing when I was at school either, John.

367
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,320
 Well, yeah, but you guys had I because it's right.

368
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,560
 You made your own fun.

369
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
 Okay.

370
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,880
 So there was a period between when I went to school and when John went to school, when

371
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,160
 the mod or multi-user dungeon was the state of the art.

372
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,640
 And it is in fact a text based, a multi-room text based adventure game that you manage

373
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,960
 for yourself.

374
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,720
 So wander around.

375
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,880
 Yeah, I will then I return you to Liz.

376
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,160
 Yes, so they basically decided that since this was something that their attendees would

377
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,120
 probably be quite into, they would run it.

378
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,960
 Essentially, they have something sort of a bit like a discord or an ILC, except you're

379
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,040
 actually navigating around this little ASCII art map.

380
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,960
 And when you go to different rooms, you're in a slightly different channel.

381
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,120
 And if you want to watch the talk, then you go into the theatre and you can see their

382
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,080
 talk being streamed there and chat underneath it.

383
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,680
 But they kind of added into it kind of lots of little Easter eggs.

384
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,960
 So you know, there was a swag table and you could take swag and then you could see everyone

385
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,320
 else who was there and they'd be holding a piece of the, you know, virtual swag.

386
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,240
 And like that, you think you could you could randomly drink potions that would put an emoji

387
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,080
 in front of your name and things like that.

388
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,120
 I'm at the bar at the bar and it just made everything it kind of gave people things to

389
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,040
 play with things to chat about playing with because you could see all these other people

390
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,040
 have little emoji in front of your name and ask them, well, how do you get the emoji?

391
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,960
 And they could point you to the potion and things like that.

392
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,520
 Just to add a bit of fun to it.

393
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,480
 And also having the different rooms allowed them to divide things between, okay, you can

394
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,600
 go into the theatre or whatever and talk to lots and lots of people.

395
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,520
 Or you go into one of the smaller side rooms and talk to a few people.

396
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,080
 So the kind of thing you try and do with a big Zoom channel versus breakout rooms, except

397
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,640
 you do it by, you know, clicking around on a map and ending up in the different rooms

398
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,000
 they have, you know, and if you look at their map, they have like, you know, they have a

399
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,360
 theatre and they have a bar and things like that.

400
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,600
 But they also had a haunted foyer and the astral plane.

401
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
 Okay.

402
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,640
 At this point, I'd like to say there used to be a Spanish mod called Elle de Mu, which

403
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,200
 I suspect quite a few of Alice in us will remember.

404
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,920
 And this is a thing that I can, it was run by Lucy Hunt Singer.

405
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,120
 This is a thing that I can date almost precisely because I know that I was in Elle de Mu in

406
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,080
 August 1997 because when Diana died, Alan Harris and I were in a room in Elle de Mu

407
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,600
 swapping, you know, all those die dies, dody deaders, dodo type jokes.

408
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,520
 And Lucy became very quiet and it turned out that she was genuinely upset at the death

409
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,960
 of Diana Princess of Wales and none of the British fans could understand how this was

410
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,240
 such a thing was possible.

411
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,280
 So, and that demonstrated again that text based chat is not perfect for catching the

412
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,800
 mood of the people you're interacting with.

413
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,400
 But anyway, Elle de Mu was amazing.

414
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,360
 And if any, we want, we quite like the idea of putting a mud onto punctuation, but concluded

415
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,920
 that we didn't have time or energy to do it.

416
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,880
 So if you're listening to this and are like, oh God, I could whip up a mud for punctuation

417
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,760
 in 10 minutes flat and I'd be happy to, please get in touch.

418
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,640
 This that you can go and use the one from Rogreic celebration if you like, but I think,

419
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,840
 you know, they literally wrote it for that conference.

420
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,840
 And so while it's open source, it is not open source, but ready and easy and friendly

421
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,040
 to deploy right now.

422
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:44,560
 So it, one of the things about these conventions which have successful social environments is

423
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:53,200
 that it seems to be very obvious that a mud is a great environment for people who are

424
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,200
 going to a Rogreic conference because they're probably pretty used to interacting through

425
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
 mud.

426
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,360
 Zasky Rogreics are very much the sort of thing which anyone going to a Rogreic convention

427
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,720
 is going to be up for or at least have familiarity with.

428
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,360
 And in the same way, when I went to the 3D convention, their social spaces were very

429
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,640
 successful and one of the ones that was successful was the actual virtual reality space because

430
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,320
 a significant proportion of the members of that convention already own VR headsets and

431
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,600
 VR space is a great for socialization.

432
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,040
 Like second life because you can actually wander around in a much more natural way than any

433
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,840
 of the flat, flat social environments that we've found so far.

434
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600
 No, and I think that's a good point.

435
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:53,480
 Like, I think there is a certain level of buy-in that a gaming convention will have for

436
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,240
 gaming inspired social tools.

437
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,800
 And that was something that the UK Games Expo also leveraged although apparently the big

438
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:08,120
 gaming convention in Germany, Spiel, often referred to as Essen, apparently their online

439
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
 spaces are a bit awful.

440
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,040
 I've not actually looked really myself but I've heard from a couple of friends that their

441
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,360
 online solution is not very good, which is a shame.

442
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,000
 Obviously, we're not planning to do a mud punctuation because they're a phenomenon of

443
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,920
 our work and we don't know how to do it as our lesson says, if you could do it, please

444
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,120
 volunteer because that would be awesome.

445
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,080
 But it is interesting to see people kind of trying to take a more lateral view of how

446
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,600
 we could solve some of these problems because I do think that like the Zoom Discord model

447
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:46,280
 has some pretty significant flaws and I am interested in kind of how we can come up with

448
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:53,120
 alternatives which maybe do better at some of these things and I think this looked like

449
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,520
 quite an imaginative way of doing it.

450
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,960
 And I may not be familiar with muds but I did write the most popular walkthrough for

451
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,040
 the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy text based adventure on gamefakus.com to go and

452
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,520
 check that out.

453
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,240
 Speaking of games which must have come out before you were born, John.

454
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
 Yeah.

455
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
 I played that when it was new.

456
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
 I have a puppy.

457
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,240
 I mean, at the time it was one of my favourite, it was just extraordinary.

458
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,920
 I mean, it is quite a hard game and we didn't have any walkthroughs then.

459
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,360
 We just had to kind of cry and then we meet people in the pub.

460
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,600
 Do you remember that?

461
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,760
 And we go, oh my God, I'm so stuck on this terrible game.

462
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,000
 And amongst other things, it has a point where if you didn't do something at the beginning

463
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,080
 of the game like approximately 8,000 turns ago, you are now f***ed.

464
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,200
 Which is what we call in modern terms, bad game design.

465
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
 A negative play experience.

466
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,600
 Yeah, I was going to say I obviously fall between these tools because while I did not

467
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:57,720
 ever write a walkthrough for gamefaks, I do remember buying the walkthrough to a LucasArts

468
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,320
 adventure game from an advert in the back of a game magazine for like £2.50 and they

469
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,920
 sent you like a photocopied sheet listing everything you should do.

470
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,720
 So I could unlock Atlantis, I think?

471
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,240
 Yeah, it was high quality.

472
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,760
 And then of course the internet came along and destroyed that.

473
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,120
 Oh God, remember the small ads in the back of games magazines?

474
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,680
 They were the best.

475
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
 Yeah.

476
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,880
 I remember rigging.

477
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,800
 You could ring a number.

478
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,360
 You could ring an '08, '08, '70.

479
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,480
 Maybe it was even an '09 number to get the answers to questions.

480
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,000
 And a woman will give you hints in a very breathy voice.

481
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Ha ha ha.

482
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,680
 No, it was a man, it was a Scottish man, I'm pretty sure.

483
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,040
 But I was stuck on Final Fantasy Adventure on the Game Boy, which was a game that came

484
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,200
 out the year I was born, and it did not have a good walkthrough on the internet.

485
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,640
 And there's a bit where you have to like take a riddle and use it in order to open a door.

486
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,200
 And it was like, I can't remember what the riddle was.

487
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,840
 But the answer to the riddle was you had to walk around two palm trees in the desert in

488
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,440
 a anti-clockwise figure of eight or something like that.

489
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,200
 And I had to call a helpline to get that piece of information so I could continue on.

490
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
 Great game.

491
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,560
 Just got very stuck on that one bit.

492
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,640
 Happy memories.

493
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,400
 If you have never played the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you should-

494
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,520
 We will put a link in the show notes.

495
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,400
 You should do it because it's fantastic, but I'm going to tell you now and for free,

496
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,680
 read the sandwich to the dog. You will thank me later.

497
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,280
 I just have a sandwich right. I'm pretty sure it's a sandwich.

498
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,560
 Yeah, you've got to feed that dog.

499
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:48,080
 And you've got to- You need to take your junk mail with you.

500
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
 Don't leave the junk mail behind.

501
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,920
 Yeah, I mean in general though, for difficult measures, adventures do not leave anything

502
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,560
 behind. I mean, take everything.

503
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,200
 Yeah, it'll all be useful.

504
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,560
 Yeah, no. If you get to the end of the game and you're going to need everything, yeah.

505
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,160
 And it's not the junk mail, it's the feeding the sandwich to the dog, which is very much

506
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,200
 non-obvious thing to do.

507
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,520
 And yeah.

508
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,600
 And you do have to have done it.

509
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,440
 I'll link to my walkthrough in the show notes.

510
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,560
 If you are someone who would find it more fun not to be enormously frustrated.

511
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,240
 Yeah, especially, you know, you're going to get stuck for weeks otherwise.

512
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,160
 I kind of have a no walkthrough policy for games, which I'm kind of relenting on.

513
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,120
 And I'm kind of going to, oh, now I do walkthroughs and you go, oh, God, was that even

514
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
 a thing?

515
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
 So yeah.

516
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
 Okay.

517
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,040
 We digressed slightly.

518
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,160
 Let's talk about our convention.

519
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,440
 That was a elegant segue.

520
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,000
 Nailed it.

521
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,600
 So punctuation coming up 13th to the 15th of November, 2020.

522
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
 We have some members.

523
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,800
 I believe we now have 88 members.

524
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,640
 So it's going to be a swinging time.

525
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,760
 Lots of people talking on the discord already.

526
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,520
 And yeah, hopefully it'll be good.

527
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,920
 Sorry, 90 members, 90 members.

528
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,800
 Two thirds of the This Never Happens podcast have joined up.

529
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,720
 I leave it to the audience to guess what the third person is.

530
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,400
 And yes, Alison is wetting herself in the background.

531
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:25,080
 Okay, so that's a thing about middle age and he's, ow.

532
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,800
 That was a very deep encapsulation of the effects of middle age in audio for.

533
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,000
 Oh, yeah, no, that was so sorry, Alison.

534
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,600
 Crick, cricks of the deck are horrible.

535
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 They really are.

536
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,320
 But yes, I think our convention will be very good.

537
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,240
 One of the things we have been trying to do in order to make our convention better is

538
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,200
 to find out from the people we know and the people who might be coming.

539
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,280
 While things they miss about interacting with people in the real world and trying to think

540
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:04,400
 about how we might be able to emulate or get out the same kind of feelings in a virtual

541
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
 space.

542
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,160
 And this is something that Alison posted a Facebook comment about, sorry, Facebook post

543
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,840
 about in order to try and get people's opinions.

544
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,440
 So Alison, do you want to talk a little bit about that?

545
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,680
 I think you basically said roughly what I was going to say, which is that I asked people

546
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:26,640
 what things they used to enjoy and if they can't do them now, how have they replicated

547
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
 it online?

548
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:32,160
 And I did get some answers that were kind of the thing I enjoyed doing is impossible

549
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
 to replicate online.

550
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,400
 But I got quite a lot of answers that weren't like that and came up with quite a lot of

551
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:44,280
 quite good ideas for things that you can do socially, including obviously the things we

552
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,320
 already know like, like Zooms and Borg gaming and and knitted natter type event, you know,

553
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,280
 the sorts of you could do your crafting workshops online and you could do lots of things where

554
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,160
 you're socializing and but also doing something like playing a game or crafting.

555
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,360
 Some whole slew of things which are kind of not quite as satisfactory.

556
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:17,560
 I think one of the things that we've lost and we may never get back is voices joining together

557
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:23,160
 in song or people playing together as a band in a way that the internet is not delivering

558
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,400
 at all at the moment.

559
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,480
 And so music is one of the things that the ways that we're doing things online kind of

560
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,360
 involve turn taking and solo performance.

561
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
 But lots of interesting ideas.

562
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:44,560
 Lots of people saying, well, the thing I used to really like was getting drunk with a load

563
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,160
 of my mates and behaving hugely and appropriately.

564
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,040
 And I think that's an issue, isn't it?

565
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,720
 You know, I feel that sort of sense that I'm never going to get pissed in a space that's

566
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,280
 not surrounded by my actual own home is a problem for me.

567
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,640
 #NotAnAlcoholic I promise, maybe if I had a beer it would suse my neck.

568
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,160
 It do write to us about the things that you are doing that are translatable online and

569
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,760
 are not translatable online.

570
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,800
 And it was quite, you know, it was kind of people kind of talking about what they're

571
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:26,480
 doing to make up for not having air shows and all the different sorts of activities that

572
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,240
 people would normally have done in their spare time.

573
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,560
 And that's, so we've got to replicate some of those at punctuation if we can.

574
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:41,720
 And we are very keen to listen to how other people, if you are someone who feels poorly

575
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:49,440
 served by the way in which socialising and conventions have been in the pandemic, please

576
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,600
 write to us and tell us what the things you have trouble with are because we may not be

577
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,080
 able to fix them, but we would like to think about them.

578
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:04,320
 But particularly if you have a different hobby space where people are doing things better

579
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:11,360
 that science fiction conventions have not yet worked out how to do, then do tell us because

580
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,400
 we do want to steal good practice from other sorts of events.

581
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,360
 Yep, good artists, good artists borrow great artists steal.

582
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,320
 I do miss going out and singing in groups, but that's just one of the few things that

583
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,680
 hasn't restarted them.

584
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,840
 We tried to have a sing-along on Zoom and it was very funny, but if what you're missing

585
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,720
 from Sing-alongs isn't the hilariousness of time lags on the internet causing it to

586
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,000
 sound awful, I'm not sure whether the way we tried to solve it will help.

587
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,240
 Apparently that's what we're going to get from 5G.

588
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,280
 Whenever people go, "Oh, 5G is a solution waiting for a problem," which it certainly

589
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:57,560
 is, it should be possible to use 5G networks to eliminate lag and allow for essentially

590
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,280
 spontaneous activity like singing and music making.

591
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,520
 I do think now we've got gigabyte fibre, then I think the next obvious frontier is reducing

592
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
 latency.

593
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,160
 I mean, obviously you can get really easily bitten in the butt by saying this, but no

594
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,200
 one could possibly need more into that than gigabit fibre.

595
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,200
 Right?

596
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,480
 But certainly at the point where it's fine for streaming 4K video, I kind of feel like

597
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,960
 maybe the next job is to reduce the latency.

598
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,480
 But the put-back cables is that cables have limits based on repeaters and contention that

599
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,920
 mean that they are not achieving.

600
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,960
 The speed of light is not a hard, you know, the amount of time it takes to light to go

601
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,920
 all the way around the world is not very great.

602
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,240
 So that's probably not going to stop you singing with your friends.

603
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:57,520
 That was the 17th episode of the Octa Thorp podcast and it's goodbye from me.

604
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
 It's goodbye from me.

605
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,320
 And it's goodbye from me.

606
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,320
 The theme music of this episode is "Spanfair for Space" by Kevin Macleod at Incompetech.com

607
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:23,400
 used under a creative commons attribution treatment point of license.

608
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,280
 We haven't done a staying sail in the apocalypse for a while.

609
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,480
 I mean, we've hugely digressed many times.

610
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,880
 We haven't done a formal staying sail in the apocalypse segment for a while.

611
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,480
 So Alison, why does your neck hurt?

612
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,840
 So about six years ago, I was a science fiction convention or some similar event and Alex

613
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,600
 Holden, who is a science fiction fan, sidled up to me and said, "I am thinking of going

614
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,920
 into business as a high-end concertina maker.

615
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,120
 Does that sound like a stupid idea?"

616
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,640
 And I said, "No, Alex.

617
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,700
 That sounds like an extremely good idea because there is a massive shortage of high-end

618
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:03,640
 concertina makers and once you get the hang of it, you will sell everyone that you make

619
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,980
 because you know."

620
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,900
 So there is a question about whether you can actually make them in a commercial way that

621
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,540
 makes you money, but subject to that, yeah, it appears to be a great business to go into.

622
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,020
 And let me know when you've got the hang of making concertinas and I will have a concertina

623
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
 off you.

624
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,020
 All right.

625
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,820
 So with me so far, so about two years ago, he came back to me.

626
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,060
 He learned how to build a concertina and he made a couple of concertinas and they came

627
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:31,020
 back to me and said, "My order book is starting to fill up and I am starting to raise my

628
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,420
 prices and would you like to put down a deposit on a concertina before I raise the prices?"

629
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,100
 Seeing as you said you would.

630
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,820
 And I was like, "Absolutely.

631
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,820
 That sounds amazing."

632
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,980
 He said, "It'll be about eight months."

633
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,780
 And that was about two years ago.

634
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:51,340
 So I have a concertina which I got this week and I should say in Alex's defense that about

635
00:40:51,340 --> 00:41:00,620
 four months of that was my fault because I decided I wanted amazingly fancy bellows,

636
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,100
 papers designed by Sumaces.

637
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:07,300
 We will put a picture of my incredibly beautiful Holden Dumberate concertina in the show notes

638
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,060
 or you can even use it as the chapter title, John.

639
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,060
 I will.

640
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,060
 Yeah.

641
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,060
 When I'll get your photo.

642
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,500
 I mean, it's only going to be the same photo that I had as my zoom background or something.

643
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,820
 Anyway, so I got it on Tuesday and I cannot play concertina at all.

644
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,500
 I play Melodian.

645
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:29,260
 How I've been explaining this to people is that if you, it's like going to a Jvorak

646
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,540
 keyboard.

647
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:37,180
 So you were, you need to kind of relearn the way you type.

648
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,660
 And also there are some other things that are different.

649
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:45,300
 So I can now after five days of extremely concentrated concertina practice, I can now

650
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:51,140
 play concertina very badly and I am going to a all day concertina workshop just as soon

651
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,420
 as we finish recording.

652
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
 So anyway, I've played concertina.

653
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,620
 You're supposed to build up very, very slowly about kind of 30 minutes a day when you get

654
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:04,060
 a new instrument into 15 minute chunks so that you don't do something like massively

655
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,020
 put your neck out due to playing concertina for six hours.

656
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,220
 Anyway, there's the end of the story.

657
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,980
 So I woke up this morning with a spectacularly stiff neck as a result of playing too much

658
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,260
 concertina which would not really be a big problem.

659
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,580
 We're not the fact that we're recording the podcast and then I'm going to an all day

660
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,340
 concertina workshop, which I'm not sure how much concertina play I'm going to be able

661
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,340
 to do with that pain.

662
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
 Concertina is they're great.

663
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,100
 If you'd like, we'll also put a link to Alex's Instagram where he has a lot of exceptionally

664
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,780
 beautiful photographs.

665
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:45,220
 If you like photographs of squeeze boxes and also his website where you too could purchase

666
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,300
 a had built concertina.

667
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,700
 So my concertina was a very prodigious bargain.

668
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,180
 I assume as a result of that conversation I had with Alex six years ago.

669
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,060
 I think he charges a lot more for them now than he charged me, but it's still, it's still

670
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,700
 you know, if you need a concertina definitely the place to go.

671
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,580
 Obviously they're hand built traditionally made concertinas and they are not cheap, but

672
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,580
 they give.

673
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,900
 It is spectacularly beautiful.

674
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,420
 It made me want to buy one even though my own experience is attempting to play the

675
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,420
 melodian and being really bad at it and giving up.

676
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:24,980
 Yeah, I would say that I should probably have started from the beginning, which is in 1829.

677
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:34,500
 I was Wheatstone who invented a great many things put down having seen German small

678
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,580
 accordions which were instruments for playing chords on made a patent to make a hexagonal

679
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:46,580
 instrument which he called the concertina and that is essentially the start of the instrument.

680
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:54,460
 And instruments much like mine have been made since about 1840 or 1850 and they haven't

681
00:43:54,460 --> 00:44:00,660
 really changed a design very much since the in the last 140 years.

682
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:06,580
 So would you say that it's an area which is rape for Silicon Valley disruption?

683
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:15,620
 No, but it's clear some of the things that Alex is doing are about applying being a modern

684
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:22,180
 person with a modern sort of brain because Alex isn't actually a folky, but he's clearly,

685
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,220
 he's coming at it from the point of view of being a person who can make things.

686
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,500
 So he is actually being his concertinas are quite disruptive, for example, by the way,

687
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,300
 has aluminium reeds which is quite a disruptive thing to do.

688
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,300
 Yeah.

689
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,380
 And as a result, it's very light.

690
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,380
 Nice.

691
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,620
 Or aluminium reed frames rather.

692
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,620
 Yeah.

693
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,860
 Your story about being very achy reminds me of the time.

694
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:51,300
 So I went on holiday with my three brothers and my mother and my father to Newqui and

695
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,580
 my mum and dad said they do surfing lessons.

696
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,580
 You want to learn to surf?

697
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,580
 And I was like, what?

698
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,460
 Your dyspraxic son with no sense of balance.

699
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,660
 Now you can pull the other one.

700
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,220
 It's got bells on.

701
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,060
 But two of my brothers did want to learn surf because they don't have to sprax your

702
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,740
 and can balance.

703
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,740
 And so they did.

704
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:12,260
 And they decided to surf and then they decided to spend the morning with surfing lesson and

705
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,500
 they decided they would keep surfing all after doodie evening.

706
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,660
 And the next day they had like wounds on their feet.

707
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:25,220
 We had to go and get antiseptic dressings like they ached all over because if you just

708
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:30,460
 if you don't have a break, yeah, you don't notice until the next day how much stress is

709
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,540
 putting on your body.

710
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,180
 And the answer was many.

711
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,060
 So I was cheerfully just sort of stretching and generally walking to places and they were

712
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,300
 really having trouble with those kinds of activities.

713
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:46,060
 So so yeah, it's like the day after I did ring fit adventure and re-January knows the

714
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,500
 ache is real.

715
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,460
 I have two more things to say on that.

716
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,460
 One is a response to you.

717
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,700
 One is one of the things I actually put in the show notes, which is thank you so much

718
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,740
 for your recommendation to download a program called Buddy move, which stops you sitting

719
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,980
 in one place for a long time and make sure you do stretching exercises.

720
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,060
 I had downloaded it, but I had not installed it.

721
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,940
 Apparently you also need to install it and act on the things it tells you do before it

722
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,940
 works.

723
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,260
 Yeah, that's the.

724
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:18,340
 And the second thing is that my I used to ride horses periodically as a small child in

725
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,940
 the way that small girls tend to.

726
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,660
 And I never, you know, obviously horse riding is one of the things where you can overdo

727
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,660
 it.

728
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:30,060
 But in fact, I never really did have a problem with a child, including go for an entire week

729
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,060
 horse riding.

730
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:38,900
 But then about 10 years after I'd never after I'd written, we were in Brecken for Brecken,

731
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,820
 which was the Hey on why convention, one of the Hey on why conventions that got organized

732
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,460
 in the in the Swan Hotel in Hay that had no program.

733
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:53,420
 But Caroline Mullen organized a pony trek for people who liked that sort of thing.

734
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,580
 And I went pony trekking for three hours.

735
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,860
 And the following day I was in very significant amounts of really spectacularly saw after

736
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,860
 that.

737
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,100
 So yeah, amazing.

738
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,180
 I blowed Caroline.

739
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:14,860
 So Liz, you've been staying sane in the apocalypse by eating cakes that have been sprayed with

740
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,860
 rum.

741
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:21,780
 So I saw this post on your Instagram and I knew we had to cover it on the podcast.

742
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,780
 So could you please tell us where to go in order to get a cake spray painted with rum?

743
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,140
 Oh, I went out for afternoon tea.

744
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,700
 What can I have questions?

745
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,700
 What is out?

746
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:42,540
 Yeah, I'm saying you met friends for an indoor meal.

747
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,540
 Yes.

748
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,620
 OK, so we're already fizzing with excitement and jealousy.

749
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,340
 Yeah, I try not to mention it too much when it's on staying sane in the apocalypse because

750
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,060
 Alison, you know, is saying how sad it is that she can't basically go out and get smashed

751
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,740
 and do inadvisable things.

752
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,740
 And I could if I wanted to go out and get smashed and do inadvisable things and I wouldn't

753
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,740
 have to do it.

754
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:07,820
 Because every Tuesday, you listener, if you ring Liz on a Tuesday after about seven in

755
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,500
 the afternoon, for all, she's so getty said, Zavar.

756
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,900
 So I went out for afternoon tea, which is a thing you can do when the cases of COVID

757
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,420
 are minimal, I understand.

758
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:24,180
 And yeah, we went for fancy afternoon tea for my friend's birthday treat.

759
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,020
 And you know, it's a sort of place where they bring you a tea menu and then they bring

760
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:32,220
 you lots of little tiny cakes and scones.

761
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,780
 But the start thing is they bring you a rum Baba cake, which had matcha cream on top.

762
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,260
 And then they ask you, would, would you like it sprits with rum and either pineapple or

763
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,260
 mango flavoring?

764
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:46,540
 And I said, yes, please, I don't know if you did anything at all to taste, but it's

765
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,180
 quite fun to have someone come and sort of spray rum on your cake.

766
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,380
 Like it's from a tiny perfume dispenser.

767
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,620
 That is excellent.

768
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:59,820
 And when international travel is possible again, I'm coming to visit you in Bangkok,

769
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,820
 a photo show.

770
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,380
 And we're going out for fancy afternoon tea.

771
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,380
 Yeah.

772
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,860
 Oh, can we, can we like have like an octa-sore holiday in Bangkok, Adam?

773
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,940
 And do the podcast for real there?

774
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,940
 One day, one day, that would be great.

775
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:22,940
 So I, so, so yes, so on the topic of seeing friends, I have been staying sane in the

776
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:29,620
 apocalypse by purchasing an outdoor infrared heater and putting it in my garden.

777
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,380
 And there is access to my garden from outside.

778
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,780
 So you'd have to come through my house.

779
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,220
 And my table is about to be too wide.

780
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,460
 So I could have a friend at the other end of the table and we can have tea and there

781
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,380
 is a heater and I've got a little sheltered bit of the garden.

782
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,100
 So the rain doesn't get us unless it's a yellow rainwater, which I postpone.

783
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,140
 And so I've had a couple of friends from work over in the last couple of weeks for sort

784
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,940
 of morning tea breaks.

785
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:59,660
 And that has been brilliant, would highly recommend living in a semi-detached house with a garden

786
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:06,220
 and then buying a heater for the garden and having friends come over to enjoy tea.

787
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,140
 I appreciate not everyone listening will have that list of things.

788
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:15,700
 But I will put a link in the show notes to the outdoor heater I procured.

789
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,380
 And, and yeah, it's very exciting.

790
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,980
 And I have been thoroughly enjoying it.

791
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,980
 It was Spanish idea.

792
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,980
 I can claim no credit at all for the planning phase of this.

793
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,980
 But it's bad.

794
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,780
 He said very tentatively, can we do this?

795
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,380
 And I was like, yes, go and find which one we're buying now.

796
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:38,620
 And she was like, oh, I was not expecting that level of buy in that quickly.

797
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,820
 But yeah, it's as I miss people being able to see people is nice.

798
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,380
 And that has been because I think I'd be lisual no more about this.

799
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:52,820
 But the impression I get from reading the news and the learned people about COVID is that

800
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:58,420
 outdoor transmission is a good deal less of a problem than the risk from indoor transmission.

801
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:04,940
 And so I think seeing one friend at a time for outdoor pursuits seems pretty safe generally.

802
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,300
 I'm going to say slightly edgyly.

803
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,580
 At least some of that, though, is going to be that we cannot, we are less likely to know

804
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,700
 when the transmission happened when it's at an outdoor thing.

805
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,860
 So but yeah, no, it's clear that outdoor events are much, much safer.

806
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,980
 Though not that the Amy Barrett thing in the Rose Garden clearly spread it to lots of people

807
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,980
 despite being outdoors.

808
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,740
 So it's not 100%.

809
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,020
 That was not entirely outdoors.

810
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,020
 It had indoor sections.

811
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,140
 Ah, that's good to know.

812
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:37,820
 Well, but also what I haven't done is I haven't lined my garden with seats, which are next

813
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,140
 to each other and put 300 people in it.

814
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,140
 So that is also.

815
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,140
 Yeah.

816
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,140
 Yeah.

817
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,420
 You can't actually get to my garden without going through my house.

818
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,780
 So I'm always slightly edgy about the whole outdoor thing.

819
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,980
 I've just realized what your statement means, Alison.

820
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:58,500
 It means that this was the secret emergency podcast about Trump's coronavirus.

821
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:03,260
 Because we mentioned the Rose Garden meeting and outdoor and indoor transmission.

822
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,980
 So listeners that have been waiting on 10 to hook.

823
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,980
 It was this episode.

824
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,700
 I've done two other things to say saying in the apocalypse, which is firstly, I've deleted

825
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:18,980
 my weekly reminder to nag Alison for TAF Art because Alison has given me TAF Art and

826
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,340
 that means my TAF report is finished.

827
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,740
 So it is about to be on sale.

828
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,740
 Okay.

829
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:30,620
 For the benefit of people listening who are not on Facebook, John posted to Facebook saying,

830
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:38,580
 I have finished my TAF report and I followed up with, that's a very kind way to say, Alison

831
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,260
 finally delivered the bloody cover, only seven months late, isn't it?

832
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:50,820
 I mean, but I will say that of the nine years that it took me to deliver my TAF report,

833
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,860
 less than 10% of that was your doing.

834
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,740
 So I think in general, it could be safely said that I took most of the time on my own.

835
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,740
 Yeah.

836
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,980
 I mean, I think it was only a bit late.

837
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:08,100
 It would have been done for Easter if we'd had Easter and sometimes, sometimes, you know,

838
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,180
 this happened when they happened and I'm quite pleased with the cover now that it's done.

839
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,180
 Oh, yeah.

840
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,180
 Me too.

841
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,180
 It's not your fault.

842
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,180
 It took a long time.

843
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,620
 It took a long time because I decided you ought to wear Arthur Dent's dressing gown and

844
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:23,540
 instead of just saying, "I'm going to take the photo, I found a suitable dressing gown

845
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:31,380
 on the internet and used Photoshop's puppet warp to add it to your body digitally."

846
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,460
 And then I thought, "Oh, that ribbon crawl."

847
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:39,140
 It is fantastic, listener, like I cannot.

848
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:45,220
 Ribbon crawl should automatically have the sort of ribbons that John would actually wear

849
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,300
 attached to his combat.

850
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,540
 So I photoshopped all the ribbons individually, which was probably a bit stupid, but will

851
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:57,220
 be useful for punctuation where a lot of these ribbons are going to get you reused.

852
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:02,500
 And if you have any ideas for great con ribbons that you'd like to take to a con, let us

853
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,340
 know and I'll photoshopped them up before punctuation.

854
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,540
 But that was one of the things I did that did not help.

855
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,740
 It's also what I'm talking about, muscle pain.

856
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:16,940
 It's not impossible that the very large number of hours I spent on photoshopped this week,

857
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,340
 where again, I could have done with somebody to tell me to get up and stretch a bit more

858
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,580
 often, might actually also have had something to do with my neck.

859
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,700
 This is not in any way meant to be a guilt trip.

860
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,740
 It's definitely mostly the concertina.

861
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,460
 Apparently I have terrible, terrible health habits.

862
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:36,420
 Steve was like, that's why I do a set of Chigong exercises every day that I decided to prevent

863
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,700
 this sort of thing.

864
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,900
 And he was very lucky not to have a microwavable dragon throw at him, I can tell you.

865
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:48,940
 And I also yesterday spent 13 and a quarter hours playing Arkham Horror the Card Game or

866
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:55,220
 my computer with three people from across the world in an Ironman run of the circle

867
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,220
 and done.

868
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,220
 And we won.

869
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,380
 I sat down at my computer at about 8.20 and I stood up again at about 10 o'clock and

870
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:10,740
 it's been brought the water, coffee, pancakes, a little eggbook muffin, a re-imagination

871
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:16,460
 of a Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme, some toast and biscuits.

872
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,820
 And she is a 10 out of 10 spouse.

873
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,500
 Thank you very much, darling.

874
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,300
 And if you do that in 20 years time, you'll wake up the following day with a majestic stiff

875
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,300
 deck.

876
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:34,820
 What I did was, firstly, I stood up every time my watch bleated at me, so that helped.

877
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:39,180
 But I also went for a run immediately after finishing, which I think might have also helped

878
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,780
 blow some of the cobwebs out.

879
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,180
 Although it was a pretty slow run, I will admit.

880
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,860
 That is all that I've done, stay sane in the apocalypse.

881
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,060
 But I feel like it's been a pretty full fortnight.

882
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:54,020
 I should say that I saw my daughter in the outdoors yesterday.

883
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,740
 I love the family that she with her girlfriend.

884
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,460
 Oh, because she's not living with her family.

885
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,460
 Yeah.

886
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,180
 So along with Marianne and Marianne's girlfriend and Marianne's girlfriend's family, which

887
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,500
 made seven in total.

888
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,900
 So we actually went on our walk in two non-mingling groups.

889
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:14,140
 And then we got back before the other group because obviously it had me in it and Marianne.

890
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:19,220
 And we found ourselves, we went, it was a much shorter walk, I should stress.

891
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:23,140
 And we found ourselves at a pub that would be converted to a steakhouse.

892
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,540
 And so we sat outside this pub that would be converted into a steakhouse and sent Stephen

893
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,900
 in to see if he could get us three copies.

894
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,460
 And they said, we only serve drinks with meals, I'm afraid.

895
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,780
 And so we said, can we have the menu?

896
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:36,820
 And they said, certainly, but you would have to sit out inside because we cannot serve food

897
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,900
 outside.

898
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:43,060
 And I'm just waiting for this company to announce that they've got a bust as a result of COVID.

899
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,540
 And I'm going, you know what?

900
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,740
 You need to work out how you can serve meals outside.

901
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,940
 And I know you're not supposed to ever say anything that could be finished with the words

902
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,940
 you idiot, but there we go.

903
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:58,220
 You should learn how to serve meals outside you idiots.

904
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:03,860
 If your pub is empty, you should also serve people coffees, even if they're not eating

905
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,780
 a meal because money is money.

906
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,940
 You idiots, yeah, like that.

907
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,940
 So I would have liked to have had a coffee with my daughter afterward gov for a walk.

908
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:19,540
 The obvious proviso is unless you're in a tier three lockdown city in which you're not

909
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,820
 allowed to serve drinks with our meal.

910
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:26,860
 We are in a tier two space as was the thing and they are allowed to serve drinks.

911
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,620
 No, no, seriously, there are alcohol.

912
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,620
 Those are alcoholic drinks.

913
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,940
 You're allowed to serve coffee without a meal.

914
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,940
 Okay.

915
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,500
 So, so that's the other thing is that somebody was like, Oh, that can't be able to serve

916
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,860
 drinks without food, might be a licensing requirement.

917
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,940
 There is no license on coffee yet, which is honestly a good thing for me because obviously

918
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,420
 addict and everything.

919
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,260
 I remember I went to a long gone three committee meeting with Claire Briley of Croydon and I

920
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:59,220
 saw her order a point of coffee and a triple espresso and poured the triple espresso into

921
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,540
 the coffee.

922
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,340
 Civil service life.

923
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,980
 I believe that leaving the civil service has helped with Claire's caffeine addiction,

924
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,860
 but I'm sure she's going to be along in a minute to tell us.

925
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,700
 I don't think she drinks as much coffee as she used to.

926
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,060
 She used to drink enough coffee that made my hair stand on end.

927
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,060
 This podcast will end at the beat.

928
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,560
 *burps*
