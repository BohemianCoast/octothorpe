00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 Hello everyone, it's John here just letting you know we're aware that Alison has some music

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,240
 bleeding through in the La Half of the podcast. Alison very kindly recorded while she was at a

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,520
 festival in a field but unfortunately we hadn't quite grasped what that would mean for the audio

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,960
 scape. Hopefully it doesn't impede your enjoyment too much but we'll be back to a regular service

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:34,320
 next episode. See you all after the music.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:50,560
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 87th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction and

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,200
 science fiction fandom. This episode is coming to you on the 6th of July 2023. I'm John Coxon,

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:07,360
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and we have some letters of comment. So sometimes we have

9
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,760
 tweets of comment, Twitter broke. So if you sent us a tweet a comment please try sending it again

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,760
 on a different social network. Thank you, we love you all, we love hearing from you.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:26,160
 Christopher J Garcia wrote in as he usually does. A day late, I swear I will speedily listen next

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:34,400
 week. We will be watching Chris. Chris says lots of things all of which are good. He saw a moose

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,680
 in person once, it was about eight feet tall and it was in chill mode and that is about the opposite

14
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,520
 of Alison in both respects. Because Alison is not eight feet tall and is perhaps not as chill as a

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:54,320
 moose. I am pretty chill, I do not, I very rarely stampede at people and flack them with my giant

16
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:02,880
 antlers. I would also say that a moose is considerably more deadly than Alison that is another way in

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:12,160
 which you are differentiated. Oh you just crossed me. Listeners, if you could write in and tell us

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
 whether you'd rather have a fight with Alison or a fight with a moose and we will read out the

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,760
 best responses next episode. Would you rather have a fight with 100 Alison sized moose or one

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,600
 moose sized Alison? Chris, Chris did pick us up on some pronunciation. He says never call it Los

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,200
 Angeles, it's Los Angeles. And also if we need stunt versions of ourselves Chris volunteers to

22
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,040
 portray John Coxon. He might be able to pull off a reasonable Liz but he's been working on his

23
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,760
 Coxon delivery since 2009 and he's awesome at it. What I now want to see is whether Chris could

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,440
 do all three of us. Well we know that we've done it on the cover. Well that was all three of us

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,480
 doing Chris. No I was just going to say about Chris's letter that I think Chris Garcia I think

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,560
 is the man with the most energy who could do all three of us convincingly during a live episode and

27
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,960
 I would like to see that. Yep and I'd like to see that at a Californian convention but obviously

28
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,440
 in Eastercon I'd want it to be Tobe's. Ooh I think that would be funny. Yeah I'm okay with that. We

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,240
 also heard from Anne-Gell Nussbaum who writes in and apologizes for confusing Alison.

30
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,320
 Adliss I think. Would you rather confuse Alison or confuse a moose?

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:32,880
 No no I knew what was going on. I knew what was going on. I just let you finish before I

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,960
 pointed out that you got the wrong end of the sick. Oh my god that's so much worse.

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,280
 I don't like to interrupt people John. No I don't listen as may know I don't have that

34
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,680
 character character as a judge described. Yes but Abigail would like to clarify that the most

35
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,240
 recommended Francis Harding novels are Gullsford Carlin, Skimfleshadows, Verdigree, Deep,

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,720
 and a Facelight class and I've read three of those and they're all good so go for it. Which ties in

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,200
 very nicely to an email we got from Karen Shafer thanking us for our recommendation over Facelight

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,880
 class and they read it just before listening to the discussion just like a book club. It's just

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,080
 like a book club except we get to pontificate for like an hour and then you get to write as a

40
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,880
 letter of comment that we extract the bits we like from. So it's not quite like a book club.

41
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,320
 Maybe we should announce more often that we're going to do like a book episode and then people

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,560
 can read it. That might be a good idea. Maybe we should. That's a good point. When we record,

43
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,920
 so the next episode we will be doing a book club about will be Six Weeks by Merlafferty which was

44
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,360
 a Hugo Award finalist in I think 2018 which is my pick that I get to make Liz and Alison read

45
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,240
 and I don't know when it will come out. We haven't yet read and recorded the episode and you'll be

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,480
 able to do some behind the scenes cryptography because if it comes out in like August 2024

47
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,720
 you now have an indication of timescale. But we'll let you know when we do record it.

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,960
 Well we'll let you know, I guess we'll let you know when near when it comes out so that people

49
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,360
 can read it closer to the time. But yeah foreshadowing. Something that happened this week is that one

50
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,160
 of file 777 throwback novels was Grass by Sherry Tepper which is my choice for the book that I'm

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,280
 going to make John and Liz read. So I thought it was quite funny that given all of the books in

52
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,640
 all of the world they will pick that one. Of all the books of all the world you had to walk in a

53
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:38,800
 mine. Yeah like that one like that. We heard toots. We had toots of comment. Firstly Peter Sullivan

54
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,160
 says that he's beginning to catch up with the backlog. So obviously he said that and then he

55
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,840
 probably isn't going to listen to this episode for a while. But when you get here, hi Peter.

56
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,840
 And then Raj says he loves Alison's episode art. This is the cricket episode art. It feels like a

57
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,400
 1930 seaside murder mystery where Alison is murdered. John is innocent but is framed for her

58
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,640
 murder because he looks shifty and lizzes the Ditzy but very sharp lady detective who has saw

59
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,840
 everything out. I don't know if that's how it would unfold but we could do it as a play.

60
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,280
 I'm happy to be the Ditzy but sharp lady detective. I think I do get off lightly here.

61
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,760
 I don't want to be murdered. Thank you. I don't really want to be murdered even in the play.

62
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,600
 I don't know how that's so funny but it is. If you were murdered would you want me to investigate

63
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,560
 your murder or jump? Is this hypothetical too far? I wonder if neither is an option if I could

64
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,720
 pick a detective who is not either of you. All of the rights who would it be? Any fan who's

65
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,560
 investigating your murder? Chris Garcia. Chris Garcia. I mean he does have, he is writing a book about

66
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,560
 true crime I think. Yeah speaking to the skill set. I feel like he'd investigate my murder with

67
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,480
 considerable energy. On the subject of cricket Malcolm Hutchison told us on Facebook,

68
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,640
 "What do you mean cricket is an SF no a game created from my racial memory of being attacked by cricket

69
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,440
 robots?" I did think that when we were discussing it and I didn't say it but thank you very much

70
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,480
 for writing up writing in Malcolm that was very good. And also Fara thanked us for the discussion

71
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:28,080
 of COVID ventilation. We have news. We have been nominated for a Hugo Award. Yay.

72
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,080
 So thank you very much. Which answers one important question which we had at the time of recording

73
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,160
 which is will there be any English language finalists on the ballot? And the answer is yes

74
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,920
 because we are. So we're very pleased. Which makes conversations that are being had in theory

75
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,440
 about the Hugo is very difficult because people are loudly asserting there won't be any and I'm

76
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:59,280
 like I know there will be but I can't tell you why. Oh no I have heard elsewhere on gossipy grapevines.

77
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,840
 I heard before we learnt that we were a nominee. I heard that there was at least one English language

78
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,160
 nominee through the grapevine. At time recording we don't know anything else that's on the ballot.

79
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,240
 We're recording this after we receive the you know super secret email. Oh no we do we do we do we do we

80
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,600
 do we do we do we do we actually know two other things that are on the ballot Liz. You know two

81
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,160
 other things on the ballot. I do not know two other things on the ballot. Well I have been nominated

82
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,880
 for my role in a fanzine called journey planet. Congratulations John. I did not know that you did

83
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,360
 not tell me that. Yes I do not obviously do not officially know these things because no one would

84
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,920
 ever you know break the Hugo and Bargo to tell them eight stuff. No well it's tricky I feel like

85
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,800
 you two are good at keeping secrets and also I feel like it would be weird to have this episode

86
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,840
 going out celebrating our Hugo norm as a podcast without mentioning our other Hugo norms.

87
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,280
 Yeah it would yes. I edited the and or issue of journey planet and that was very good.

88
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,160
 Oh thank you. I'm a journey planet did absolutely fantastic work last year and

89
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
 they were definitely on my ballot and I'm sure lots of other people's and I'm very glad to see

90
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,640
 that they're on the thing. So congratulations John and the and or episode issue was fantastic

91
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,440
 even though it had the same joke on the cover that we'd use for octalope and you must have known

92
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
 at the point where you commissioned it for octalope and you did not tell me and I was only a bit

93
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,120
 annoyed and by a bit annoyed I mean absolutely fucking furious. You underestimate how joined up

94
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,520
 the journey planet team is. But you edited that I blame I blame sharing competence.

95
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,920
 I guess I guess a little bit of a look behind the curtain but it's actually usually James who

96
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,000
 does the cover art commissioning. Oh right. Like like so so for all of the episode all of the issues

97
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,280
 of journey planet I have worked on it has been James who commissioned the covers except for the

98
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,760
 matrix issue which I commissioned. James needs to commission a cover for me then doesn't he?

99
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,480
 Because as we know Bob. So on the subject of people who were on

100
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,760
 nomination ballots from other people on the podcast so what else is nominated for a Hugo

101
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,320
 in our company? I am also eligible in best fan artist and I have been nominated for this my first

102
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:31,120
 aye this is my first finalist place for best fan artist and I am very happy because I have

103
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:42,080
 been doing fan art in Fansies and in other places since 1996 so I'm kind of like oh this is amazing

104
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,840
 I didn't think this would ever happen so I'm very pleased. I've sent them a note saying

105
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,800
 here's my eligible stuff and about 13 of those pieces are octa-thorpe covers so thank you guys

106
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,040
 for not only providing me an outlet for my art but also insisting that I do it every two weeks

107
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,160
 because that is what we call good discipline and I'm pretty proud of some of the covers that I did

108
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,520
 in 2022 so do check them out if you've never looked at our cover art we do have cover art

109
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,560
 most issues episodes and most of that's me but some of it's by our other excellent artists

110
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,280
 like Sue Mason and Spanish Shove and Brad Foster we've had it had in 2022 and is that everyone?

111
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,120
 Oh Sarah Felix and if you are a fan artist and we have no invited you to do fan art for our

112
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,160
 podcast please write in because we're very British and coy and what that means is you have to kick

113
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,280
 us to get us to ask you to do things. No no no we will yeah we'd love for you to do us art.

114
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,920
 Yes. We have an art specification but you're welcome to ignore all of it it's only there so

115
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,880
 that you can have ideas to bounce off. Yeah I should say how the process normally goes for the

116
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,680
 fortnightly octa-thorpe artist Alison goes do you have any art prompts guys and I try and come up

117
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,040
 with the most ludicrous one possible like saying can we all be mouse detectives or can we have

118
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,720
 a commemorative plates and then Alison somehow makes them into something amazing. It is very good.

119
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:13,040
 On the subject of being nominated for Hugo Awards the Hugo Award finalists are out but at the

120
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,160
 recording time we do not know what they are because they weren't when we recorded. I'm gonna say that

121
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,760
 I worked on the Hugo team a couple of years ago for the Disc on 300th Hugo vote packet.

122
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:34,320
 This entire area of Worldcon work is tedious for nickety hard work that takes ages even if you don't

123
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,080
 theoretically have a load of nominations in a language you don't understand with a lot of

124
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,920
 different conventions for how titles are portrayed so I mean I feel like they've probably had a

125
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,480
 bucket load of work to do and we should cut them a load of slack and the people are not cutting

126
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,160
 them a load of slack yeah should take a chill pill because I'm sure it's going to get sorted out

127
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,640
 and the hugas will be awarded and it will all be lovely but they did say that they would have it

128
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,760
 done by the end of June and it's now the second of July as we record. So and I would say I mean

129
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,360
 my experience of Worldcon deadlines is generally you have a deadline you set an advance and then

130
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,840
 like it slips by a couple of weeks and then sometimes it slips by a bit more but most of these

131
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,840
 deadlines because they're not as public facing as a Hugo's no one really notices or cares about them

132
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,680
 as long as you actually get it done in time and you build in enough slack into the system that

133
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,840
 your deadline is always well we're going to do it now and then if it slips by a couple of weeks it

134
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,120
 won't actually you know cause any massive problems it will just tighten up all your timescales so

135
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,440
 hopefully they will get them out and still give people a good couple of months to read everything

136
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,640
 um I guess the timescales for the Hugo packet do get a little bit tight if that slips well

137
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,520
 assuming there is a Hugo packet if that slips as far as the nominees have that might be a little

138
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,120
 bit difficult if people are relying on that to read things but yeah I would just urge people to get

139
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,720
 on with getting books out from the library and reading what fiction is free online and you know

140
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,240
 engaging with whatever else they can get their hands on before the Hugo packet if they're worried

141
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,640
 about running out of time. Three of us know that there are finalists out there uh the file 770

142
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:15,520
 comments Paul Weimer notes that he knows that someone has been notified they're a finalist so they

143
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,600
 are clearly going through so like it's not like no one has heard anything so presumably it's just

144
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,320
 taking longer than they thought. So two days ago um Chung Do announced on their Facebook page 114

145
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:36,640
 lucky emails have been sent we have now sent the emails to all of the finalists for final

146
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,600
 confirmation and the official list will be announced once all the finalists have confirmed by email.

147
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,560
 Chung Do is a shower we're recording a little pick up a little bit after we recorded because

148
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,600
 since we recorded the Hugo finalists were announced and then were unannounced again.

149
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,240
 I think announced is a strong word. They were not really announced were they they sort of

150
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,840
 they were they were put on the website in a kind of by somebody who clearly didn't think that anybody

151
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:11,200
 would ever check you know Chung Do Worldcon.com/Hugoes. I believe there's actually Hugo Heifen Award which

152
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:20,000
 is clearly very obvious. Is there any thoughts? Yeah I mean I can kind of see how it happened and

153
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,200
 I suspect that Chung Do are having to put more effort than many conventions into making sure

154
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:36,400
 their Hugo voting site is accessible from lots of different locations but I think just don't put

155
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,760
 the actual data in there to leave an empty awards. But apparently they were using they've been using

156
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,760
 fake data for weeks. The thing that happened was that people noticed when it changed to

157
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,240
 data which Tammy Coxen assures us is not correct. People who follow these things have

158
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,760
 pointed out numerous ways in which it cannot be correct because things are in wrong categories

159
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,440
 or there is double dipping in the best dramatic presentations. But why would you even like ever

160
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,280
 take a set of data which is wrong and put it in there instead of dummy data? I just yeah.

161
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,920
 It doesn't make any sense right? Because you hadn't noticed it was wrong at the point where

162
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,360
 you put it on and it took putting it on and having it around to cause people including people who

163
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,920
 should have known better to actually look at it and check it. No obviously then it was wrong

164
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,760
 because Tammy said this is the incorrect list like why did they get the list from the Hugo

165
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,760
 administrators in the first place if it was not the actual list? Yeah that's my question as well.

166
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,840
 Did they realize it was wrong until people pointed out it was wrong? Like did the Hugo team

167
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,560
 think to put the categories in alphabetical order for example? There's incompetence here

168
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,960
 from at least one group right? Either the Hugo administrator was incompetent because they

169
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,480
 let an incorrect list into the wild of the rest of the convention which should absolutely not have

170
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,000
 happened. It should have been the correct list and there should have been no list and then the

171
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,040
 correct list and they should not have been an intermediate stage and the web team were incompetent

172
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,400
 because on no account should you use real data when you're testing. Ever if you need representative

173
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,600
 data use the 2022 Hugo finalists which would be fine from the perspective of making sure like all

174
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,360
 your line wrapping is worked but we clearly not the actual ballot. These things do happen and I don't

175
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,240
 want to be mean but at the same time this should not have happened. Oh yeah no matter how many

176
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,720
 how much slack you are cutting the Shagdo team for having to do a very good difficult job in a

177
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,560
 very difficult year they absolutely should not have done this and the number of the number of

178
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:46,480
 lead so so when you're thinking about health and safety and risk management you have this model of

179
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,360
 the Swiss cheese where you have layers of protection none of which are perfect but the idea is that

180
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,840
 things don't get through because a lot of imperfect barriers is as good as a perfect one or it feels

181
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,240
 like you had to have made a cascade of stupid mistakes in order to have this happen in this way

182
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,080
 and they should have not have done that. It's a little bit annoying because when we posited a

183
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,800
 binary when we first recorded this episode of they will announce it or they won't announce it we

184
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:19,040
 didn't imagine the third option where they would do both. So sorry listeners we've let you down

185
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,920
 we've let ourselves down. Yeah and we're not going to talk about the people who we now expect to be

186
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,720
 on the ballot and are thrilled to see on the ballot that we shouldn't have seen but we are thrilled

187
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,040
 to see them all well done everyone. There are no Hugo finalists at the moment there are only past

188
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,560
 winners and that's finalists. So my favorite my favorite comment on this whole thing is the

189
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,320
 person who's busy saying oh so when we see the final list if there's anyone who wasn't on the

190
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,440
 redacted who was on the redacted list but isn't on the final list they are necessarily the people

191
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,440
 that the invidious forces of the Chinese government have deemed cannot be on the Hugo list and I thought

192
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,320
 that was amazing. Oh god I hadn't occurred to me until you just said it and now it has occurred to

193
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,960
 me and it makes me sad. I think it's very unlikely guys I don't think I don't think the Chinese

194
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,400
 government cares that much. Oh no I 100% agree with that but there will definitely be people who

195
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,840
 don't appear on the ballot because they'll have like recused or something and then we're gonna

196
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,520
 have a massive argument about whether that may or I just I'm not here for a listeners I can't be

197
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,760
 out. Yeah I mean well I listen so as did they only I'm going to give them not much benefit of

198
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,200
 the doubt but I don't think they can possibly realize that the list was not the correct list

199
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,760
 until they saw it on the website because it had dramatic presentations in both short and long form

200
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,920
 and we know that they always put them in one or the other category and that is a really easy thing

201
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,120
 that was the instant thing to spot. It's not like an edge case like did someone you know self you

202
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,160
 know self-publish their you know fiction on a tiny website in 2019 that makes them ineligible

203
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,520
 for astounding it's like a big thing. So my my personal theory is that it's just the top five in

204
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,960
 every category so top six in every category on the website before they do this kind of eligibility

205
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,160
 checking and so what I hope is that the only people who disappear are those who actually decline or

206
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,200
 are ineligible or are in two categories and then we only get new people. Are we very sad if there is

207
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,960
 anyone who is actually on the list and then gets taken off because it was a colossal error that would

208
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:34,160
 be a big shame. Especially if it's us. Anyway next segment.

209
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:41,440
 The Locust Award winners have been announced recently there are a whole load of them actually

210
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,800
 because they break down novel into multiple categories and they also award for short fiction

211
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,480
 and short story anthology and collection and magazine and so I'll link them in the show notes

212
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,000
 and you can go and read through them. I think the ones I would pull out are the winner of

213
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,440
 novelt is if you find yourself speaking to a dress god within formal you which I think was one of

214
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,400
 John and I's picks for best novelt for the Hugos. The winner of best short story was rabbit test

215
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,720
 by Samantha Mills which again was one of our picks and I don't think I've read any of the other

216
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,680
 winners actually so it's hard for me to pass comment on those but they do it like a solid list

217
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:29,600
 of stuff. I will say that Best Publisher winner was once again Tor. So I will also pull out that

218
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,200
 in the category of Best Publisher which was previously awarded under Best Book Publisher

219
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:44,000
 I think it has been Tor since about 1988 as far as I can tell although it has been split into

220
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,120
 it's been Best Publisher or Best Publisher Test imprint or Best Book Publisher at different times

221
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:56,960
 as far as I can tell they've all since 1988 gone to Tor so maybe I mean I'm not saying Tor out good

222
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,600
 but I am saying maybe it's time we thought about whether there are other publishers who may have

223
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,160
 published something good in the past 35 years. It is tricky to look at because I've looked up on the

224
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:15,280
 ISFDB and it's sort of split into five different awards at different times but it looks like

225
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,840
 previously it was mostly Valentine Delray and then passed seriously onto Tor or Tor,

226
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,080
 St Martin's and I think those are the only winners. Probably represents the you know the

227
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,680
 makeup of the voters and that they're probably predominantly American and probably do read a lot

228
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,360
 books from Tor but there's a number of you know British imprints on there in the the long list

229
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:47,440
 angry robot glance orbit and also small presses like Small Bit Press so yeah. Having said this I

230
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,920
 bet next year that we're not just going to be Tor.com instead. I said that. Oh do you think you have

231
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,320
 that much power over the locus fetus list? No I don't I think it will just be to spite me basically

232
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,280
 anyway the the the long list I think we mentioned the long list the long list do all look pretty good

233
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,200
 I've read some of the fiction of the short fiction lists while I was reading for the hugos and I

234
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,480
 liked pretty much all the ones on these lists I've read. So as always locus is the locus awards

235
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,640
 long list is quite a good survey of the fields and has loads of good stuff in it. It does and I suspect

236
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:30,160
 it's going to have some crossover with the Hugo nominations when we see those. Yes probably.

237
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:37,840
 Finalists. Finalists. There was a tempest in a teacup on a social network no one can get on

238
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,000
 where some people were unhappy that John Scalzi won for best science fiction novel and John Scalzi

239
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,120
 was unhappy that those people were unhappy and that went about as well as you'd expect. There

240
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,360
 is an interesting bit from the July 2023 issue of locus. Decide you preservation society by John

241
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,840
 Scalzi won with the smallest winning lead this year just 17 points ahead of the equality by Emily

242
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,800
 St. John Mandel which had the most votes and first place votes and would have won without the

243
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,320
 doubling of subscriber points and this is because if you are a locus subscriber your vote

244
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:19,600
 counts double in the locus awards so if you were annoyed by any of that it's all locus readers fault

245
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,160
 is that accurate is that is that the line we're taking is that good I think that's good

246
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,960
 dear's passionate I mean I didn't really follow the slap fight because I'm not on Twitter anymore

247
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,000
 I just hear about the snap slap fights third hand which is I gotta be honest much more fun

248
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,880
 it no one's on Twitter anymore it's true I tried clicking the link you put to the tweet in and it

249
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,560
 just said no error so I'm like okay this is good

250
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:58,080
 I am a member of the BSA and the BSA sent me their June 2023 newsletter I read in the newsletter

251
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,440
 that there are proposals for new awards categories which reflect the expanding communities of science

252
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:14,320
 fiction the BSA are connected with and then they are detailed in the minutes of the AGM now they say

253
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:21,600
 that these will be put out in more detail in the July newsletter so maybe there will be more detail

254
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,000
 then but as far as I can tell from the minutes there are going to be some new BSA awards and that's

255
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,080
 exciting so we're going to talk about it here so there is going to be a split they are splitting

256
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:42,400
 non-fiction into short non-fiction which is under 30,000 words or under 30 minutes and long non-fiction

257
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,240
 which is over 30,000 words or over 30 minutes and you will notice listeners that that has the word

258
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,080
 minutes in it as well as words and therefore I believe it means that podcasts such as ours will

259
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,280
 be officially eligible rather than under the radar eligible because I assume the intention is to

260
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,200
 encompass well and also it says non-fiction any platform which is the other key clue there will

261
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,960
 be we will be eligible again which is cool because long-time listeners might remember we were nominated

262
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,400
 in 2021 but we weren't nominated in 2022 and I suspect part of the reason was that we pointed

263
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,800
 out we were not technically eligible so so to try to try to what we we were nominated and we got

264
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,200
 a got into our gladrags and went along to the awards ceremony and a lot of people came up to us

265
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,720
 said you know that we've read the rules and you're not actually eligible which was true

266
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,320
 well no it wasn't people didn't come up to us they read the description of the award when they

267
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,760
 were awarding the awards and I noticed that the description did make it very clear it had to be

268
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,120
 written down which I just assumed that because we were nominated we were eligible but that is as

269
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,960
 it turns out bad assumption listeners don't make that assumption necessarily but anyway this is

270
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,800
 good I think and they're also introducing original audio fiction they're introducing best collection

271
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,080
 and they are splitting the short story I believe into novella and into short story although I am not

272
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:14,800
 100% clear about that so yes there's also I believe a new one for best translated work of short

273
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,320
 fiction but that's going to be a jury award not bs-fay award in the same style as the others

274
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,680
 did you mention the one for collections I did mention the one for collections and so this is

275
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:34,560
 all very interesting in a vacuum I think several very good ideas here my worry is participation in

276
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,520
 the bs-fay award is not always as high as one might ideally like it to be it's lower than you

277
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,040
 like it to be it's lower both at nomination stage which means that things sometimes get onto the

278
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,240
 final ballot with very small numbers of nominations and it's also lower than you'd like to be at

279
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,880
 finalist stage considering what a large member organization the bs-fay is and the fact that

280
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,840
 east econ members can also vote in the bs-fay awards it would be nice if there were more people

281
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,960
 I mean basically a lot of you guys out there are eligible to vote in these awards at both stages

282
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,400
 please do that it's good because broader participation is better so I should say I am the one of us who

283
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:19,920
 is not a bs-fay member at present do we get much detail on how many people actually voted

284
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:27,360
 or nominated no I'm relying on insider gossip here yeah so it is it is quite difficult to know and

285
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,400
 I think if I was at the AGM I might have wanted to have a bit more detail on that so I'd sort of know

286
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,320
 maybe I've been into this but I would want to kind of know how many people you've you got

287
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,680
 that seem to be part of your sort of active nominating body but you could also you could argue that

288
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,320
 the way to get more people engaged with your awards is to give them more categories of things they

289
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,040
 really care about and so maybe with more categories you will get a more engaged voting body so that

290
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,520
 that was like what I was going to come back to which is that's the counter argument I think is that if

291
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,480
 you recognize more categories that people care about you might find that there's an uptick it might be

292
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,920
 that this is the first step in doing that I would also say that this was based on a committee they

293
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,600
 did look at the viability of each of the things they proposed so presumably this has been discussed

294
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,560
 at some point I will also say and it's interesting because I hadn't read this until just now but

295
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,680
 one of the reasons stipulated in the report from the committee is that the reason this is happening

296
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:29,520
 now is because the award booklet is no longer being printed it's only going to be a PDF which

297
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,560
 means that expanding the award doesn't cost extra money for printing and I had not really thought

298
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:40,240
 of that as like a consideration but I guess that is that is another consideration happening here

299
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,040
 that's an interesting thing imagine if they got rid of all their other print publications

300
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,920
 well so yeah BSA awards interesting stuff I have a slight worry about that because although

301
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:59,440
 increasing the number of reward categories doesn't it doesn't cause them actual cash problems because

302
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,440
 of printing increasing the number of awards materially increases the amount of admin work

303
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,400
 and as we know from the Hugo Awards the the admin award for the the admin work for awards can become

304
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,160
 overwhelming yeah I'm I'm slightly surprised they did so many at once rather than kind of doing

305
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,280
 you know doing maybe doing these changes one at a time but maybe there's a

306
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,920
 I sense you're just doing them all at once and seeing how they go and then you can drop them if

307
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:34,240
 it turns out there is no appetite for particularly ones I said I could have sworn that the BSA

308
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,240
 had an award for best translation or best translation work that was a jury award but am I barking up

309
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,400
 totally the wrong tree was non-fictioned jury for a while someone who can like remember the 2010s

310
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,400
 please write it. Karen Mark you know everything about the history of the BSA

311
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,080
 A until they decide they didn't care about the history so please write it. Also anyone who can

312
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,800
 tell me why I can no longer remember the 2010s also please write. Oh it gets so much worse

313
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,160
 Liz you have no idea that was the BSA award

314
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:17,600
 I have a pick and somewhere I have some notes because normally when I pick books I have the books

315
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,440
 but the books are so heavy I was like I'm not taking them camping right so my pick this week is museum

316
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,400
 catalogs and in particular the museum catalogs of two of the museums I went to last two of the

317
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:37,200
 exhibitions I went to last year which were science fiction, voyage to the edge of imagination at the

318
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,680
 science museum and in the black fantastic at the Hayward Gallery and I think both of those got picked

319
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:50,320
 as picks on the podcast. Now museum catalogs used to just have pictures of everything that was in

320
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,240
 the museum and some text about the artist that more or less duplicated the material you could see

321
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,240
 in the exhibition but they have worked out that they can limit the amount of information in the

322
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,640
 exhibition and put it in museum catalogs instead for the nerds and charge a lot of money for these

323
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,560
 books so being me and a massive cheapskate I went to my library as soon as these books were published

324
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,560
 and said please get me copies of these books and now almost a year later I have them both at once

325
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:28,480
 so they are large very interesting hardbacks and they do they address the subject in two different

326
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,840
 ways so voyage to the edge of imagination um glim organ has collected contributions from a range

327
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,320
 of different academics to write chapters about the topic and this is illustrated with material

328
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,440
 about the exhibition as well so it does it would represent it would be a great souvenir of the

329
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,680
 exhibition if you wanted to keep these sorts of things in your house which I don't um and that's

330
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,600
 kind of explore the themes of the exhibition in more depth through a variety of different perspectives

331
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:10,720
 and in the black fantastic has the author echoation actually going into more depth on the topic and

332
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,840
 the themes of the exhibition but pulling in some contributions from other people but not with the

333
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,480
 sense of it being an academic work in chapters in quite the same way I think the thing that struck

334
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:28,240
 me most about this is that several of the reviews of voyage to the edge of the imagination have

335
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,440
 suggested that the edge of the imagination of what is essentially odd visual science fiction

336
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,520
 of the last 50 years we're not actually all that imaginative that the edge of the imagination

337
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,200
 is not that far away because of the limits of human imagination and then you look at it in the

338
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:55,680
 black fantastic where echelon is playing with essentially the whole of black culture not merely

339
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:04,960
 afrofuturism but also lots of different sorts of um black art and um and the whole of the myth of

340
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:12,160
 all of the african peoples which is an enormous range of culture and has and of course it's

341
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:20,080
 it's massively more imaginative than the relatively narrow um robots and spaceship stuff that is

342
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,400
 it there's most of the stuff of science fiction edge of the imagination these are two very good

343
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,640
 books and I recommend them both and both books made me think again about what I've seen in their

344
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,160
 relative exhibitions and think about what they were telling me in different ways and I'd strongly

345
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,480
 recommend them and you can get them from your library by pushing your name down and waiting

346
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:46,240
 for a very long time. I'm going next so my pick is a book I read basically in one sitting while on

347
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:53,680
 my uh some holidays it is a novella called Stealing for the Sky by Adam Roberts which

348
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,080
 it seemed to sort of sneak out I mean Adam Roberts writes a lot of kind of well regarded science

349
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:03,360
 fiction novels many of which have ended up on award shortlist and Silling for the Sky I think

350
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,760
 is by a different press than his novels come out and it just sort of like snuck out it seems and

351
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,080
 it's it's quite enjoyable all the reviews say is in the style of Donald Westlake and all that I

352
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:22,000
 have never read but it's basically like one of these sort of it's sort of a science fiction thriller

353
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,840
 with a kind of very a very violent and gory edge I mean if anyone who is planning to read this does

354
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:34,080
 not like kind of a protagonist who is not afraid to deal out a lot of violence in the cause of

355
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:39,440
 doing the um fevery that he does but it seems it's quite entertaining and it ends up with him

356
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,560
 basically stealing a mystery device kind of in the course of another like high steers pulling

357
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:52,560
 um which has some really odd momentum effects and then he ends up he mostly still satellites and

358
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,240
 he steals a strange orb and then he ends up getting chased by the authorities chased by Russians

359
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,040
 going out to try and heist an obsolete rocket in the middle of the Russian winter and it's just

360
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,400
 quite a fun kind of techno thriller near future you know in the the protagonist whose name is

361
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,080
 Starman slightly unbelievably but it's his nickname is um essentially stealing things to try and get

362
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,600
 enough money to go into space and probably get away from people so it's it's it's quite short I mean

363
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,720
 it's a novella I don't think it's going to win any awards but I did find it kind of an entertaining

364
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:34,560
 thing to read while I was in transit because it's quite pacy and keeps your keeps your attention

365
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,320
 nice I had a moment of cognitive dissonance because you said Donald Westlake and I was like

366
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,880
 what isn't that the chair of the Wussfuss mark protection committee but that's Donald Eastlake

367
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,800
 yeah wrong one so uh completely different lake Adam Roberts is one of the authors that I do

368
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:00,560
 keep dipping into because he does normally write quite chewy stuff that is trying to expand my

369
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,080
 horizons I mean he doesn't necessarily always succeed and it does sound like you've just described

370
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:12,720
 a Adam Roberts novella which is just kind of cheerily pacy and entertaining and I'm sure it's

371
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,320
 the same Adam Roberts so one thing I would say is that I read quite a lot of Adam Roberts I haven't

372
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:25,120
 read all of his work but you know I've probably read at least 10 probably more of his novels but

373
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,440
 I do think he you know there there is some kind of common ground to them but I don't think he writes

374
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,680
 the same book twice yeah no I'd agree with that which you know I applaud him for even when it's one

375
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,640
 that doesn't quite work for me I do applaud him for what he's doing I would say this one has some

376
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,520
 commonalities with yellow blue tibia because he goes back to the sort of it's in Russia and

377
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:53,040
 there's always sort of the slightly slightly comedically done Russian accent kind of thing of like dour

378
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,360
 Russian heavies so there's that in it but I think because it's so short and because it's basically

379
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:06,800
 kind of pretty tight perspective on this warm hardball protagonist who is just going around doing

380
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,880
 kind of a couple of heists and that's basically the whole thing I think it does manage to be quite

381
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,880
 pacy maybe pacy than a lot of his regular novels but I mean I went into it I think I picked it up

382
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,120
 picked up of Amazon because it's very cheap on Amazon like I think it was under a quid and so I

383
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,760
 thought well I'll give it a go and I didn't really have many expectations for it because I hadn't read

384
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:34,480
 any of the comparator things and yeah I just found it to be a good little you know two-hour diversion

385
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,040
 Adam Roberts is one of the people who I would be absolutely delighted to see on next year's hugo

386
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,440
 ballot when um the Worldconners in the UK so we might get more British stuff on the ballot

387
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,760
 so therefore write some good things in 2022 Adam what is this book eligible no this is a

388
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:01,280
 it's a 2022 book oh boo so you need so he needs to write a 2023 one get your skates on Adam I honestly

389
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,960
 don't expect Adam Roberts to end up on the Hugo shortlist I mean he's been on the BSA

390
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,480
 shortlist but I don't know if these books kind of have enough mass appeal to get on the Hugo

391
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,040
 shortlist I think they are one thing always very different for each other they are sometimes

392
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,760
 quite difficult reads quite philosophical and maybe they've never quite passed that threshold

393
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,880
 of being on the Hugo ballot I also don't know if he has a high readership in the US whereas for

394
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,320
 instance I know let's say Adrian Tricowski now has like a US publisher and gets more attention in the

395
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,880
 US and that might be part of why he's starting to turn upon on Hugo ballots but like you say 2024

396
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,120
 is going to be 2024 is going to be an incredibly odd year for Hugo nominations because it's going

397
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:50,480
 to be anyone who joined to vote in 2023 which could be a lot it could be and we'll see the Chinese

398
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,440
 influence on there which may be persistent at 2024 plus a whole load more Europeans than you might

399
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,280
 have had for the past few years plus the Americans who are still joining to come to Glasgow or just

400
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,280
 to have voting and nomination rights could be really odd next year I look forward to it

401
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,600
 I'm going to pick I'm going to not pick something and then I'm going to do my pick

402
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,840
 so I'm not going to pick every clerk award finalist that as I read them because I think that would

403
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,520
 get tedious for everyone but I have just finished reading Venomous Lumpsucker by Ned Bowman which

404
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,080
 I've put in my Goodreads review that it felt to me like in some places the Ministry for the

405
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,400
 Future by Kim Stanley Robertson but in other places it felt like Ready Player One by Ernest Cline

406
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,600
 and it really distresses me that like I can see how this book could have been amazing

407
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,200
 but there is just so many bits where it isn't and there was one bit where I did a full body

408
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:54,080
 eye roll which I didn't know I was capable of oh could you can you do want to demonstrate what

409
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:01,360
 a full body eye roll looks like John for the for the audio podcast it's like ah it's like

410
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:09,200
 some of it's very insightful and interesting and some of it is extremely crude and uninsightful

411
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:17,600
 and sort of very unfunny and unwitty you know in a part of it feel very incisive and cutting and

412
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:25,200
 part of it feels zany in a bad way and I found that incredibly frustrating. Can I just check

413
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,840
 is it the bits that were like Kim Stanley Robinson that were the insightful ones and the bits that

414
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:36,000
 were unfunny and forced like Ready Player One by any chance? You have successfully you have

415
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,920
 successfully grasped the key yeah it's tricky I do wonder whether someone more grounded in the

416
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,000
 genre would have avoided some of the zanniness but I don't know whether that's fair I don't know

417
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,360
 whether that's fair or not really because I get the impression this comes from the literary angle

418
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:58,800
 as did the anomaly but yes I didn't hate it but I and I wanted to like it more than I ended up

419
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,520
 liking it which was a frustrating experience. Does it at any point have chapters where we just

420
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,640
 like list a whole bunch of shit? There's a lot of info dumping and there's a lot of I'm very clever

421
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,520
 and have worked out the I'm going to tell you things in the guise of what are the characters now

422
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,040
 which is yeah in that same kind of way that Ready Player One does. This is of course not my pick

423
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:28,800
 I'm just explaining why it's not my pick for the for the listener. My actual pick is

424
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,160
 Across the Spider-Verse which I went to see with friends of the

425
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,280
 Friends of the Pod Neil Harrison and Nick Clark in the Jamdrah Cinema in Willie Bay which

426
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:48,640
 lovely little cinema and it's very good it is interesting I believe it is spoiler half a movie

427
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,920
 yeah but I don't mind that I mean it became very clear it was half a movie when I looked at my

428
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,240
 watch and I was like well it feels like we're about at the end of act two and we have been in the

429
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,000
 cinema for over two hours and I do not understand how they could do a compelling act three in the

430
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,480
 next sort of 20 minutes and then there was a 2B continued and I was like oh yes that makes sense

431
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,880
 in the in the sense of what I know about the structures of movies. I don't think this is a

432
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,720
 problem at all if you know it's happening. I didn't know it was happening and I wasn't bothered

433
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,880
 and you know I've seen lots of good movies in the cinema where well I really like the first

434
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,120
 half of June but I went into that clear-eyed believing I was getting the first half of June

435
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,680
 I think if I'd gone into the cinema believing I was seeing the entire plot I would have been

436
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,640
 pretty pissed off because it really it really just does film the first half of the thing.

437
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,200
 Dune didn't market itself as a part one right all of the posters just said Dune.

438
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,640
 I think if you were paying attention to Dune you knew Dune was part one of a two-part story

439
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,400
 and if you're paying attention to this you probably know the same but both movies have not

440
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,800
 marketed themselves as part one which it like you know is not great but I've noticed a lot of

441
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:04,400
 people talking about this in ways that I think are slightly okay so people have been

442
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,640
 commending the art style which I think is great and obviously the first one did a lot in terms

443
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,440
 of animation techniques which was very fresh. One of the things that's been repeatedly kind of

444
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,920
 praised is the art style of Spider Gwen's universe and it's slightly frustrating because no one is

445
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,480
 discussing that. Everyone is discussing that as if that was something the film did and that is

446
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,080
 just straight from the comics and that is something the comics have been doing since Spider Gwen was

447
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,080
 a character in the comic so like I do find it slightly frustrating that a lot of people are

448
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,200
 giving Miller and Lord the Crayard it for that in a way that I think is weird because I think it

449
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,360
 betrays a lack of knowledge of the source material. Not unusual for comic adaptations in movies.

450
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,800
 No no probably not. It's very common for things that are straight out of the comics to be

451
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,040
 hailed as as fresh and innovative in movies because one of the things that you could do in comics is

452
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,920
 explore cinematographic styles at low cost. Much lower cost than making movies which is an

453
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:10,000
 expensive thing to do. Yes in general I think the pacing is weird in the start because it starts

454
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,440
 by telling Spider Gwen's story and then kind of cuts to the title sequence and takes us back to

455
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,480
 Miles probably about 20 minutes in which is quite a long time to basically do an act zero and that

456
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,840
 was it didn't feel the structure is slightly weird as a result and I'm glad they did that but

457
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,280
 certainly at the beginning I was a bit like this is not quite as well paced as the original which is

458
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,800
 probably about as perfect as you could structure a movie but when it gets into things it's really

459
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:47,200
 good and I also find it interesting that they don't use the characters from the original movie as

460
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,640
 prominently as they might have done. Like obviously Gwen's in it a lot of Miles's in it a lot but

461
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,080
 the other characters are like not featured as much which I was a bit surprised by by assuming that

462
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:04,560
 they will come back in the third installment but in general I really liked it and I think it does

463
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,800
 a good job of doing something a bit different with the series than you might otherwise have done

464
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,080
 and also I really like how enthusiastically they've embraced the complete lunacy of the

465
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,720
 Spider-verse because like they were just growing stuff in the film and I was like I cannot believe

466
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,120
 that they are putting all of this in the movie because it doesn't really be kind of hard to

467
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,760
 work out what's going on in the comics and there you can reread the page but this is like the web

468
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,880
 of destiny and you're like oh my god it's all here which is fabulous but kind of mad.

469
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,200
 That was true the first one though. Oh but the second one have you seen the second one?

470
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:50,240
 No should I? No so the second one rams it up to like 11 or 12 I think. They fully embrace well

471
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,640
 because I think the first one the first one does have like the multiverse stuff in but it doesn't

472
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,880
 go anywhere near as much into like the mysticism behind it that's in the comics and the second one

473
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:08,160
 I feel like is starting to touch on all that more and I think is kind of I like it a lot but I'm not

474
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,320
 necessarily I don't think I would have guessed that that was the way they were going to go.

475
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,120
 Maybe that's the best way to put it. So yeah. It sounds great. I liked it a great deal I would

476
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,120
 highly recommend seeing it in the cinema even though it is a part one. For most of the

477
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,080
 reason I regret not seeing Dune in the cinema despite it being a part one although Dune I didn't

478
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,680
 go and see not because it was a part one but because it was too long however rule about

479
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:38,000
 long movies. Well that was the Hold To Thought podcast and it's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me.

480
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,080
 It's goodbye from me and somehow while we were doing that every Lebanese restaurant on my

481
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:55,760
 delivery app has gone offline. Probably because it rained while we were doing podcasts.

482
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:12,640
 I think we're getting through it. I think we've got some stuff here this is good.

483
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,760
 I think we're done apart from pics aren't we? Probably that out of a pic.

484
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,120
 Yeah you do you've got a pic Liz. Search your feelings you know it to be true.

485
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:27,680
 I did watch Rogue One. Pick, pick the beach. I've been to the beach. You went to the beach last time

486
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,760
 we recorded right? Yeah I mean I'm not gonna pick like Indonesia it's my pic. That is very nice.

487
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,160
 Let me see what books I've read someone else go first. Why what's wrong with picking Indonesia?

488
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,160
 Is it very nice should we go? I'm not going to pick a country for a pic. It's not science fictional.

489
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,680
 You can because it's the summer of fun. Well we're going to pick the summer of fun then I'm

490
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,000
 picking sport and you probably don't want that. Oh do it do it. You need all sport or a specific

491
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,440
 sport. No specific sport. No I've got something it's all right. Pick a sport pick a sport pick a sport.

492
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,000
 No we're good I've got a book. Pick a sport that's not cricket because I feel like we should have

493
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,200
 equal representation for other sports that are played in summer. Well I feel this is like

494
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,680
 just escalating the off topic cricket mentions of the pod. The theme music for this episode was
