00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hello listeners, it's John here. I just want to let you know that Liz's microphone sounds very

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,440
 slightly different in this episode. We need to get on because Liz is starting to make

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,920
 I need to get to bed soon because I've got another club meeting noises.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,640
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 57th episode of Octa Thorpe, which is coming to you on the 12th

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,560
 of May 2022. I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Bassie.

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:46,080
 And we are recording our first episode after Eastercon, but before we get to Eastercon,

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,960
 we have some letters of comment. So we had a letter from Malcolm Hutchison that said that in the

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,400
 episode before last, the sound I made at the start of the episode made him visualise me as a

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:07,200
 muppet in a good way, which is nice. Well, there's the chapter art. Oh yes, I'm well up for that.

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,800
 Well, it may need to be all three of us as muppets, so that might be a bit hard.

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,320
 Can my muppet have a glittery octa-thorpe on its forehead? Yeah, I should think so.

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,600
 Thank you very much to Meg MacDonald, who did a letter of comment in the form of a

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,600
 glyph on my skin, which is the first time we've had a letter of comment on that medium. So thank you

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,280
 very much Meg. She also decorated me. Chris Garcia sent us a letter saying, "I don't like live

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,160
 episode usually, but this one is really good because it's y'all." And I don't know if I could say y'all.

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,240
 Is it y'all? And y'all didn't try making it into a live show, any different from the regular show.

17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,280
 Maybe that's not normal. So I think that's a compliment, but basically when we're live,

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,400
 apparently we sound exactly like when we're not live, which is... Well, no, I think when we're

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,880
 not live, we sometimes do have show notes and preparation. So thank you Chris for that.

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,240
 He also says that streaky bacon is the only true bacon, which is another example of when Chris is

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,360
 wrong about things. Yeah, it's sad, isn't it? It's just, I'm much prefer what he's right about

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:21,040
 things. He still hasn't told me which author wrote me. Oh yeah. I'm still waiting Chris. Sorry Chris is

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,080
 right about streaky bacon. No. Certainly not right about British streaky bacon. American streaky

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,720
 bacon is very nice. No, it's not American streak. Americans don't understand how to do streaky

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,560
 bacon. In fact Americans don't understand how to do bacon, but British streaky bacon. No, American

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,520
 bacon is better than British streaky bacon. 100%. Because? Because it's crispy and nice,

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,800
 as opposed to sort of limp and sad. No, it's crispy if you cook it properly in Britain. This is a

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,080
 matter of how you fry it, right? Get good bacon from a good butcher, fry it. Sticky bacon turns into

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,080
 the most marvelous thing, and then you eat it on bomb cakes with brown sauce. It's bad you won't

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,680
 eat bacon in the UK because she fundamentally thinks that our streaky bent bacon is complete crap,

31
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,920
 and she just waits to go back. You need to get a decent bacon. Get better bacon. We've had it from

32
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,680
 a decent butcher. It's not a problem with butchers. It's not a problem with provenance. It's a problem

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,160
 with our country, Alison, our country. So problem with the pigs? I don't know, maybe streaky bacon in

34
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,000
 the UK is not quite the same as American bacon. I think it's the problem. No, no, it's a different

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
 cut of bacon. But streaky bacon is the best bacon because fundamentally, fundamentally,

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,280
 I just like lard. Sticky bacon has its own lard in it, right? So it literally cooks itself in lard.

37
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,800
 Backbacon's better. You're overruled. Yeah, I'm a john. No, so wrong. Official opinion of the

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,840
 Oct thought podcast by majority vote that backbacon is best, and that's going to be the episode title,

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,040
 and you can't stop me. Boom. I love nobody likes middle. Maybe in hindsight, listening to all the

40
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:19,040
 bacon chat is a good thing. We did not actually sit down and have breakfast together at East

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:29,200
 Oh, Chris also wrote to us with a lock on the previous episode. He says the fan awards and

42
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,360
 coffee was late shows how much are outside of fanzine fandom he is at the moment. He still does

43
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,640
 scenes, but he's not quite a part of the core flu community, which he finds kind of sad because

44
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,600
 he loves scenes and a bunch of the stuff the core flu regulars do. And that kind of ties into

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,840
 stuff we were saying in that episode. And that is interesting because I think Chris is one of the

46
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,400
 fairly prolific old school fanzine editors. Roman wrote to us on Easter Sunday when we

47
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,000
 were scoffing chocolate catching COVID and preparing for our live show to send us greetings from the

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,560
 Easter bill be, for which we're very grateful because we do not have Easter bill be's in Britain

49
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,720
 or Thailand. I have a question about what is an Easter bill we well, it's a bill be at Easter.

50
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,600
 So a fundamental question here is an adorable Australian animal which I've already drawn.

51
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
 So I'm going to try and draw the bill be muppet now.

52
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,760
 Excellent stuff. Thank you Roman. Oh they're cute. Sorry I look but you don't know,

53
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,920
 bill be's are very cute. I looked at bill be's they've got adorable giant ears.

54
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,440
 They have adorable giant ears and also glasses at a silly beard.

55
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,840
 Oh yeah that is a daft looking animal. It really is yeah. So it looks like I don't know what it

56
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:53,200
 looks like. John the bill be muppet. Oh that's my art task for the week isn't it? Yes.

57
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,120
 We have one more lock which was from Jersey Griffin who says that the Hello Internet podcast

58
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,960
 did a vinyl episode before jumping the shark and doing a four to five minute wax cylinder episode

59
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,120
 and that is interesting. I'll try and find a link and pop it in the show notes.

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,760
 Oh a four to five minute wax cylinder episode. Sorry I thought you said a 45 minute wax

61
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,400
 cylinder episode. Now it's like it's a lot of wax. What was the wax cylinder episode?

62
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,560
 Someone else did a wax cylinder episode that we have been alerted to by one of our listeners

63
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,760
 as well as false light.

64
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:37,440
 Well we all have fun at EasterCon. Obviously we talked about our impressions of EasterCon last

65
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,360
 week but this time we're going to talk about what happened after EasterCon which is that quite

66
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,360
 a lot of people went home and discovered that they are caught COVID at the convention including

67
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,080
 me. I'm all better now thank you very much. That's the bit you could edit the coffin to John.

68
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,000
 Let's help you another one along in a minute. What buses? It's interesting because the west

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,520
 con happened the same weekend with the identical COVID policy to EasterCon and did not have very

70
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,160
 many cases possibly because there was much COVID in the area but also possibly because

71
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,040
 people at North Westcon behaved slightly differently than people at EasterCon.

72
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,440
 I went around the convention. I mean I mostly did follow the conventions COVID policy and I

73
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,720
 masked up except when I was eating and drinking in bars. How much time did I spend eating and

74
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:35,200
 drinking in bars? I mean a lot. Until 7 a.m. on the only 6.30 and I didn't spend all of that time

75
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,880
 in a bar. I spent so that time in a corridor and I didn't spend all of that time. I just

76
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,280
 spend all of that time on masks. One of the things that España said on the way home was that if we do

77
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,920
 because España stayed up late on the Sunday night and we both agreed that in future conventions

78
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:02,800
 we might go to bed sort of 1 a.m.ish on purpose because the masking dropped noticeably after

79
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,840
 about midnight every night that I stayed up that late and that's like a mixture of things like

80
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,040
 people up that late are generally drinking but also like as you get drunker your ability to

81
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,280
 remember to put your mask on between so it's a bit of a decrease and so I think the convention

82
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,840
 got riskier after midnight than it was before would be my guess. Conventions are normally

83
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,040
 riskier after the midnight. I'm not sure I would pick that at midnight. What I would say is during

84
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,760
 the daytime when people were in panels or in the dealers room or even in the games room they seem

85
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,000
 to be mostly masked. Of course there were exceptions for people with medical exemptions. People on

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,160
 panels often were not wearing masks because of the need to read and there were a few notable

87
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,160
 exceptions of people I saw like in panels who seemed to be slowly sipping a drink for the whole

88
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,800
 hour and I get made and recently cranky by this and I saw you and I know who you are but let's

89
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,920
 move on. But then basically what happens is you know the program the program dies down people start

90
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,000
 going out to dinner or go out to dinner and then come back and sit in the bar and then you're

91
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 drinking and you're fairly continuously drinking from your pint of beer or your glass of wine or

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,200
 eating your pizza and you tend not to put your masks back on and then basically you end up with

93
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,680
 a large room either in this case the the real L bar or the hotel bar which is full of people who

94
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,520
 are not really masked and then you know I was I put mine back on for things like you know making a

95
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,960
 quick trip to loo or going to the bar to buy another drink but fundamentally I'm spending a lot

96
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,360
 of that time without a mask on and I think that's my guess is that's where quite a lot of the transmission

97
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,840
 occurred and the later it got the less people had masks on but also the later it got I think

98
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,720
 you know once you get past one or two a.m. there's a lot fewer people still around so that probably

99
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,840
 does help a bit yeah I mean I'm not sure that the actual number of people in the bar after 1 a.m.

100
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,760
 was the problem here though it's certainly true that the people who were up late were more likely

101
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,720
 to be people who catch COVID but they're probably more sociable people generally I wanted to single

102
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,720
 out two events that were not just hanging out in the bar the first was a disco which was a program

103
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,560
 item and the COVID policy was completely clear that if you're in the disco and dancing you should

104
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,280
 have been wearing masks and as far as I could tell from the many many photos of people singing along

105
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,280
 in the disco and having a great time nobody in the disco wore a mask and that's probably an extremely

106
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,720
 spready sort of an event and the other event I want to single out was the voxel party which obviously

107
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,880
 was not a good official program item but was in the same room that we had Octa thought live in which

108
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,080
 was one of the less well ventilated rooms in the convention and it was quite crowded and obviously

109
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,880
 a lot of drinking was people were actively drinking and obviously if you were actively drinking you

110
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,560
 do not have to wear a mask because you know active drinking is what we do and I think that was probably

111
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,800
 quite a spready event but you can't tell. I shown a categorizable what I said about my

112
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,680
 Eastcon experience as one woman super spreader event Alice and Scott has absolutely no regrets

113
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,720
 and I don't on my account and I'm catching it and I've not been very sick but I you know I have a

114
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,600
 friend who spent an art in hospital and I have another friend who went home to with COVID to be

115
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 the sole carer for her her aged parents so I think there's cases like that where you do have to go

116
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,800
 well maybe we should be a little bit more careful and see if we can't reduce the transmission further.

117
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,320
 Yeah it was it was definitely not great I think we ended up you know the number of reports

118
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,760
 suggest about 10% of the convention reports at a positive test in the kind of 10 days at the

119
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,600
 convention or in the sort of 10 days following it which is I would say pretty high and you know

120
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,280
 still higher than I think than things like Novocarne which we thought had quite a few cases last year

121
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,040
 and definitely much higher than NorwestCon. So there are things you could do but I struggled

122
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,240
 to find ways that you could do things that aren't fundamentally you shouldn't all sit in the real

123
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,040
 little bar or in a path you're in a disco with your masks off for five hours and it feels like

124
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,120
 everyone was sort of willing to if you're looking in those spaces I presume you're willing to kind

125
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,840
 of take the risk of being in those on mass spaces because they enjoyed chatting and drinking with

126
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,360
 people. I did actually circulate in bars less than I normally would and I don't know whether that was

127
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:31,040
 a deliberate thing or accidental but I spent the number of people I actually spent a lot of time

128
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,720
 chatting to is it was much smaller than it might have been at the average EastCon.

129
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,600
 I had kind of a couple of long conversations each night rather than Melly.

130
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,800
 Yeah I think I probably kind of flitted about from group to group less although I think I do that

131
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,160
 less than Allison anyway and definitely there's one night where we sort of sat in a corridor

132
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,720
 and around a corridor away from the real elbow rather than sitting in the real elbow all that

133
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,400
 was wanted to do with the availability of chairs. Oh that's my favourite space in the park in

134
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,400
 for sitting and chatting. Is that little bit round the corner from the real elbow?

135
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,200
 I mean obviously if I tell everyone then everyone will want it.

136
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:15,680
 Yes, sorry but I definitely think not getting covid was a case of I was very recently vaccinated.

137
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,840
 I was quite diligent about mask wearing and I wore quite a good mask and I just was lucky not to

138
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,760
 catch it when the people I had prolonged on mass conversations with. I definitely had prolonged

139
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,560
 mass conversations with people who were positive at the time but I guess we won't know for sure.

140
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,280
 I put in the show notes. Turns out beer sharing is not as dodgy as all that and this is quick to

141
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,440
 be up on that. Well I mean yeah there are photos of obviously me, John and Allison sharing one beer

142
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,000
 on the Upstalk Live at EastCon at a time when unknown to us all Allison had probably got covid

143
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,480
 and we seemed to have escaped and that she didn't pass it on to me or John. But I mean I think there

144
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,640
 were at least three or four people in that room who probably had covid at the time. So...

145
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,080
 It seems likely right like given that 10% of people tested positive after the event if you

146
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,320
 assume that was proportionate in all of the panel items and there were about 40 people in the room

147
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,160
 I would have expected of three or four. Obviously like I'm not an expert but Liz is an expert and

148
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,880
 she just said it and I'm agreeing with her so I'm definitely right. I really wanted to

149
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,040
 Liz to read out the thing she said of the show notes which I thought was very funny.

150
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,240
 I mean I buy that I mean that specifically I noticed three or four people in the room who then

151
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,120
 reported positive tests so I'm not basing it on any mathematical thing I'm saying oh those three

152
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,240
 people who are my mates who I saw were then like oh I'm positive. No no it was it was the thing

153
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,040
 where you were like I was like beer sharing is that dodgy and you were like not compared to

154
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:52,080
 turning your head to spray aerosols on your canvas. Yes so we also discovered at OptiThult Live

155
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,880
 that one thing that Alison cannot refrain from doing on panels is turning her head to look at a

156
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,120
 fellow panelist even when that means taking her mouth well away from the microphone which I thought

157
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,880
 was a major problem at the time but it turns out that may you know pale and it's significant

158
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,080
 compared to fact that Alison was therefore stewing aerosols directly and being John for an hour.

159
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,400
 But we had both taken the sensible precaution of topping up our antibodies pre-esticon.

160
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:29,280
 Liz with a jab from Thailand and me from getting Covid from movers and so you know one of those is

161
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,920
 a more sensible approach than the other I think but it did stand a thing good stead for the

162
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,560
 convention. I mean Mark and I so when Mark Plummer came down with Covid he sent me a text saying

163
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,160
 you know at least this is well timed for e-sticon and I did it was one of the things that I thought

164
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,640
 when I got out I was like oh thank goodness it means I'm very unlikely to come down with it on my

165
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,400
 holiday to Spain and my trip to Eastcon and that so it so it turned out to be.

166
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,720
 Yeah I think we both took the more readily available way of getting antibodies in our

167
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,960
 countries at the respective times yeah. Yeah so probably I should have gone for a few part

168
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,880
 to a few parties a month before Easticon or hung out with Mark Plummer more.

169
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,760
 Just move house Alison. So the other thing I wanted to pick up is that I've heard some people

170
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,640
 saying well you know actually a lot of a lot of people took a calculated risk here they knew what

171
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,800
 they were doing they knew what they were getting into and a lot of people have reminded us of the

172
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,520
 Chester Easticon which is about the same size as this one where about the third of the convention

173
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,840
 came down with Noravirus afterwards and I have to say my experience of Covid has not been as bad

174
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,960
 as many people's I didn't catch Noravirus or that occasion but many periods people's experience

175
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,880
 of post Eastcon Noravirus so if I if there hadn't been a pandemic going on I wouldn't have

176
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,440
 noticed this this illness as being anything untoward. I mean I've never had Noravirus so it's a difficult

177
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,720
 craving. Do not recommend it. I think Chester was slightly smaller by I take your point.

178
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:09,600
 Do we want to talk about Noravirus-Con's case three and case five? Yes so I was first

179
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,440
 alerted to this by a tweet from Shonna Maguire but Noravirus-Con published you know their own case reports

180
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,840
 of people who reported Covid positive tests after Noravirus-Con on their website and it turned out by

181
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,560
 positive tests after the con they also mean positive tests at the con or before the con and in

182
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,440
 at least two cases positive tests after before the con and symptoms and continuing to go to the

183
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:40,160
 convention. So yeah I'm just sort of I just look at it and I'm staggered like even if you did that

184
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,440
 why would you then go report it? I guess your conscience doesn't prick you that maybe oh I have

185
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,680
 Covid I shouldn't go into it in the games room but it does prick you that you should then tell people

186
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,880
 later on that you're in the games room with Covid? Yeah it's just I can't get my head around the mindset.

187
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:02,400
 So I am fairly certain that there were people in this position at Eastrecon. I don't have names

188
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,400
 or other things this isn't like I so is so but I think that we almost certainly in a convention of

189
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,120
 600 odd people had people who knew perfectly well they got Covid and were keeping their mouth shut

190
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:22,640
 about it and go to the convention anyway. And those people are absolute rotters and I think they

191
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,240
 should sod off. I'm abandoning all balance or pretense of diplomacy if you are one of these

192
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,440
 people stop listening delete the podcast I don't like you. No no no carry on listening if you're

193
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,080
 all these listeners right in so we could roundly mock you. I think it's reasonable to assume that

194
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,400
 there were there was a lot of infection around but you know we didn't need a lot of infection there

195
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,160
 were plenty of people who tested positive during the convention and there's plenty of time at

196
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,160
 least to come to spread the infection and we are one community everyone socialises with everyone

197
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,040
 else. I also don't know because obviously the other thing with Eastrecon is that we were not

198
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:08,000
 the hotel we used Eastrecon is also a hotel used by a lot of people who fly with airlines and so

199
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,960
 it might also be the case that like even if everyone even if Alison is wrong and no one at the

200
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,920
 Eastrecon was attending suspecting they had covid you know there were vectors probably.

201
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:28,160
 There were a lot of sick people in the in the breakfast room on Friday morning I think not going

202
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,360
 if you're thinking about things you simple things you could do to reduce your risk at Eastrecon

203
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,160
 travelling on the Friday is probably one of them because because there were a lot of non-fans in

204
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,840
 the hotel on the Thursday night and obviously those people weren't following the convention's

205
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,600
 mass policy at breakfast. Although I will say the masking at Eastrecon was better than the masking

206
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,480
 at the hotel Liz and I stayed at when we visited Reading with Alison last summer because my god

207
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,280
 that was more crowded and less masks and that was I mean that was in summer so I guess the cases

208
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,200
 were lower then but I will say Eastrecon did a pretty good job of the Eastrecon was better than

209
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,320
 other hotel breakfast so I have been to lately so that is good well done Eastrecon committee

210
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,480
 and I think in general the Eastrecon committee should be applauded I think they did about as

211
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,720
 good a job as they possibly could have done maybe with the exception of better enforcement in the

212
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,200
 disco what do you what do you two think is that reasonable statement do we reckon?

213
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,880
 Yeah I mean I think you could have been stricter you could you could say something like okay

214
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,440
 the real Elba or some social spaces are designated like eating and drinking spaces and in other

215
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,520
 places you must remain masked except for you know to take a sip of your water or something so

216
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,080
 basically try and encourage people not to take points into panels and sit there slowly sipping

217
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,120
 them and things like that and then in a way it would let attendees choose if they go into the

218
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:00,400
 social spaces or not but it is difficult because if they said okay you know real Elba we want you

219
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,080
 to try and mask up between sips and make sure you mask when you are moving around and mask when

220
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,080
 you are going to the bar there is still the hotel bar which is not a convention space and so they

221
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,880
 cannot really enforce people masking there particularly as there were non-convention guests in the hotel

222
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,160
 bar you know acting in you know in complete accordance with the you know the current state of

223
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,960
 things in the UK which is that people don't habitually wear masks at all so yeah I think there are

224
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,120
 you know there are possibly a few things you could have done but it would have been quite

225
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,120
 difficult to actually practically implement those the convention was also under volunteered

226
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,720
 and one of the consequences of that was especially during setup when volunteers were working very

227
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,720
 very hard there was a lot of not being masked whilst getting the work done going on and I think

228
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,120
 if you had a convention where you had enough volunteers including enough volunteers to

229
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,080
 account for people who came down with covid um you could say but we are going to require you to

230
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,280
 mask while working um in setup we're not going to actually allow you to have pockets where you go

231
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,680
 well we're working on the convention in this space and you're not masking and I think we could have

232
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:12,080
 done that and I think we could have done better because for program items the rule was you can

233
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,360
 bring a drink in but you have to just raise your mask have a sim remask not everybody was doing

234
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,000
 that and I think we could have policed that sort of thing I don't know and I will say sorry tip

235
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,840
 button before lizards had a turn but I will say one of the other things is banyan I said on the

236
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,560
 train home was a few drink of edges I do wonder whether there needs to be a rule around you

237
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,280
 not allowed to be drinking panels because as much as that would be slightly annoying I do wonder

238
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,880
 whether the bonus would be worth it I mean I very rarely take drinks into panels because I always

239
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,720
 spill them um so this would not really affect me negatively very much so maybe I'm wrong I don't

240
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,120
 want to restrict people being able to take water in oh well yeah no I mean I think that's fair when

241
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,840
 I say no food and drink I'm sort of doing the because lecture theatres often say no food and

242
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,160
 drink but there is an acceptance that water is pretty much okay um so yes good point Liz do you

243
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,960
 want to get a word in uh I think I've had quite a lot of words on this one but I will take the

244
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,200
 opportunity for another I think you're right but I mean when I'm drinking water from a bottle of

245
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,160
 water I'm not drinking it like I am from a pint I'm like I will really just have a drink and then

246
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,760
 put my mask out and that's what I was doing in all the panels I didn't take any beers into panels

247
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,880
 this time um I thought it was able to leave my mask on because I was surrounded by people that I

248
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,680
 probably basically I was sitting next to different people in every panel and there might be people I

249
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,560
 didn't know was at least in the bar I was sitting next to usually the same people consistently so

250
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,400
 you may have been unmasked but maybe that kind of limited my exposure to that smaller group of people

251
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,400
 I would also say that uh isakon actually didn't say you had to be masked they said you had to wear

252
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,560
 a face covering and I think you could be stricter about was as an acceptable face covering I mean

253
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,520
 it's it's still kind of surprising to me because I come to the UK and like to me there's still a

254
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,240
 shock to it because my expectation is if I get on a train everyone on the train will be wearing a

255
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,120
 mask and they're almost all well-fitting surgical masks or you know kf94 and 95 masks at this point

256
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,680
 with very few cloth masks you know and this is just kind of what what I expect so it was quite

257
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,520
 spicy people with sort of like very loose masks or bandanas or face shields or things that probably

258
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,560
 not really having much of an effect I don't know if I you'd just get that little bit of extra safety

259
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:31,360
 by saying people have to wear an actual face mask which is well fitted I will say like and obviously

260
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:41,040
 I'm not an expert but I would I have moved to using FFP2 and FFP3 masks not everyone will find

261
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,320
 that they fit their faces very well but there's also the N95, the N99 and various other countries

262
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,400
 standards and I would encourage listeners to explore the options because I find I find the FFP3s

263
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,640
 especially are actually much nicer to wear than a cloth mask cloth mask because they don't fog my

264
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,040
 glasses up so I have found that to be an enormous quality of life upgrade generally but certainly

265
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,560
 at this point I think it's probably time to make the switch because they fit you John people were

266
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,000
 seeing the praises of KF94 at Smuffcord and it was a it was completely revelation,

267
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,200
 being so much happier. Yeah that's so much more comfortable but I mean I guess two more things

268
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,760
 I want to say one is you know we can suggest things around the edges they could have done but I don't

269
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,000
 think there is anything that would have fundamentally made the difference from 10% got infected to you

270
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,200
 know one person got infected or zero people got infected apart from you have to mask up everywhere

271
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,880
 and even then people still going to eat hotel breakfast so maybe this is all like fiddling

272
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,480
 around the edges of the problem. Can we can we get into the bit that you had in the show notes about

273
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,240
 the um are you on my Norwegian Christmas party and it goes? The other thing the question here is of

274
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,240
 course we don't have a control easter-colm we don't know how much spread there would have been

275
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:01,760
 if we'd had no cover policy at all apart from you know don't actively spit on people. Yeah so I

276
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,280
 I found this an interesting paper which is from the very early stage of the Omicron variant really I

277
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,480
 think before we knew a lot about it and this has probably become written up as a paper and become

278
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,280
 noteworthy because it was a large outbreak but it's basically a Christmas party where all the attendees

279
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,280
 were vaccinated and asked to test beforehand and they still managed to spread to I think 74%

280
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,280
 of attendees so if you think of that as being like the upper bound of what is possible in a super

281
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,720
 spread event then EasterCon is doing poorly but clearly not as poorly as we could have done if

282
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,480
 we had had no masking rules whatsoever maybe. Yeah so I have to say there's a caveat here because

283
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,520
 a lot of people in Britain have had COVID in the last six weeks so which is probably not the true

284
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,000
 of the Christmas party yeah well at the Christmas party cooked very early on in the Omicron spread

285
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,840
 no one had had Omicron crucially so that was the that was the issue. I would also say there was

286
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:03,120
 some discontent on Discord in the run up to the convention people mostly I think people who were

287
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,760
 not attending the EaseCon grumbling about the fact that people were reporting the people in the hotel

288
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:15,040
 weren't wearing masks and weren't complying with the convention mask policy I do want to say that

289
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,320
 I think those complaints are a bit I actually know I think those complaints were a lot unfair

290
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,720
 I think the convention controlled as much of the masking policy maybe with the exception of the

291
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,720
 disco as they possibly could have done and like we can't blame the convention and it's not fair to

292
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,720
 get snooty at the convention if other guests in the hotel or hotel staff the day before the convention

293
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,680
 staff starts are choosing not to wear masks I am annoyed at the government and at Britain as a

294
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:50,800
 culture but I'm not annoyed at Phil Dyson and his team. The convention couldn't do more than

295
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,640
 they were legally able to do and they probably overstepped what they were legally able to do

296
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,480
 by requiring vaccination from every member so but nobody has a problem with that sort of sign.

297
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,280
 Yeah I would say what we can clearly see is that even with what seemed to be

298
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,720
 pretty reasonable COVID precautions it's absolutely not possible to have a convention which is totally

299
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,280
 COVID safe and like I said all the things but we're doing a kind of like trying to like you know make

300
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,200
 a policy slightly stricter but they won't reduce it to zero and that just says basically that

301
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,680
 there's no way we can make in-person conventions at this point safe for everyone and so we just

302
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,080
 have to make them as safe as possible but accept that unfortunately at this point we can't have

303
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:39,040
 in-person conventions for everyone. Although a lot of the people at EasterCon who got COVID were

304
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,840
 people like you know party animals and dealers who were talking to a great many different people

305
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,120
 it is also true to the ton of the people who got COVID were people who were not spending any time

306
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,640
 in unmasked eating and drinking spaces who will blast the full time who being extremely careful

307
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,440
 and so I think that really underlines the fact that we we just don't have a safe option here for

308
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,160
 people at the moment. So which is why we have to have excellence in hybrid conventions all

309
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,320
 join conversation please. Hand levitation. Yeah but conversation is definitely going to

310
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,800
 have a convention for people even people who don't feel that they can come and people that's in person.

311
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,040
 And so is levitation. Is this going to be dueling EasterCon for like the next year?

312
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:28,240
 Yeah no no absolutely. Oh no it's not dueling I'm just making the point that we are all so aiming

313
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,760
 for this excellent. Yeah the next two Eastercons are both very committed to hybridity it's going to

314
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,800
 happen. Yep 100%. This is one of the things that annoyed me about NovaCon because I had a few

315
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:47,600
 people at NovaCon say that it was privileged to have had online conventions because not everyone

316
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,600
 has the technical access. I think one of the things that NovaCon and EasterCon have shown in spades

317
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,680
 is that it is also privileged to have inversion conventions. It is a different privilege but you

318
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,840
 can't attend an inversion convention if you are at high risk and that is a privilege that those of

319
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,960
 us who are not at high risk have. And obviously you can't attend a virtual convention if you don't

320
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,720
 have the technical skill and so that's a privilege that those of us with the technical skill have

321
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,840
 and that's why doing hybrid conventions is good because it means that you open that net to as many

322
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,920
 people as you plausibly can. I can't see I can't see many ways we can significantly reduce the

323
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,920
 privilege through hybrid conventions more than we are doing. I am going to repeat my offer here

324
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:39,200
 which is that if you have somebody who cannot get on to online conventions I can send them a Mac

325
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,800
 and show them what they need to do. I can do a hybrid convention and a box kit. I'll probably

326
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,400
 did crowdfund if a lot of people probably would say yes this is the thing I need but you know I

327
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:57,520
 was trying to sell a Mac that will do an online convention for you for £60 at EasterCon and I

328
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,840
 did not get any takers so you know and that wasn't by any means the lowest technical kit that

329
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,440
 that'll do the job. I will also say that next episode if we announce our Patreon that's a signal

330
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,080
 that lots of people took Alison up on her offer so do keep your eyes peeled for that.

331
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,280
 There are all these Macs are going to have sponsored by provided by Octa thought

332
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:27,760
 of the spray painted in purple on the side. Spray painted in purple yeah I had one more thing to

333
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:35,040
 say about Norwescon which is that Norwescon commented favorably on the example of a panelist

334
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,400
 who left the convention because they had been pinged as a close contact and if EasterCon had

335
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,120
 done that the entire convention would have left by Monday lunchtime. Did I don't think I got

336
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,480
 anything more than EasterCon? I got pinged afterwards. I got pinged so often Monday and she'd say

337
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,040
 that my phone was like a fruit machine. No I didn't I don't think I got pinged on Monday I got

338
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:05,120
 pinged on Tuesday. No I got pinged on Monday lunchtime just pinged just before Octa thought actually.

339
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:12,720
 Then we drank the beer. Oh no it was just after Octa thought. Oh good. Because it was between

340
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,080
 when we drank the beer and they were like I hugged Liz to say goodbye I was like Liz I've been pinged

341
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,400
 and she was like half a fuck sake. So anyway if anyone was thinking I walked

342
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,240
 through up a good on Covid I should listen to their advice. I like that we've rounded off this

343
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,520
 discussion with a great anecdote illustrating the dangers of believing what you hear on the internet.

344
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,520
 Do as we say not as we did at EasterCon. Yeah I was going to say there's a very famous

345
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:46,720
 fan scene called daysnade so yeah do as we say not as we do. I do not regret hugging either of you

346
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,720
 at at EasterCon that was good it was nice to see you babe. Well neither of us got Covid so

347
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,600
 it didn't get Covid so therefore I don't regret it if I got Covid so I might have been

348
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,920
 written it I was quite worried about my PC artist. I don't know and maybe I don't know if you agree

349
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,080
 with me Liz but like it's very difficult to tell whether I would have behaved differently if I

350
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,640
 hadn't recently had Covid. I don't think I would have done I think I behaved much the same but like

351
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:21,520
 it did reassure me like I was like I was I was fairly convinced that unless there was a new

352
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,760
 variant like a BA3 or a BA4 or a BA5 that was very prevalent at EasterCon I would probably not

353
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,800
 get it because I had already I think had BA2. I don't know whether you think that your recent

354
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,960
 booster affected your behaviour much. I don't think it affected my behaviour it just made me feel

355
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,280
 that little bit safer and specifically in my case because there was a mandatory PCR to

356
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:52,480
 get back home at the time and so you know failing that would have been quite annoying and potentially

357
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,320
 quite expensive. I was very pleased when I heard you got that. Yes I was also very pleased.

358
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,600
 That was the bit that was most worrying me is oh god. Yes I think in hindsight it would have been fine

359
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,840
 and that has now been abolished so it's not a big issue. I mean I was said don't want to get

360
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,800
 Covid but I also didn't want to have to deal with um you know trying to arrange isolation and so on.

361
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,840
 But my booster was five months ago and I have been sitting in a house for two years so I was

362
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,400
 pretty certain I was going to catch Covid over the weekend. I would have been quite surprised if I

363
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,520
 hadn't especially if there would have been 75 reported cases and I hadn't been one of them.

364
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,080
 Not them we do. Yeah I would have been phoning up the are you immune to Covid we want to know about

365
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,920
 it people. So I was I was expected to get it I got it it was less bad than I was expecting so it's been

366
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,960
 okay. I think we may have done I'm going to suggest that we have done far too much fighting on

367
00:34:46,960 --> 00:35:01,280
 about Covid and let's get on with some other. Congratulations to fear for winning TAF.

368
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:09,920
 You sure that's fear and not fire? Yeah 100% sorry that's a well conché. Oh I thought I thought

369
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,920
 you yeah no I'm um you know it it was. Sorry I thought it was funny I'm sorry I had a push to

370
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,160
 the show that's my fault of it. It's not it's not bad. Great race run very well more

371
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,640
 more voters than at any time since 2006. That's good for TAF good for the fanfans generally

372
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,800
 helps people know about fanfans. We're looking forward to seeing um fear in Chicago because we're

373
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,880
 all going to be there. Yep um we would like to encourage yeah we would like to encourage

374
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,480
 everyone who didn't win TAF to run for TAF again so that they can win next time all of them three

375
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,400
 way tie. Yeah I mean great candidates would still I mean I was very honored to have nominated and

376
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,680
 as I would love to see him run again and win next time that would be very good um and yeah I had

377
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,480
 some very hard choices in voting I would be happy to see that the moving candidates run again things.

378
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,720
 It's very disheartening to lose a race but you mustn't think oh no that means people

379
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,480
 don't think I'd be a good candidate I think everyone would have been a great delegate this time and

380
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,600
 and um it's just only one of them could win and that was fear so.

381
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,960
 Yeah we're all going to strike on. I've booked my flights at my hotel and my travel insurance and

382
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,760
 um and I've got my not a visa whatever it's called. Esther and here and so yeah we're definitely

383
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,280
 going. What about you John? Uh I've got my flights and I've booked my hotel which was eye

384
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,720
 wateringly expensive and I haven't yet got around to doing the travel insurance I should probably do

385
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,800
 that and I've got membership have you got membership? Oh yeah no we've got membership yeah so yes the

386
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,440
 entire thing was eye watering expensive the entire thing was like oh my god it's a good thing we have

387
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,840
 an offset mortgage. It's like what do you spend your mortgage what do you use your offset mortgage

388
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,160
 for an extension? No we're paid to go to Chai Con and worrying about paying off the mortgage some

389
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:25,200
 other year. I have booked nothing um but what membership? That was why I went around this line of

390
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,480
 things I was fairly sure this is where we get to. Yeah I just haven't got myself organized.

391
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,680
 Yeah I bought membership. A very kind person uh sold me their uh unwanted attending membership

392
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,320
 and I swapped it for my sporting membership so it works out for both of us so that was very nice.

393
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,520
 Yeah I'll get around to doing it I just have not actually kind of figured out any of the logistics

394
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:55,760
 of the horrendous 24 hour journey that I will have to take to get to Chicago so yeah might be

395
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,480
 putting that off you so to think about it. Um we Chicago is supposed to be lovely.

396
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,480
 Isn't it lovely? Um yeah I've never been to Chicago I'm very excited.

397
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,960
 Are you not? And I keep getting more excited because people keep saying oh Chicago is kind of like

398
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,680
 New York as if it had effective city planning and a socialist government and that's like oh that

399
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,920
 sounds good. I don't remember you know the giant Trump tower on the Chicago waterfront giving me

400
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:31,520
 a very socialist value. The specific thing they said was unlike New York and I think also London

401
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,720
 though London is getting better about this um Chicago has treated its waterfront as being a

402
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,720
 public good for over a hundred years and um and so therefore it has lots of lovely parklands

403
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,440
 and it has lots of good stuff and it's all very near the hotel and everything's very walkable

404
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,800
 and that also sounded good to me apart from it's going to be as hard as the furs of hell but

405
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,240
 probably not for Liz. No it'd probably be quite a nice temperature for me.

406
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,040
 Yes I mean one reason the hotel is I want to be expensive is because uh it genuinely is in the

407
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,240
 middle of Chicago unlike you know long come where we're like come to London maybe zone three and

408
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,880
 this is generally right in the centre. And I think when you say I want to really expensive I think

409
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,800
 it's about the same price as satellites hotel which is also I want to really expensive. Yeah I

410
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,920
 accept that if you wanted to put four of you into a room at Chai Con you could do in which case it

411
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,840
 wouldn't be expensive at all. I mean there's obviously an opt to thought sitcom hijinks sensual

412
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:35,360
 there. All five of us are in one room and Liz has the path yes. They are big hotel rooms though I

413
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,680
 mean I've been to went to the world come there in 2012 and we did put four of us in a hotel room

414
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,560
 and it was fine fine but I was younger then. Yeah I mean I did yeah it would be it would be much

415
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,240
 cheaper than Niestcon hotel. At the previous Chai Con I had four people to my room and we also had

416
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,320
 a deep dish pizza in there which basically counts as an entire person on its own so uh yep quite big.

417
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,200
 I ate cold because pizza for lunch one day and I felt so ill don't do that.

418
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,440
 No we had a breakfast it was that absolute best like 100% recommended would do again.

419
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:14,720
 Last time I was in New York my New York friends said we have to show you what pizza true pizza is

420
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,040
 like and it turns out the true pizza in New York is very like true pizza in Walthamstow and was not

421
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,480
 at all the sort of pizza I missed terribly since leaving the United States in 1982 which is Chicago

422
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,240
 pizza and I am really very much looking forward to eating some Chicago pizza. This actually segues

423
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:39,920
 very neatly to picks. So in today's picks my pick is Detroit style pizza. I live in a city now

424
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,040
 listeners that has Detroit style pizza and I can order it whenever I want and it is bloody

425
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:52,960
 glorious. It is basically a large square which is deeper than most pizza but less deep than a Chicago

426
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:00,160
 pizza and you get like this delicious kind of almost but not quite burnt cheese crust around

427
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,200
 the edges and it is incredibly nice and the place near us does it with sort of ricotta cheese and

428
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,680
 fennel sausage and lots of other lovely toppings and I've been enormously enjoying that.

429
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,720
 But I'm looking forward to Chicago deep dish as well very much. I mean it's a pie basically isn't

430
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:26,320
 it's like a quiche in a pizza I had a baby. A very cheesy baby. Yeah and the baby favoured the

431
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:32,880
 quiche more than the pizza except with less eggs. Tune in to our new podcast British people explain

432
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,120
 American food every other Thursday on this feed. Our transcripts have a whole thing where we try

433
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,640
 and explain cookies. I don't see why we couldn't have a whole British people explain American food

434
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,200
 segment most weeks actually. When we're in Chicago we're going to have a pancake breakfast did we

435
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,840
 say that already? We're not on the podcast but we did say it to ourselves yes. No we're going to

436
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,160
 have it I think we could have say this on the podcast we're going to have a pancake breakfast.

437
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,960
 At least one pancake breakfast maybe six or seven. At least one pancake breakfast together.

438
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,080
 Oh yeah I've also got like six or seven pancake breakfast with that probably. Yeah I mean I'm

439
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,800
 going to pose here and now that instead of doing a live octa talk at Chicago we just go around

440
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,520
 eating various American foodstuffs and making mini podcasts about them and by the end of the

441
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,720
 convention we might be hunted down by every American. I mean by all means do write to the

442
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,840
 Chicago program team and demand not to thought live that would be quite funny. No God don't do

443
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,400
 that because I'm on the Chicago program team and it'd be slightly embarrassing. Yeah please all

444
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,800
 tweet at Liz demanding octa talk live listeners. I don't have that sort of power John.

445
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:47,200
 So my pick while I had Covid I got to read some books that are purely entertaining and not informative

446
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,000
 or improving in any way and several of my friends have suggested that you could do this all the time

447
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,760
 but it's more fun than reading the sort of highfalutin stuff but anyway I've really enjoyed

448
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,040
 Mortal Engines by Philip Reeve a bit late for Eastercom. If I had read it a few weeks earlier I could

449
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,880
 have go up to where the Eastercom said I really really loved your book which I did. Thought it was

450
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,080
 great looking forward to the rest. I liked the fact that you didn't pull its punches because

451
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,960
 it's a kids book but it kind of goes into places that kids books don't necessarily always go and

452
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,040
 it did quite well and I liked how inventive it was and I liked how cinematic it was though apparently

453
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:32,720
 the movie is terrible so that's a bit sad but I did like the fact that it evoked cinematic

454
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,360
 images in my brain which I like and it was good fun and I've got the second one out of the library

455
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,680
 good library. It's great to get rid of reading old books is that libraries have them in stock

456
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,080
 and you can read them. So my my pick the week I will have to be slightly circumspected about it

457
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:54,480
 because my pick is a video game Horizon Forbidden West it's equal to the video game Horizon Zero Dawn

458
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,840
 Alison has left because Alison has not finished playing Horizon Zero Dawn which is going to hear

459
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,800
 what I say when he listens back to the podcast anyway but I know John is also playing Horizon

460
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,240
 Forbidden West and I think he's not finished. I have gotten to the point where I'm at the bottom

461
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,400
 of a hill and I told Neil this and he went oh your age is behind so that probably tells you that

462
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,800
 I'm quite a long way behind everyone I know who's playing it. Bottom of a hill? Oh oh oh right.

463
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:31,040
 Yeah so I've gone down a big rope like lift thing and an awkward man has been awkward at me

464
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:39,280
 and I have told him to get get you know and gone off to do my alloy thing like an absolute legend.

465
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:48,480
 Right so John has played approximately five to ten percent of games so far. Oh I would say less

466
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,560
 than that. There's a lot I finished up I mean I was quite completed about it haven't finished

467
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,920
 everything but I've done basic here if you quite still could find and I end up on about 110 hours

468
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,640
 played so that'll give you an idea of how long it is but yeah if you played I'm trying to think

469
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,360
 of a good way of explaining it that doesn't spy either Horizon Zero Dawn or Horizon Forbidden West

470
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:17,120
 too much for those who haven't played them basically you players A-9, a heroine who was an outcast from

471
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:26,480
 her tribe and lives in a sort of this kind of future where humans are living in kind of separated

472
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,640
 tribes in a kind of very fairly primitive existence but they're all these giant robot machines

473
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,760
 driving about and what's going on with that and what's going on with that is what you're

474
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,320
 going to find out over playing the course of both of these games. The first one is spectacularly good

475
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,640
 the second one is still pretty good but maybe not quite as spectacularly good because

476
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,400
 the novelty isn't quite there finding out kind of the second act of the story is not quite as

477
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,160
 exciting as all the stuff that gets unraveled in the first act but it is still great you're still

478
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:03,280
 essentially roaming around this giant open world you know shooting giant mechanical animals and

479
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,280
 sneaking up behind them and you know throwing sticky bombs at them and shooting them with different

480
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,520
 ammo and you know going around meeting all these different tribes which they do a great job of

481
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,480
 kind of having all these distinct groups of people with their own kind of traditions and building

482
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:27,600
 styles and outfits that look really distinctive and I would say that my main piece of the second

483
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,560
 one is they put too much stuff in it so we're in the first one I had like six different weapons

484
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,320
 and this one I have like 12 different weapons that do 27 different things and I spent way too

485
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,440
 long trying to work out okay what is the optimal weapon for shooting this giant crocodile machine

486
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,960
 in the face a lot and it also has the very annoying thing where if you kind of pause for too long

487
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,920
 Aloy will say something helpful like maybe I should scan for a point of interest and things

488
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,640
 like this and it's like no I'm on my way to do what you're just about to tell me to do it's just I

489
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,240
 fell off this cliff and have to climb back up again and that gets surprisingly jarring after 100 hours

490
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:10,960
 of it but I did really enjoy it even on PlayStation 4 it looks spectacular the voice acting is pretty

491
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,440
 great throughout and it's just 100 hours of fun so if you haven't played the first one and you

492
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,200
 have a PlayStation you should go and get it right now and if you haven't played it and you haven't

493
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,240
 or bought a PlayStation then you should go out and buy a PlayStation which you say goes very well

494
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:33,040
 into a while or something was about to say I bought a PlayStation to play this game I didn't

495
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,440
 realize it at the time I thought I was buying it to play a different game but it turns out that

496
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,480
 this is the game I bought the PlayStation to buy and the other thing about the first one is that

497
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:49,360
 it's a game that's so good that it tipped the conversation on best games Hugo from oh well I can

498
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,240
 see that there's an argument for why we might have best games Hugo to obviously we need to have a

499
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,040
 best games Hugo so that we can give the Hugo to things that are like this and it reminded me very

500
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:05,920
 much of what happened with Watchman back in the mid 80s which was that they had to invent a special

501
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:11,440
 Hugo for Watchman because they didn't have best graphic novel at the time I think that is fair

502
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,120
 I think Horizon and Zero Dawn is like the first time I played a game where I was like oh this is

503
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:22,880
 like great science fiction in a game and I don't think I'd had that prior to that point like it's

504
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,880
 not like there hadn't been science fiction in games like Mass Effect is an obvious example

505
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:40,160
 but I think Horizon I'm now played Mass Effect and it was okay but Horizon really tickled me now I

506
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,880
 will also say that I'm not sure that Sony quite realizes how popular the franchise is and I say

507
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,360
 this because they released a Horizon Zero Dawn Lego set and it sold out within five hours of coming

508
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:57,440
 out I went to get it from the Lego shop and they did not have any more there had been a big queue

509
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:07,600
 the time the store opened no so you don't have one and I did not get my tall neck no John I know

510
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:13,440
 but I am kind of happy about this because I think it shows that there is appetite for the

511
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,120
 franchise I think that is good yeah what's their first first Horizon thing wasn't it

512
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,760
 Sony probably has a very good idea of how successful the franchise is on account of how

513
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:30,640
 they have sales figures they won't know how many people are buying second-hand play stations to

514
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,000
 play it but they know how many people are playing it because obviously they're tracking every

515
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,360
 minute I spend playing it and things like that they know the thing they didn't know is what the

516
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:48,560
 overlap between Horizon fans and Lego fans is and I think it's probably higher than they expected

517
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:54,480
 but I don't but I don't think it's fair to say that the sales figures of a video game reflect the

518
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,240
 cultural penetration of that video game in isolation I suspect there are games that have sold as well

519
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,280
 as Horizon that have not got the same level of cultural penetration and therefore I suspect you

520
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:11,120
 need more data than just that one number to work that out yeah it's a very good game though it is

521
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,800
 it's so good yeah so good and I haven't played the second one yet but I'm looking forward to it

522
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,920
 they'll probably take it I am now something like 52% of the way through the first one so I'm

523
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,520
 I'd further on with it than than I had thought have you found out that all of the animals are

524
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:32,720
 robots yet spoilers listeners all of the animals are not robots because otherwise I've been eating

525
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,840
 a lot of robot that's not great some of the animals are bloody little rabbits and you have to kill

526
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:44,640
 the rabbit to make your pouch for holding arrows bigger which is the worst mechanic oh yes I

527
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,680
 am going to have some a little whine about Horizon and I don't know if this is improved in the sequel

528
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,360
 but if I had to complain about things it would be like I am like umptium games in hours into this

529
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,320
 game where umptium is a lot I'm still having to wander around picking up bloody herbs everywhere

530
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:06,800
 and that is pissing me off and I also have to keep shooting animals and that is also pissing me off

531
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,120
 and I could be doing without that those quite relaxing it's kind of very meditative to sort of

532
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,600
 wander around the countryside filling up one's medicine pouch and which I need to do because

533
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:22,320
 obviously all of the giant robot things kick my butt repeatedly because that bit where I suppose

534
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,520
 to work out what weapon I should use I'm just going if I stand on a legend hit far arrows into

535
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,000
 this it will die eventually and that doesn't seem to be true in most cases so my other complaint

536
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,680
 about the game is that actually there's a lot of there's a lot of quests in this game and a lot

537
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,000
 of them work exactly the same way and I'm getting a little bit tired of it but I mean I have time

538
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,840
 for fun so what I'm gonna do I will look up before the next episode exactly how many crabs

539
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,920
 I have massacred in order to make a lot of these rope pouches and so on because the second game

540
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:00,240
 is not any better about that I killed so many crabs I've killed so many owls I killed some

541
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:08,720
 seagulls and felt slightly bad about it yes for any owl feathers okay she's dead to me and I need

542
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,560
 like three owl feathers to make a pouch and apparently I'm such a bad hunter that this takes at least

543
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:18,320
 12 owls to get enough feathers to make my pouch and then it's like well done you have a level

544
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,960
 three pouch now make a level four pouch with some more owl feathers yeah so one of the things

545
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,600
 that's very annoying about the hunting the thing that's very annoying about the hunting mini-game

546
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:33,200
 is that you don't all no matter how effectively you kill these beasts you don't always get the

547
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,640
 thing you're looking for that is very annoying like life I'm like I got over this in video games

548
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,520
 ooh bring me an iridescent crab shell why'd need a particular iridescent crab shell

549
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,560
 well because it's pretty hellous I will also say this doesn't count as a re-pick because when we

550
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:54,480
 discussed it in episode 39 we haven't invented picks yet so it gets off on a technicality

551
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,600
 also it's we have got a long tradition of going round it also she

552
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,560
 this is talking about the second game that I talked about the first game

553
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,560
 I'm talking about the second one and also we have a long tradition of getting distracted and

554
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,560
 talking about video games a lot because that's the sort of content that Mark Lumbelowt

555
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:17,520
 and it's midnight in Bangkok so that was the Octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me

556
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,040
 it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

 [Music]

558
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,000
 yeah well done and we didn't have 15 minutes of talking about Arkham Horror

559
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,600
 no the theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin McLeod in
