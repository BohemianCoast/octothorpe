1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 I'm reminded now of Steve Davis talking about the experience of trying to get snacks in his parents' house

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,680
 and that his mother would say, "There is a chicken carcass in the fridge, there is plenty of meat on it."

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,480
 And he would find meat on all sorts of bits of a chicken that you didn't know that there was meat on it.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,760
 Which proved useful later when I asked him to strip a chicken for me and I discovered that the amount of chicken you can get off of,

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,080
 a chicken is much greater than I hear to forebelieve.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,840
 Anyway, the amount of chicken you can get out of the Hugo Verto packet is very large, people, but there are still some weird grisly bits.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,840
 *gasp* Well, well that's good.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:55,280
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 59th episode of OctaThorp, the podcast for Science Fiction and Science Fiction fandom,

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,160
 which is coming to you on the 9th of June 2022. I'm John Coxon.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
 I'm Alison Scott.

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,640
 And I'm Liz Batty.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
 And we have letters of comments.

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,880
 The first letter of comment is from Dave Coxon saying, "Isn't that artwork good though?"

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,280
 And it was good. Thank you very much to Brad W. Foster for doing the spectacular artwork for last episode.

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,000
 I have the original line art winging its weight in my house so I can put it on my wall.

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,640
 Yeah, thank you very much to Brad. And if you're an artist and you would like to know the art specifications for OctaThorp,

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,800
 if you can't work the app from first principles, do get in touch and we will send them to you.

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,640
 We would love you to do art for the podcast for no reward whatsoever, except that we're very nice about it on the board.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:48,560
 And if you want to make like 30 to 40 dollars selling me a copy of the original artwork, you know, that's apparently a good wheeze.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,360
 Oh yeah, let me know which ones you want, John, and we'll sort that out.

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,360
 I mean, that's the problem, right? Because maybe all of them and that is Orcs.

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,320
 Yeah, but Alison's art is digital, which means she can make bank on this by saying a copy to you and a copy to me.

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,560
 Because I quite like the one where I'm going to kidnap them up.

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:17,040
 Oh, well, actually Brad also sent me the like finished colored version and I'm going to print that out and mount them in the same frame.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,400
 So that would look nice.

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,600
 He did also on the line art spell it OctaHord instead of OctaThorp, which I thought was quite funny.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,520
 Podcasts for Tidium.

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:36,800
 We got various people saying. So Johnny, Johnny Badley said that he agrees that podcasts are good for work Tidium and alleybaker books and Virginia Preston both said that

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,280
 podcast are also very good for car journeys.

30
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,520
 Virginia particularly said that she listened to OctaThorp as she drove to her sisters this morning and she hardly minded to the North Circular being slow.

31
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,880
 So that is high praise. Thank you all.

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,280
 OctaThorp better than being stuck in a traffic jam on the North Circular officially.

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,040
 I think it's better than being stuck on a traffic jam on the North Circular without OctaThorp.

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,080
 We got several letters about convention data and Lillian wrote and said,

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:19,680
 "My bat radar went spong when you mentioned people who might be quite good on panels but are never going to fill in a 200 page form and yes, possibly we did mean you Lillian."

36
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:31,680
 She also said she'd absolutely loved to be involved in data, a panel item about data and of course Lillian is a very famous data professor type person.

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,360
 So that might quite good.

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,160
 And she says this happens a lot of academic conferences too, which I'm sure is right.

39
00:03:38,160 --> 00:04:01,920
 Chris Garcia writes in to say that when he wrote when he ran the fanzine lounge at Reno, one of the things he got was a box of stuff which included panel kind of data from 10 different conventions and the kind of undertaking he did to analyze that data revealed to him that there was no trend.

40
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,600
 And so that's the flip side. We might do all of this work and find out that it's just random and that would be sad.

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,320
 But thanks, Chris, for alerting us in his regular role as the pessimist of science fiction fandom.

42
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,480
 I think we can all agree that we associate Chris with pessimism and downturned mouths.

43
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:30,400
 But the lovely thing about machine learning is that you can take data where there is no correlation and nothing to be learned and you can pull out results from it anyway.

44
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
 I think that's why people like it so much.

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Ooh, shots fired.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,120
 Yeah, I'm going to disagree with Chris.

47
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:46,240
 I mean, in a way, if you do all the work in the analysis and then find that there is no correlation, what you've learned, I guess, is that we don't need to keep doing this analysis because there's nothing to be learned from it.

48
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,720
 So maybe we should take that as a lesson.

49
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,120
 Yes. No, it's a good point.

50
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,680
 It's a good point.

51
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,800
 A negative result is a silly useful result.

52
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:06,960
 We did have some letters on the topic of Worldcon, Malcolm Hutchison at Rites to ask now that people can read their favorite podcast about science fiction and fandom.

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,760
 Will anyone complete the circle and have it read out to them as an audiobook?

54
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:19,520
 And if you'd like the Rites to make the audiobook of the OctaThort transcript, do get in touch. We're selling them at a very reasonable rate.

55
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:33,360
 What I think we should do is take all the data for previous OctaThorts and feed it into a machine learning model and then get the voices that it created for that to read out the podcast.

56
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,520
 Fair wise.

57
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:42,560
 Oh, no, I'm going to use a machine learning model to generate an entirely new podcast and see if you can put it out as the next podcast and see if anyone can tell the difference.

58
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,080
 We should do that as a filler episode.

59
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,000
 It might be harder to edit the real well, but I think we've had that idea before as well.

60
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,960
 I think it would take more of our time collectively than just recording an episode of OctaThort is the problem.

61
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:01,600
 Something that came up about knowing why panelists are on panels at a zoom meeting recently.

62
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:13,200
 I was made aware that at bolticon, moderators of panels got the answers the panelists had written about why they would be good on the panel and that helped them shape the discussion.

63
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,760
 And I had not appreciated that, but that is very clever.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:28,480
 I think that's feedback from Gillian Perlach, who said that she was on panels at bolticon and thought they were all excellent because the moderators were better prepared than usual because of the new style programming system.

65
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,480
 And she said all the panels she went to or was on had excellent people who knew what they were talking about like Gillian.

66
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:45,960
 I don't know if that will be exposed in the title interface, but I mean, it's basically, you know, if you're doing a panel, then usually the moderator might email everyone and say, Hello, can you tell me something about who you are and why you're on this panel.

67
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:57,600
 And you're just basically taking that information early and hopefully feeding it to the moderator and using it to kind of shape the people on the panel rather than only collecting it later on.

68
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,680
 Yeah, I think moderate practice varies a lot.

69
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:15,920
 If Chicago aren't willing to do it, I mean, it might be something they could look at because I think it does sound like, especially a convention that doesn't have a green room culture in the way that East cons and other British conventions do, I can see that it might make the panel much more.

70
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,560
 Able to explore the expertise is always panelists in a way that I think could be really, really positive.

71
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
 So then that's really cool.

72
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:33,320
 After the last episode, I wrote to Alison and Liz to very excitedly tell them that Raybearer is getting the Netflix treatment and Liz replied saying.

73
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,720
 Oh, yeah, I already knew that. And I forgot to mention on the podcast.

74
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,240
 Well, she was like, don't care about TV, care about books.

75
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
 And I was like, that is fair.

76
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,000
 But I.

77
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,160
 Is that what I said?

78
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,480
 OK.

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,040
 Yeah, you should clip that bit where Liz says she doesn't care about it.

80
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,840
 She forgot to mention it on the podcast out for future use.

81
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,240
 I forgot.

82
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,000
 And I said that I forgot and I made a funny comment there.

83
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,280
 So thank you for reminding me, John.

84
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:09,040
 And I write round after the podcast to say that Abigail Disbaum wrote an essay about everything everywhere, all at once, which was much more thoughtful and erudite than anything I managed to think about the movie.

85
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,200
 So I want to look into it this time.

86
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,720
 It's very good.

87
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,440
 Yeah, it's very annoying when she does that.

88
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:21,040
 So you wrote a much, much better review of she who became the son that I could manage when I was doing it as a pick.

89
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,280
 So maybe we'll say that when we do the Hugo discussion episode.

90
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,720
 Oh, good.

91
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
 I should read that as well.

92
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,920
 I have nearly finished now.

93
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,040
 And my opinion of it has gone up quite a bit from where it was halfway through.

94
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:38,800
 We have been having we have been having discussions about American food stuff on our British podcast.

95
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,960
 And to get revenge may not actually be anything connected.

96
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,200
 Athena Scalzi has written a blog post about a British snack box on whatever.

97
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:56,040
 And it's worth reading just because reading an American described pickled onion crisps is brilliant.

98
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,080
 Ten out of ten would read again.

99
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,840
 We should take pickled onion monster monster Chicago and just give them out to people.

100
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,480
 Because I think that would really confuse everyone.

101
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,680
 Hi there.

102
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,400
 Pickled onion crisps are very normal.

103
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,680
 Not in the States.

104
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:24,080
 It says in our show notes that Alison has learned a lesson, which seems, you know, unlikely.

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,720
 Thanks for that.

106
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,200
 Alison, do you want to expand?

107
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,400
 I believe I've learned a lesson from Eastercon in that one of the things we did.

108
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,120
 He's come was we spent a lot of time hanging out with our mates without any masks on and at Shycon.

109
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,920
 I'm planning to spend a lot of time hanging out with my mates and other fans with masks on because I am in charge of a

110
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,640
 COVID aware social space at Shycon, which is the fanzine lounge.

111
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,160
 So they asked me what job title do you want as the person who is running the fanzine lounge?

112
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,880
 And I said I want to be a salon here.

113
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,960
 So my division head has had to look up that word because they don't really do French in America.

114
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,360
 So I am I am a woman who runs a salon.

115
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,240
 And I am hoping it is somewhere where all the interesting people will hang out.

116
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:19,800
 I have two seconds in this who are Nigel Rowe and who's a local Chicago fan and

117
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,920
 is Spaniya Sherriff, who makes pancakes, but maybe not for the fancy lounge, but you know,

118
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,720
 but who actually ran the fancy lounge at Helsinki and they are helping me.

119
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,200
 And so although it's so the fancy lounge is one of these things that's got a bit of a history and

120
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,920
 the traditional name is fancy in lounge, but really what this is meant to be is for a lounge

121
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,920
 for the community of active fans who do fan things and want to get together with other people

122
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,560
 who do fan things and talk about them for, you know, to chat, not have big panel items on them

123
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,760
 or formal organization, organized things.

124
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,440
 But that probably means fan casters as well and fan writers and fan artists and other people of that kind.

125
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,400
 So if you're somebody who's fan, whose primary involvement in fandom is doing stuff rather than

126
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,520
 necessarily appreciating stuff, this is the space for you, I think, come and find us.

127
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,480
 And it's going to be master acquired.

128
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,920
 It's in the exhibits halls.

129
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,600
 So it is not needing or drinking space.

130
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,080
 You'll be able to carry reusable containers and you sip from them.

131
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:34,080
 And I've already had some discussion with active fans about what sorts of containers you can carry around and sip from.

132
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:41,760
 But, you know, when you're thirsty and it's not possible to bake social spaces completely

133
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,680
 COVID free, but we're going to do what we can to help you chill and hang out with people at the con.

134
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,720
 I mean, this is just a general, that's a general strike on thing, isn't it?

135
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,800
 There's going to be some eating, drinking spaces where you can sit and drink half an hour with your mask off.

136
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,240
 And then everywhere else is a mask on social space.

137
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,760
 So what we did at Eastacore, I think, would not be allowed as well as possibly not being the most sensible thing we did at Eastacore.

138
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,880
 I mean, it wasn't the stupidest thing I did at Eastacore, but that's only because I did some really stupid things at Eastacore.

139
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,520
 Did it involve straws and one kind of beer?

140
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,680
 Stupidest things to that.

141
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,720
 You're going to come and hang out with me at the fancy lunch, guys?

142
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,600
 Yeah, I like the fancy lounge.

143
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,160
 Sometimes there's programme in the fancy lounge.

144
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,720
 I was on a programme at renovation on making fanzines with a Spaniard and Jean Martin,

145
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,120
 who was the editor of Science Fiction in San Francisco back in the day.

146
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,680
 And that was very good.

147
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,840
 I remember that panel.

148
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,680
 I'm fondly.

149
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,160
 Is that had you just met a Spaniard at that point?

150
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,680
 Yeah, first convention.

151
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,760
 Or did you meet on the panel?

152
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,880
 No, she was wearing.

153
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:55,120
 She was wearing a t-shirt, which she refers to as her "fuck you, John" t-shirt for reasons that I won't elucidate on the podcast.

154
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,840
 But yeah, no, we had already met at that point.

155
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,760
 She was already wearing a t-shirt just to pitch off in something.

156
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,160
 Yeah.

157
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:14,480
 And also, Jerry Kaufman was on that panel, but he elected to sit in the audience and not really participate, which was, you know, I respect that as a choice.

158
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,160
 So I don't think we're going to have tech, so I don't think we're going to have proper programme, though.

159
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,400
 Liz might correct me if I'm wrong about this.

160
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,200
 I don't know.

161
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:32,680
 But we probably are going to have some micro programme, which I've told in Chantar is going to kind of be the sort of very trivial stuff that flies under the radar of the programme team.

162
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,840
 Where is the fancy lounge going to be?

163
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,160
 Because, to be honest, whether I hang out in it.

164
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,800
 Chicago.

165
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:51,960
 So the back of the exhibit, it's going to be next to fan tables and fanak and the like, world con history stuff and things like that.

166
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:59,200
 OK, because usually it sort of depends on whether it ends up being like a nice-based hangout or whether it ends up being like a sofa.

167
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,800
 So I'll have to see how it goes for you.

168
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:10,120
 I mean, one big thing is that, obviously, normally you can't eat and drink in like the round the fan tables and stuff, and that makes it a

169
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,360
 place I'm less like to hang out.

170
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,080
 But you can't eat and drink anywhere, but I've been designated spaces.

171
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,880
 So, you know, it's not like I'm missing out on being in the bar time, tang out in the fancy lounge.

172
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,360
 Yeah, that's right.

173
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,320
 So, and it is designed to be a bar with no beer unless you bring it yourself in resealable containers.

174
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,760
 I like fan lounges at US conventions.

175
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
 I quite often spend quite a lot of time there.

176
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
 So that makes sense.

177
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,840
 I am looking forward to it.

178
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,400
 Yeah.

179
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,160
 I mean, if everyone, if all my mates decide to hang out somewhere else, I'll be really sad about it.

180
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:49,080
 But I hopefully we're going to get enough people to volunteer to take a couple of our shift in the fancy lounge that I won't be absolutely tied to it all the time.

181
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,920
 But I mean, I think it's going to be a good place to hang out.

182
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,800
 I don't want yours to come and hang out there.

183
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,480
 Probably will hang out there, but only because I don't want to know very many people at Chacon because not as many of the Brits are going.

184
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,880
 So I'll probably come and hang out and meet people, maybe.

185
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,520
 Yeah, people.

186
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,080
 But we'll have fans, right?

187
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,320
 Well, all of our octa thought worldwide listener crew come to say hello to us.

188
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,440
 And I mean, I don't know if we have a worldwide listener crew, right?

189
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,000
 But if you're one of our octa thought worldwide listener crew do come and say hello to us at Chacon.

190
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,760
 We've got Chris Garcia.

191
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,520
 Yeah, we know we have a worldwide listenership because Chris, Chris writes in.

192
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,840
 He's worldwide.

193
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,880
 He lives in California listeners.

194
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,760
 He does.

195
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,520
 Look, between between the two of us and Chris, we're covering three continents.

196
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,280
 So that's pretty good.

197
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,680
 Yeah, this is like Moose.

198
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,760
 It's not so cool for Moose to start up and after about 10 minutes, we've got people from three or four continents.

199
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,200
 So I'm like, this is cool.

200
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,160
 I'm pretty sure we've got a listener in Australia because Roman writes in.

201
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,480
 I think Gillian probably listens.

202
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,840
 But Gillian is difficult.

203
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,960
 Hello, Gillian.

204
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,760
 It might be that she just listens to us on cafe moose and gets the gist.

205
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,560
 So if you listen to the podcast, Gillian, do tell me offer for impugning your integrity.

206
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,440
 So what we do need is a listener from South America and a listener from Antarctica.

207
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,600
 And and listeners from Africa, please and listeners from anywhere in Asia that's not

208
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,160
 Thailand.

209
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,000
 Yeah, basically, any listeners, Asia, who are not me, because I'm not really listening, am I?

210
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,520
 Well, 80% of the time you are.

211
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,320
 According to statistics.

212
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,560
 Oh, no, we're so sorry, Liz.

213
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,400
 Quality, not quantity, John.

214
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,480
 I was going to ask you a question, Alison.

215
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,120
 Are you going to do woof?

216
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,000
 I would like woof to happen.

217
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,200
 I don't personally want to be the organizing editor of woof.

218
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,040
 So if you would like to be the organizing editor of woof and you're listening to this

219
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,840
 podcast, please get in touch.

220
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,720
 Backing up a bit, woof is the worldcom appa.

221
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,440
 Backing up a bit more, an appa, or amatropiriohtical association, is a flying bison.

222
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,320
 Thing where a bunch of people bring along a fan scene and then they pull them all

223
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,560
 together and turn it into a collated fan scene that then gets handed out to everybody.

224
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,920
 And I am a member of a couple of appas at the moment, but there is a there's one that

225
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,120
 happens at Woof called every year.

226
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,720
 And we would definitely like to make that happen in the fancy lounge at Chicago.

227
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,800
 You do need to bring your contributions with you.

228
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,320
 We're not going to print them all off for you.

229
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,600
 Oh, no, I think what that means is you're going to get lots of people being like, but

230
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,800
 where do I print off?

231
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,800
 Copyshops. I mean, if we want to print them all off, then actually I could do that.

232
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,520
 I just need some more budget that I don't have.

233
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,680
 So we might have to, we might do a thing where we go, we could do this, but we're

234
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,000
 going to have a tip jar and less is low in advance.

235
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Do either of you have any questions?

236
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,960
 But definitely podcast is if you're a podcaster and you're listening to this,

237
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,400
 this is a place where you could hang out and meet other people who make and do things.

238
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,000
 No, we if there's one thing we know is that podcasts aren't fanzines, Alison.

239
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,240
 That has been litigated many times in fandom.

240
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,720
 Podcasters are verboten.

241
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,920
 And if you're a podcaster, you will be shunned.

242
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,040
 Hugo girl, come and hang out with us to the fancy latch.

243
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,880
 I, so I had not realized this small

244
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,280
 digression, but I saw a photo of Hugo girl and I did not realize that they,

245
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,240
 they record like around a table.

246
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,160
 And yet?

247
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,600
 No, that explains the champagne.

248
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,240
 Because obviously I beatboxed the champagne because we're not around the table.

249
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,280
 This is deficient.

250
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,480
 We should be round a table more with champagne.

251
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,240
 So we might have to do that in Chicago.

252
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,480
 At breakfast.

253
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,520
 At breakfast? All mimosas.

254
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,920
 Do you think we might have to hang out more than once at Chicago?

255
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,160
 No, I get to the end and I'm like, right, I'm avoiding both of you for the rest of the time.

256
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,800
 He's going to make the Hugo ceremony real awkward.

257
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,520
 Nothing says we have to sit together at the Hugo ceremony.

258
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:52,440
 Yeah, we should try and get the professional photographer on the red carpet to do a picture

259
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,000
 of the three of us rather than just us in couples.

260
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,000
 Yes.

261
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,640
 They do, they do per, they do per finalist photos usually.

262
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,360
 And we've got to stand in the right order.

263
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,000
 Yep.

264
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,400
 And then then people will go, God, Alice really is short.

265
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:17,120
 Shall we talk about the Hugo voter packet?

266
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,040
 Yes.

267
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,720
 The Hugo voter packet has come out and I have downloaded it in its glory.

268
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,200
 There's a lot of good stuff in there.

269
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,440
 I had not realized that not everyone downloads every file and goes through it in order,

270
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,720
 taking everything out and recategorizing it before deleting it.

271
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,080
 Because a lot of people have been surprised that there are books in Best Editor.

272
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,880
 And I was like, well, of course, they're books in Best Editor.

273
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,720
 Because when you opened the Best Editor file, there were books in it.

274
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,280
 And I had not realized not everyone does it like that.

275
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,160
 I even downloaded Best Dramatic Presentation long form just to check.

276
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,960
 There's nothing, I don't think there's much in there, but, you know,

277
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,040
 because I didn't download Best Editor because normally it's just a list of stuff,

278
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,560
 stuff people have edited and I'm on that budget.

279
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,320
 It wasn't last year, it had lots of things in it.

280
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,720
 This is the thing.

281
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,720
 Oh, maybe this is just because I downloaded it a Reno and it had things in it.

282
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,800
 And so I was like, oh, sometimes this has things in it.

283
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,720
 One of the things about the Hugo voter packet is that the best

284
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:25,000
 fancast download is quite large and those who are not fully plugged into the Hugo

285
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,440
 or the may not know that Best Fancast is the lowest participated category.

286
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,400
 And if you get the less than 25% of the ballots cast a vote in your category,

287
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,720
 your category does not run.

288
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,680
 And I think we're all a little bit worried that having a really big file

289
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,120
 in the voter packet will exacerbate that problem.

290
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,840
 How big is the best fancast download?

291
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,600
 It's really big, it's monumentally big, it is 2.9 gigabytes.

292
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,200
 And many, many Hugo voters probably are still using computer

293
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,240
 file systems that won't cope with the single file larger than two gigabytes.

294
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,480
 And in fact, some of the reports of this going wrong, I suspect that's what's

295
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,320
 gone wrong with it.

296
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,560
 It's 2.1 rather than 2.9.

297
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,720
 I should say, I found that my problem with it is it downloads like it's being

298
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,440
 down it over like some kind of tin can telephone or something.

299
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:28,440
 I have fast internet and it took half an hour to get a 2 gig file, which is pretty

300
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,120
 ridiculous for me.

301
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,920
 Oh, you're lucky.

302
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,000
 What hour alas, we used to watch as the four megabytes came in and we were

303
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
 not, we were proud of that.

304
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,680
 We were so thrilled.

305
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,920
 That's what we call broad bad.

306
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,840
 Sorry, I got off for one again.

307
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
 You've gone off on one and I started with the 28K modem.

308
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,400
 So I was like, oh, you were lucky.

309
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,840
 I started with two chink cans of piece of string.

310
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,640
 But yes, it is a big file.

311
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,000
 And for me, it down extremely slowly and there were reports that the

312
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,760
 download didn't finish.

313
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,000
 So I think there might be two issues.

314
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,360
 One is that the file is too big.

315
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,640
 And the second is that I don't know what to try kind of hosting it on, but it's

316
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,320
 not working that well everywhere.

317
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,920
 But anyway, our download was the smallest.

318
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,680
 Best fancast is always a big download because fancast

319
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,360
 are MP3 files, and they're quite big.

320
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,880
 And I think our download was the smallest of the six.

321
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,720
 So we are now polishing our laurels, but we think it would be good to split this

322
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,120
 up or make it offer for the Hugo voter packet team to make it easier for people

323
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,360
 to get these files if they're interested in, or maybe to have separate downloads.

324
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,800
 It is just the supporting material and point people at the original podcasts

325
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,800
 for the files, because all of this stuff is available for free on the

326
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,560
 internet. So anyway, that's actually because full confession listeners, I don't

327
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,720
 tend to listen to the fancast.

328
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,000
 Not only is by downloading the sip file, I tend to subscribe to them in my podcast

329
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,800
 player and download like the episodes they have put in the packet.

330
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,880
 So I would quite like there to be two versions of the download, which is one,

331
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,720
 which is just here are the episodes they included and any ancillary materials

332
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,560
 they put in.

333
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,840
 And the other one be the MP3s because I don't need the MP3s.

334
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,160
 They're on the internet already.

335
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,920
 And I listen to things in my podcast player, so I'm going to listen to a podcast in

336
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,600
 my podcast player. I might as well listen to it as a podcast, if that makes any

337
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,200
 sense at all. Hopefully it does.

338
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,360
 I mean, I would say I would say I would have thought we should be smaller than

339
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,480
 stuff like best related work where some of the works will be kind of big PDFs.

340
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,520
 Because like a PDF or or best graphic novel, because I feel like a PDF of a graphic

341
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,640
 novel should be bigger than than four MP3 files from like a podcast.

342
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,600
 But maybe I am wrong.

343
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,120
 This is also an issue for best for the graphic novel category.

344
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,520
 Yes, it is.

345
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,080
 Although for those who have not looked at the whole run of Kieran Gillan's

346
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,080
 Dye series up to this point is in there and very worth having a look at.

347
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,240
 I mean, I honestly think the essays in the back are better than the comic,

348
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,320
 but that might just be me.

349
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,360
 You are way off-tropping now.

350
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,480
 I completely understand why this has happened.

351
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,960
 And like, I'm sure that once we raise it as a thing, like things will happen.

352
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,520
 That mean it's better.

353
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,920
 And I think that's how it should be.

354
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,960
 But just like kind of wanted to sort of channel out a little bit on the podcast.

355
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,440
 But yeah, and the people who do this, like I have been fortunate enough that the

356
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,040
 entire time I've been paying attention to the Hugo's, there has been a Hugo

357
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,440
 voter packet and it is like borderline miraculous.

358
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,040
 Like I get so much great stuff from my Worldcom membership every year.

359
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,280
 And like, that's not why I buy Worldcom memberships.

360
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,960
 But like I am not complaining.

361
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,200
 It is 10 out of 10 initiative and the community does a great job with every year

362
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,040
 for like a lot of work and very little recognition.

363
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,840
 So yes, thank you to the people involved.

364
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,320
 Yeah, all of that.

365
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,600
 And obviously they're way better than those yahoos from last year.

366
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,920
 Oh, yeah, definitely.

367
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,560
 without you. Ha, ha, ha!

368
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,240
 *dramatic music*

369
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,480
 Na-na na, na-na na na na, na-na Ba-las!

370
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,160
 Did that make any sense?

371
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,920
 No, because there should...

372
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,200
 ...gearly be the Lizbat.

373
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,400
 The Lizbat?

374
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,060
 Is that like a 1-bat?

375
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,640
 It's used to play Liz?

376
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,300
 Na, na, na na, na na na, na-na na na, Lizbat!

377
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,180
 Oh, cos my name, guys. Cause my name...

378
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,240
 Oh yeah!

379
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,880
 Cos her surname's Batty.

380
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,560
 That means...

381
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,760
 I'm so sorry, Liz.

382
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,040
 Jesus.

383
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,040
 Despite this being Wistwis Constitution Corner, I actually had nothing to do with putting this one in the show notes.

384
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,680
 So...

385
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,960
 I only put it in cos it was kind of interesting.

386
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,840
 But I mean, it might not be kind of interesting.

387
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,400
 No, it's kind of interesting, but...

388
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,600
 ...someone else put it in and I just want to explain it.

389
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,680
 Cos I didn't actually come up with this one.

390
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,960
 Oh, I should start explaining it then, which is Kevin Stanley,

391
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,160
 um, posted a tweet saying,

392
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,680
 "The election to select the 2024 NASVIC North American South Fiction Convention

393
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,120
 will happen at the 2023 NASVIC, not the 2023 WILCOME.

394
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,840
 Only members of the 2023 NASVIC will be able to vote on where the 2024 NASVIC will be.

395
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,280
 If you don't believe me, read the Wistwis Constitution."

396
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,720
 And I went, "I do not know that. That was...

397
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,600
 That surprised me. That was a die-I learned thing for me."

398
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,320
 At which point?

399
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,280
 I did at this point point out that this was also true at Dublin

400
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:33,120
 because obviously New Zealand and Dublin were two overseas World Cons in a row.

401
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,520
 And so the NASVIC vote in 2019 was not at the Worldcon.

402
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,160
 And so I already knew this.

403
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
 But...

404
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,400
 But yes, it is, I think, something people forget because it...

405
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,640
 I mean, and to be fair, in people's defense, it is a relatively rare thing.

406
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,280
 There haven't been that many consecutive overseas Worldcon pairs.

407
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,320
 It's getting more common, obviously, now.

408
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,040
 But yeah.

409
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,560
 As I am going, have the previously ever been a consecutive pair of overseas Worldcons

410
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,000
 before Dublin and Cons Zealand.

411
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,320
 I don't think so.

412
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,760
 Probably not now.

413
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,120
 So this was news before we started doing the podcast.

414
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,240
 I mean, technically, yes, if Montreal.

415
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,280
 It doesn't.

416
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,360
 Because that doesn't count because it's still North American.

417
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,480
 So in that case, I think the answer is no.

418
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,200
 So we could have noticed this in 2019, or no doubt.

419
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,400
 John did notice it in 2019, but I did not.

420
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,160
 Because I was not paying a lot of attention to the NASFIC then.

421
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,120
 I know it's come up in conversation before now, though, because...

422
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,640
 Because of the idea that it would be quite funny to stuff the ballad at a Worldcon

423
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,480
 to get the NASFIC to go to Jersey.

424
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,760
 Is that there must be something in the Wusswiz Constitution

425
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,120
 that says the NASFIC has to be in North America, surely?

426
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,960
 Yes, because I'm pretty sure there is a list of what defines North America

427
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,600
 in the Wusswiz Constitution.

428
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,080
 Yes, I think we were actually thinking of putting it

429
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,760
 into some US overseas territory that is not very close to the United States.

430
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,280
 I think something like you can put it in like

431
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,240
 Sampier and Michelan, something like that.

432
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:10,640
 Like somewhere that is basically quite awkward to get to from most of North America.

433
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,640
 So technically, so this means that technically you could hold a NASFIC in France.

434
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,280
 Is one of those places technically France?

435
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,520
 Yes.

436
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,800
 Nice.

437
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,920
 Sampier and Michelan is a French territory.

438
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,200
 Nice.

439
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,080
 Kind of what I'm finding on the internet.

440
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,840
 It's not like I'm intimately familiar with all the French overseas territories or anything like that.

441
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,600
 I presume someone put that in just to stop people arguing about it at Wusswiz business meetings.

442
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,120
 Yeah, I think you're probably right.

443
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,480
 Pics this week, I am picking Sci-Fi London, specifically the short film programs of Sci-Fi London,

444
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:02,280
 which are basically they do Sci-Fi London in London at the Picture House Stratford every year.

445
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,800
 And they have started putting the short film selections online.

446
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,720
 They did this first in the pandemic and then they've carried it on this year, which is great.

447
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,800
 And for the French, these are 12 rounds.

448
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,240
 You get about 10 hours of short film, which is a great value.

449
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:24,120
 So I went to the show notes, say, I know what my pick, this is, it's going to be the Sci-Fi London short films, which John told me to watch.

450
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,960
 And so I went to find it to the pics and I was like, Oh, no, not again.

451
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,560
 But this time, I think John clearly just have the moral high ground.

452
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,480
 And so I have not picked that.

453
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,600
 Anyway, tell us about the short films, John.

454
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,960
 I have watched two and a half of the five streams because there was a problem with the website yesterday

455
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,920
 and I was going to watch the others last yesterday afternoon.

456
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,760
 And was unable to, sadly, but it's fixed today.

457
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,280
 So I'll be watching the others today and tomorrow.

458
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,920
 There are five programs of shorts.

459
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,520
 The first one is strain in the brain.

460
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
 The second one is our robot overlords.

461
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,560
 The third one is all you can eat alien buffet.

462
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,400
 The fourth one is artificial insolence.

463
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,320
 And the fifth one is the future's orried.

464
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,840
 They're quite tenuous.

465
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,880
 There are definitely films where I'm like, why was that not in one of the other programs?

466
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,840
 I don't understand why it's in this one.

467
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,680
 I will say in general, shorts program one and two, I thought the overall quality was quite a bit lower than it was last year.

468
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,960
 But I don't know whether that's kind of just because I've got rose tinted glasses for last year or whether

469
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,240
 because they just weren't really my cup of tea.

470
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,400
 A couple of the standouts I've watched so far were St.

471
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,520
 Android, which I really thoroughly enjoyed and teacher, which was was very good.

472
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,800
 And those are both in the our robot overlords program.

473
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:53,920
 And then in the stream in the brain program, there was one called subscribed, which I liked a lot.

474
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,960
 Oh, and there's one called Thank You, which was amazing.

475
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,320
 I'm fascinated by the idea that you went through the streams because we kind of went, well, oh, they've organized them into streams.

476
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,000
 So these are things that are automatically linked.

477
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 So we will watch the first film from stream one and then the second film from stream two.

478
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,240
 They're the third film from stream three and so on.

479
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,040
 So that we actually get variety in our short films.

480
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,720
 But I would agree that the ones that we have seen, we've not seen quite as many as half books in quite a lot of them.

481
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,520
 I mean, I thought it was interesting as a kind of, well, how would you do short science fiction films on small budgets?

482
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,080
 I didn't think the quality was that great.

483
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,720
 There was one that I liked that I found incredibly depressing.

484
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,920
 I should have made a note of names, but I didn't.

485
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,920
 But in general, I thought that they were maybe they just aren't that many great short science fiction films being made.

486
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,840
 But I really liked the opportunity to watch them.

487
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
 I liked the variety of it.

488
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,600
 I liked the fact that somebody is taking the time to go and put together a program of short science fiction films.

489
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,960
 I get it out there on the internet because I think that's a very worthy and good thing to be doing.

490
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,880
 It kind of made me go, oh, you know, for all you have to do to make a short science fiction film is film somebody.

491
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,160
 Wefting on a bit in a warehouse and jiggle the camera a bit, then I think I could probably manage some of that.

492
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,560
 Maybe I should be making films.

493
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,040
 Oh, that one was crap. Sorry.

494
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,800
 That was one of the ones I really detested.

495
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:27,040
 So there is an issue with the shorts in general that a lot of the science fiction concepts in them.

496
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:37,040
 I mean, this is also a problem with science fiction at high budget and full length is that sometimes the science fiction concepts within these films are extremely old.

497
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,920
 It's a very short hat and you're getting away with it because you have lots of other things going on that are interesting.

498
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,160
 But when you do it when you do it in a very small, tight film, it becomes a lot more obvious.

499
00:32:49,160 --> 00:33:04,560
 I think this is one of the reasons why I've always found it interesting that you gravitate towards short of forms because I feel like short stories wouldn't be your jam at the moment because a lot of them, a lot of the short in the SFL programme

500
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,400
 remind me quite a lot of the short fiction I've read recently and that it's not.

501
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,520
 Yeah, it's certainly true that short fiction, short fiction, not as good as it was when I was 14.

502
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,840
 Who knew?

503
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,680
 Older member of podcast waves fished at sky news at 11.

504
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,120
 Old member of podcast goes science fiction was better when I was young.

505
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,840
 I mean, I'm not sure that's actually true.

506
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,320
 And I when we come to talk about Hugo books, I will be saying I do not think that it is in fact true.

507
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,320
 But certainly when you get short films, it kind of does bring that out a bit, especially short films on very small budgets.

508
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,200
 And there was one that was there was one called bunker that was made on a much larger budget.

509
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,200
 And we both agreed that it was very stylish and had a lot going on.

510
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
 But neither of us really think we understood it at all.

511
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,600
 And we think we might need to understand more about Australia to to understand it.

512
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,920
 So when you watch that one, you can have a think, see if you see if I'm just too stupid for it.

513
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,640
 I'm OK with you doing something which is a relatively well worn idea and doing it well.

514
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,000
 And I'm OK with you doing a really interesting idea and having some problems with execution.

515
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,400
 But if you're doing an old idea and you execute badly, that is the segment of the graph where I get annoyed.

516
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,240
 But there are some really great ones.

517
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,880
 Like there are some that I really, really enjoyed.

518
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,320
 So, you know, I'm in an in general, I'm very glad to watch them again.

519
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,000
 And I'm very glad that they've put them online again.

520
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,280
 And unlike last year where they were just all in alphabetical order, I'm kind of glad that I get to watch them

521
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,920
 in the way the festival directors presented them.

522
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:41,000
 Unlike Alison, I don't get five new albums and listen to track one on each album and then track two on each album

523
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,040
 and then track three on each album for the variety because I think brings together artistically, probably.

524
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:52,120
 Probably don't know how I listen to music because basically they've been to shuffle about 15 years ago

525
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,760
 and my life was transformed.

526
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,560
 Different presentations of ADHD, Ursula.

527
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,720
 Do not diagnose yourself based on a podcast.

528
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,400
 That's just good advice.

529
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,520
 So, Alison, what was your pick?

530
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,880
 So my pick and I haven't watched all of it yet, but my pick is Severance.

531
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,680
 And I have to I have to say, Severance is a I think it's eight or 10 episode.

532
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,000
 Apple TV plus drama series.

533
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,720
 So I'm afraid it's another good thing on Apple TV plus guys.

534
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,760
 Just get it for a month, watch all the good stuff.

535
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,720
 I'd let it go again.

536
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:29,760
 A series and the thing about this is that the premise of this series doesn't become clear until about two thirds of the way through the first episode.

537
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,760
 So if that's the sort of thing that bothers you, a, don't watch the trailer and and be about to spoil.

538
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:42,040
 So I just say to John, please watch the first episode of Severance because I know that he would have to edit the podcast.

539
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,360
 And I knew I know that he's very first to spoilers of this kind.

540
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:54,440
 So with that amount of warning, the premise is that they've taken non disclosure agreements to a greater degree.

541
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,520
 And we have a world here in which you have an outside world where you are not at work.

542
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,080
 And you have an inside world where you work.

543
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:09,040
 And the and your brain has had an implant put in it with some hand wavy,

544
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,960
 science magic.

545
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,160
 I do not think that is ever going to get completely explained.

546
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,640
 It's not that sort of show.

547
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:26,600
 So that you do not remember anything about being at work when you're not at work and you do not remember anything about being not at work when you're at work and your life is completely separated.

548
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,600
 And there are lots of things I really, really like about this show and I haven't seen the whole thing yet.

549
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:44,120
 So a couple of things I wanted to specifically mention is that the aesthetic of the workplace is fantastically produced.

550
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:51,480
 So they've created this kind of absolutely horrifying office where you aren't quite sure what you're doing,

551
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,600
 but there are a lot of weird corridors and you're working in very small groups of people.

552
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,200
 And there are some people who seem to know what's going on, but you're not really one of them,

553
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:08,960
 but you're there all the time and people get used probably to the fact that they are actually stuck there,

554
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,880
 that the person outside has made this decision that they're going to be stuck.

555
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,560
 In the world, this slightly reminded me of the episode of Black Mirror,

556
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:26,280
 where somebody has made a clone of themselves to do all the boring parts of their life in thinky space.

557
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:35,400
 So it is playing with some of the same sorts of ideas about what it is reasonable to get parts of your consciousness to do.

558
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,200
 I very much, I think your point about the implant will never find out how it works.

559
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:47,560
 I think that is true. I think for me, the best science fiction is something that assumes that something is possible,

560
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:53,960
 that is not necessarily possible, and then extrapolate what the ramifications of that might be.

561
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:01,000
 And I think, I think, kind of, I don't mind there being a McGuffin, if that, you know, the show is being, I think,

562
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,440
 from, I've seen the first two episodes, I really like how the show is portraying the world in which this is possible.

563
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:17,880
 And like, I really like how it's portraying the way the employer treats it, and the way that the people around the central character who has had this process done,

564
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,080
 treat the process and treat him as a result.

565
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:28,680
 I think it is, and I really like the exploration of like, what might make you do it, if it was an option.

566
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,320
 I think, I think these are all things that are being done very well and in a way I find very, very compelling.

567
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,440
 Both the worlds, both the interior world is very stylised, and it is amazingly so,

568
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,520
 but the exterior world is also pretty strange. You know, there are some very odd things about it.

569
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:55,800
 There are odd characters, there are odd, it's the actual town in which this is set feels a little bit like twin peaks in terms of having that sense of

570
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,800
 slight detachment from anything you might reasonably expect things to be.

571
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:12,360
 This premise was completely new to me, but I have since that obviously there are stories in the canon that deal with it, it's not absolutely new, but it was completely new to me.

572
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:18,440
 When you're talking about Alison, you don't like science fiction because you keep going, well I've seen all these ideas before.

573
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,800
 I hadn't seen this one, hadn't really seen this treated it this way.

574
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:28,200
 This is hitting all of my a novel idea done interestingly and well buttons in a good way.

575
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:35,320
 And I recommend it firmly despite the fact I haven't seen all of it yet, and I'm slightly worried it's going to spiral out of control and become light lost.

576
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:41,720
 So I have seen all of it, there are nine episodes John, not six or eight or ten.

577
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:53,720
 I did really enjoy it and I'm not bothered that it doesn't really explain the how, but I do feel without getting into these photos that the first series does not actually spend enough time on the why,

578
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:07,560
 as in it doesn't get, for me it did not get to a satisfactory point where I felt the first series should end, it just gets to a good point, but it's like, I was a bit like, okay, so now I'm just waiting for series two where you will explain more of what is going on.

579
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:16,520
 I mean I think it becomes obvious in the first episode that whatever they're doing is something weird, you know, they're not doing it because work life is boring and you may wish to detach yourself from it.

580
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:26,760
 They've got some other motive going on and I wasn't satisfied with how that kind of resolved itself in the first series, but there are some very satisfying things about it.

581
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,520
 And I thought John Turturo and Christopher Walken are, I really like them.

582
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,880
 Yes, 100%.

583
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,200
 They've got a lot of good character actors in it doing interesting things.

584
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:47,560
 Well, and also so I want to say that I think Adam Scott is also amazing in it. Adam Scott is in Parks and Recreation season three onwards.

585
00:40:47,560 --> 00:41:02,600
 He plays Ben and he's been in other things. He was in a show called Ghosted, which kind of touches on some of the same themes as this starring him and Craig Robinson who plays the Pontiac Bandit in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

586
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:19,320
 Scott plays a mathematician whose wife has gone missing and Robinson plays a cop who is kind of being roped into investigate paranormal things and they get thrown together and it's kind of like a buddy comedy kind of thing, opposite subtract.

587
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:30,920
 The woman playing Heli in Severance played Scott's ex-wife in Ghosted, but the other thing I want to say is Apple TV Plus has a lot of good sci-fi on it now.

588
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,440
 Like, "Hoho!" Like, because I like, I know everyone loves for all mankind, but I like for all mankind quite a lot.

589
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,720
 It's got this, which I very much like and it's got a few other bits and bobs on that are quite good.

590
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:57,160
 I mean, I haven't seen Foundation. I know it wasn't universally well reviewed, but you know, I just quite like that there's a lot of this super well done, super interesting, I think quite hard science fiction being made.

591
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,920
 And I am here for it listeners. I am very much enjoying their output.

592
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:26,200
 Well, given that Amazon Prime is also doing a lot of really interesting essay, is bankrolling a lot of really interesting SF, I feel like we're in a time where possibly because nerds have a lot of money now, a lot of money is being put into vastly more thoughtful SF than traditionally was available, especially in television.

593
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,960
 But also movies. And I really like it.

594
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:36,280
 I don't think it's that there's a, I don't think that they have lots more money. It's just that there is just vastly more television.

595
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:46,040
 Yes, because there's also like, stuff like Made for Love and like a few other things coming out of HBO that are really, really interesting as well.

596
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:53,880
 And so I do think that the amount of just good sci-fi is generally higher than it has been for a while, which I'm excited about.

597
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,800
 Uh, Liz, do you have a pick this week?

598
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,160
 No.

599
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,120
 Cool. That was the Octa Thought podcast. And it's goodbye from me.

600
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,240
 It's goodbye from me. And it's goodbye from me.

601
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:27,880
 [Music]

602
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:34,760
 I'm busy and then when I'm busy all I do is watch like Bob's Burgers and reread Book Color Really Red.

603
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,200
 So tell us about Bob's Burgers. What's Bob's Burgers?

604
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,560
 You've Ag of what? Okay. So this is the after show.

605
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,160
 What's Bob's Burgers?

606
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,520
 Bob's Burgers is an animated show by the people that make Central Park on Apple TV Plus.

607
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,080
 And it's a bit like that without the songs and a bit weirder.

608
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,800
 And it's very good. I like Bob's Burgers.

609
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,200
 Um, I'll watch Central Park first then.

610
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:03,480
 Central Park is genuinely great. It's, I do adore it. I get from Liz's head tilt. She might be less.

611
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,840
 I can't get into it. So I can't get into Central Park. I don't know why, but I do like Bob's Burgers.

612
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,440
 Fair enough.

613
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,320
 Yeah. So it's my current like I need to watch something for half an hour that will be good

614
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,280
 and not too taxing. And so I put on Bob's Burgers.

615
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,720
 Is it genre?

616
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,120
 No.

617
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,760
 Yeah.

618
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,320
 Oh.

619
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,320
 It's about a guy who runs a burger shop and his kids and his wife.

620
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,000
 His name's Bob.

621
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,920
 It has a lot of puns in it.

622
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,440
 In the background.

623
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:37,640
 Not so much in the text of the show. And it's very good. It is. I like it a lot.

624
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,480
 The one I just watched is set at, you know, what is obviously their version of a

625
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,080
 my little Pony convention full of bronies. Which is quite funny.

626
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:53,400
 There's a movie coming out. There's a movie out today, I think in the UK, or like maybe last week.

627
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,720
 But we're not up to date. And also we sort of figured it's a sort of movie that probably works

628
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,240
 just as well on streaming. So we might wait for that.

629
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,320
 It might even be the sort of movie where if you go see it in a cinema, you can see the

630
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,440
 pixels move, which always winds me up.

631
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,680
 I'd be, I'd be surprised.

632
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,800
 This is probably something from the past when my kids were growing up,

633
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,800
 quite a lot of the movies that were able to children.

634
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,160
 If you were to see them in the cinema, you could see the pixels, which I always thought was a bit

635
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,800
 shit.

636
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,040
 No, I mean, that does sound very, very annoying.

637
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,680
 I don't think Bob's Burgers is aimed at children.

638
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,400
 I don't know.

639
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,600
 I might be wrong.

640
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,640
 No, I don't think so.

641
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:33,880
 It's quite a lot about middle age, I would say. Maybe.

642
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,720
 Maybe not. I don't know.

643
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,440
 Oh, I should definitely, yeah, no, that's what I need. I need more

644
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,440
 depressing shows about middle age.

645
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,520
 Yeah, it's not depressing, I don't think.

646
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,800
 Unless you think about it too hard, in which case maybe, but that's often true.

647
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,280
 Everything's depressing if you let it watch a middle age.

648
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,720
