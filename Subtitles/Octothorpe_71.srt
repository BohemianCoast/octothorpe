1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 - John was frozen. - He has.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,560
 That's why he's not mocking us.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,280
 He's got a kind of...

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,480
 It's got an interesting look he's got on his face.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,920
 I'm going to screenshot it for him.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,080
 Yeah, we're the screenshot for sure.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,880
 Yeah. I wonder when he'll come back on.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,360
 Yeah, it's gone away though, yeah.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:16,880
 Hmm.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,920
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 71st episode of Octa Thorpe,

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,840
 the podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,640
 This episode is coming to you on the 24th of November 2022.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,760
 I'm John Coxon.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,880
 I'm Alison Scott.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
 And I'm Liz Batty.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,800
 We did get some letters of comment

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,600
 and the first one is from a man named Christopher J. Garcia.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,880
 He says,

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,000
 "Dame it, Coxon. Where are the graphs? I was promised graphs."

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,440
 And this time I do categorically promise that there will be graphs.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,880
 Have you done them already?

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,520
 No.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
 Then don't categorically promise.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,760
 Categorically promise that there will be graphs.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,160
 Chris also said that the Hugo ceremony is way too short

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,080
 and it could definitely go longer.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,520
 I think Chris may be the only person in the world who believes that.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,600
 I would be interested to know if Chris's perspective is skewed

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
 from usually being a nominee.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
 Like if you're a nominee,

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,560
 do you want the experience to last longer?

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,840
 And if you're not a nominee,

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
 you want to get it all over with so you can find out

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
 who won best novel and go to bar.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,680
 No, Alison.

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,160
 No, I mean, we were finalists this year

37
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,280
 and I would have been entirely happy for the ceremony to be noticeably shorter.

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,840
 No, it was alright.

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
 I didn't think it was overly long.

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
 Chris also says he lives about 30 minutes for the beach

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
 but doesn't like swimming in the ocean

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,000
 because it has great white sharks, jellyfish and surfers.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,720
 Yeah, to be fair, I'm going to speak

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,080
 but probably not going to swim in the ocean

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,400
 because it's not a particularly nice ocean swimming beach

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,920
 and it does have jellyfish

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,320
 but I will walk along the shore and panel my feet in and so on.

48
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,840
 Anyone else got anything on Chris?

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,280
 He'd like to give more awards,

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,120
 best dramatic presentation audio, best game and best cat.

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,320
 Badger just winning a Hugo every year would be great

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,720
 but I'm not sure we could just make Badger our own Hugo.

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,320
 Can we have a Badger badge?

54
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,520
 Can we have a Badger badge?

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,600
 Can we have a Badger's best cat badge?

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,880
 Yeah, definitely.

57
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,080
 Also onto Esther.

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,880
 He also says, "Space shuttles are okay.

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,720
 Mars rovers are much cooler.

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160
 I've actually licked one continuing the pattern

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,600
 of Chris having a much more interesting life to me."

62
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,680
 And he also says he's got 32 and a half megabytes of zines

63
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,360
 over the last 15 years, which is quite a lot

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
 although less than I would have guessed.

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
 I mean, is that just a text file?

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,400
 Because that doesn't seem like a lot of zine, right?

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,720
 Can't be like full issues of journey planet or anything.

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
 Chris, write in and clarify.

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,880
 "I've edited journey planets that were bigger than that."

70
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,760
 Maybe that decimal points in the wrong place.

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,800
 That would make a lot more sense

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
 because there would be 32 and a half gigabytes

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
 and I think that might be right.

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
 Yeah, that sounds a lot more likely, yeah.

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
 Oh, yeah, that makes more sense.

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,760
 Okay, we also heard from Phara Mendelssohn who said,

77
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
 "Oh, Pemicon is the NASFIC."

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,520
 You never actually said, that is correct.

79
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,640
 We should have said.

80
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
 So Pemicon is the NASFIC.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
 Thank you for pointing that out, Phara.

82
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,160
 And we can confirm that Phara was in New Orleans

83
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,200
 as a support for Karen Fishick's big,

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
 Phara is taking on the roles of communications and tourism.

85
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
 And possibly very helpful synergy there

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,120
 with all the other conventions that are happening in Birmingham.

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,920
 Yes.

88
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,880
 Get some good tourist guys going and you've got the tourists guys done.

89
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,160
 This segues neatly into Raj's tweet

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,400
 where Raj says that they're not going to the Eastercon in Birmingham,

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
 but they are going to satellite eight and worldcon.

92
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
 So we will see you at worldcon, Raj.

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,600
 Worldcon 2024, presumably, Raj.

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:05,840
 Yes.

95
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,880
 Worldcon 2023.

96
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,400
 Yeah, we will definitely see you then.

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
 I probably won't be at satellite eight following a long tradition of me

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
 never quite getting to satellite.

99
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,720
 Sorry, guys.

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,400
 It's a very long way from London.

101
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,680
 Oh, so you go to Scotland for worldcon, but not any other con.

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
 It's complicated.

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,560
 Conversely, I might will be at satellite eight because it's quite close.

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,280
 Oh, yeah.

105
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,120
 Equally, I didn't know.

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,480
 It's not on their website yet.

107
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,720
 So I can't, I don't think I can join yet.

108
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,640
 No, they were definitely taking memberships this weekend.

109
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,720
 There were several conventions at,

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,480
 they've gone there for shadowing.

111
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,200
 But speaking of Winnipeg, which we were before,

112
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,040
 John Segway'd away from it,

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,480
 I'm not sure if we mentioned the TAF race last time,

114
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,720
 but even if we did, we can mention it again,

115
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,640
 because fandom needs a few good people.

116
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,800
 And by that, a few good people, I mean, at least two,

117
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
 and you do not have to be good.

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
 We would like to have a TAF race.

119
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,720
 Well, the TAF administration was like to have a TAF race.

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,440
 It's going to be East West Race to go to Pemecon 2023.

121
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
 Yeah, I think this is a really great opportunity,

122
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,920
 because one of the things about worldcon is that they're enormous.

123
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,960
 And you as the TAF delegate probably get a bit lost in the crowd.

124
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,480
 Whereas I think at NASFIC,

125
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,280
 it's going to be a convention of exactly right size

126
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,440
 to have a really, really good time as a delegate.

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
 And don't just go to Winnipeg,

128
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,680
 go to other places in North America as well,

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
 at somebody else's expense.

130
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,160
 Yeah, so if you're listening to this,

131
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
 and you've always wanted to run for TAF,

132
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,600
 and you are European or resident in the UK and Europe,

133
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
 this is your chance.

134
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,680
 Is it a flip?

135
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
 Have we flipped the direction of races?

136
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,920
 We're doing two Westbound races.

137
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,720
 So we did Westbound to Chicon,

138
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,960
 and we are going Eastbound to Glasgow,

139
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
 rather than having an Eastbound rate to conversation.

140
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,480
 I see.

141
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,040
 They're going Westbound to Pemecon,

142
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,960
 and then Eastbound to Glasgow.

143
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
 I mean Canada's very nice,

144
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
 so I'm thinking I might run.

145
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
 Haven't you won TAF already, John?

146
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,600
 Yeah, but it's more of a guideline than an actual rule.

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
 Yeah, you just try running and see what happens.

148
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,720
 That's my plan.

149
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,040
 I'm still waiting for Chris Garcia to launch his Duff campaign,

150
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,840
 Chris for TAF 2 this time for Duff.

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,320
 Which I think will be very good.

152
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,280
 If John did run it would probably kindle in a fan-ish outrage

153
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,360
 to get a lot of donations to whoever was running against John.

154
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,120
 Yeah, I'm basically just doing the fan fund a massive solid.

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,640
 I'm an altruist, Liz.

156
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,440
 Maybe not the best way of raising money for the fan funds.

157
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,760
 Yeah, by massive solid you mean a great big enormous...

158
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,440
 There was also a tweet of comment from Peter Sullivan,

159
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
 who notes that Space Shuttle Enterprise is actually named after itself,

160
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,400
 because in Star Trek, the ship that Captain Kirk captions is named after

161
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,600
 the Space Shuttle Enterprise,

162
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,920
 and when they were naming the Space Channels,

163
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,320
 they called one of the Enterprise after the ship from Star Trek.

164
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,800
 So it is one huge recursive loop in the great tradition of good time travel stories.

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
 Johnny Badley wrote twice in the Facebook page,

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
 wants to say, "There's a Canadian embassy, did you know?"

167
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
 And in fact, I did know that because it's the picture I used for my art references for that cartoon.

168
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,560
 And he would like a best publisher Hugo category,

169
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
 which I think is not a bad idea,

170
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
 to reward the publisher who put out the most interesting,

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
 new exciting or republished out of print books,

172
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,080
 or was in general the most interesting genre publisher.

173
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,800
 Doesn't Locust have a best publisher category?

174
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 Yeah, but Locust is about to go out of business,

175
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,760
 so we should probably get on with finding a replacement for their awards, right?

176
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,800
 Ooh...

177
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
 Not for podcast!

178
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,200
 Apparently, apparently that is too far from his listeners,

179
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,440
 because she made a very paint set on.

180
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,280
 No, obviously it would be very sad if Locust was to go under.

181
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
 *laughs*

182
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
 It's not for podcast, go on!

183
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,080
 There's um, isn't there like a crowd funder or something at the moment?

184
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,240
 I just thought it was a bit harsh to kick them when they are, they are down,

185
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
 but they're struggling, yeah?

186
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,840
 I did have a good point if you give me one moment to look it up, which is...

187
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,880
 Oh...

188
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,040
 So the best publisher award for the Locust has been won,

189
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,200
 well, for the first 15 years of his existence it was won by...

190
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,960
 Sorry, it's had at least three winners.

191
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
 *laughs*

192
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
 That's what we like.

193
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,120
 Tor.com and...

194
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,760
 No, so the thing is it was Valentine and Valentine Del Rey,

195
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,160
 and then Pocket/Timescape for a while,

196
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,440
 and then Back to Valentine Den Rey,

197
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,960
 and then it's been Tor or Tor St Martin's since 1988.

198
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,440
 So for longer than I've been alive.

199
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
 *burps* Chon!

200
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,280
 Sorry, if it's only won by three people,

201
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,600
 and one of them has been winning for the last 33 years.

202
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,560
 Is that helpful?

203
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,080
 I don't know, I don't know if it is.

204
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
 So have a best small press award?

205
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
 Maybe that would be good, that would be good, perhaps.

206
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,080
 I looked at the vast range of books on Elswen presses stand at Novicon,

207
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
 and I was like, "When do you stop being a small press then?"

208
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,960
 Look at all these books and they said...

209
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,120
 Apparently we stop being a small press where that turnover goes over 50 billion dollars a year.

210
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,400
 So we've got a little waltz.

211
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,760
 That is, uh...

212
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,880
 That is reasonable.

213
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,000
 Quite a bottle of money.

214
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 I mean, I think if we were going to take anything from the Locust Awards

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
 that we thought should go into the Hugo's,

216
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,840
 I would probably pick something like the anthology award.

217
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,400
 Readers, write in what awards from other awards should be adopted by the Hugo's.

218
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:27,120
 I mean, I do like, I do actually quite like the way that Locust splits a novel into multiple different novel awards,

219
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
 but I think just because I like novels, I like giving them all prizes.

220
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,520
 I think if I was going to poach one, I would poach best magazine,

221
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,240
 and then I would ditch best editor short form,

222
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,640
 because you could reward it all through magazine semi-pro-scene front-scene.

223
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
 You know that Mark Plumber's going to write in again, don't you?

224
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,880
 Good.

225
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,400
 I like it when Mark writes in.

226
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,720
 I secretly say things, hoping he will.

227
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
 Because it all comes around again.

228
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,480
 Speaking of awards that have been won by four different groupings.

229
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,080
 Oh no, has it?

230
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,040
 Okay.

231
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,800
 So I can't, I think it's changed over time.

232
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
 So I'm not sure it's always been magazine or anthology.

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
 I was just looking up in the internet, but it was like it's been tour.com

234
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
 as involves FNSF and Locust.

235
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,280
 I would now, so if I was ever going to run an award,

236
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,440
 like for instance, say we did the Octa-Thought Awards,

237
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
 and there was a category for Best Podcast,

238
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
 I would make it very clear that Octa-Thought was not eligible.

239
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,240
 Yep.

240
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,320
 Because I don't want to win an award I give.

241
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,880
 Like, I have a pretty low bar for,

242
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,400
 I feel like I've not got very rigorous standards around self-motion,

243
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,520
 certainly nowhere near as much as some other people in British fandom.

244
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,920
 But like, I'm not going to give myself an award.

245
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,040
 Come on guys.

246
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,560
 Reader's writing for the first annual Octa-Thought piece,

247
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
 what should the categories be?

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,120
 Ooh.

249
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
 We are crowdsourcing these.

250
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,760
 Please also all nominate yourselves for Best Letter Hack.

251
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,560
 But obviously if you write in, there's a good chance you're going to get

252
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,280
 a nomination for Best Letter Hack, because there's not that many of you.

253
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,240
 Oh, there's literally a handful.

254
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,120
 That's loads.

255
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
 Put it this way, there are more people who would be eligible for Best Letter Hack

256
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,440
 than there are people who have won Best Publisher in the Locust Awards.

257
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,480
 It would be a more vibrant award than that.

258
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,560
 But would it be more vibrant than the purple colour of your office John?

259
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,360
 Nothing could be.

260
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,960
 Please also write in to tell us what voting system we should use

261
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,840
 for the nomination and voting system of the Octa-Thought piece,

262
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,120
 which we will then completely ignore and pick them by editorial whim.

263
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,960
 Oh, I'm thinking that the number of votes for each person,

264
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,680
 you print out that many slips of paper with that person's name on

265
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
 and you put them all in a hat and then you jiggle the hat about

266
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,720
 and you pick one at random.

267
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,480
 So everyone's still got a chance of winning.

268
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
 It's just biased in favour of the first one.

269
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,120
 It's like a worse version of First Past the Post.

270
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,840
 I'm very proud of it.

271
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,680
 That's terrible.

272
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
 That's an extraordinarily terrible voting system.

273
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,400
 It's basically a raffle.

274
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,960
 If you've got people to pay to vote as well.

275
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,000
 I'm quite proud of it given I came up with it on the fly.

276
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,280
 Because I was trying to come up with a terrible voting system

277
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,880
 and I feel like I've nailed it.

278
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,680
 You might have.

279
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,920
 So yeah, on to our main subject for today,

280
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
 which is I went to Mote Novicon.

281
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,280
 Did you guys have fun at Novicon, guys?

282
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,840
 I lovely time not being at Novicon,

283
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,880
 but I feel listeners may be more interested in your lovely time at Novicon.

284
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,280
 So maybe we should focus on that.

285
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,360
 So Novicon was back at the Buxton Palace for a second year

286
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,720
 and we've now heard it will be back again next year for a third year.

287
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,280
 Why did it leave the old hotel?

288
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,400
 Sorry, I forgot.

289
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,360
 Can you explain that?

290
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,240
 The left the old hotel because Covid.

291
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,480
 Because they were using it as a coronavirus court.

292
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,440
 They were using it as a temporary court to catch up with the backlog.

293
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,040
 It was a Nightingale court.

294
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,000
 Ah, okay.

295
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,120
 Yes, and they couldn't host Novicon 50 there

296
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
 and I guess that means that they're not going to go back.

297
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,560
 So when they had Nightingale hospitals,

298
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,440
 I think everyone was like,

299
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,720
 "Oh, Nightingale hospitals."

300
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
 They're called that because of Florence Nightingale being a famed nurse.

301
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,240
 But of course, it turns out that it's actually Nightingale anything

302
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,320
 and it's because Florence Nightingale was actually a famed water-timer

303
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,720
 administrator who was very good at setting up things at short notice.

304
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,200
 That's what happened to the old hotel and they moved

305
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,520
 and having moved, they decided they liked

306
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,160
 being in the center of a really nice town

307
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,240
 that's the right size to be in the center of when you're at a convention.

308
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,840
 And they really liked the public areas of the hotel, which are amazing.

309
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,720
 The rooms at the Buxton Palace are a kind of mixed bag.

310
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,520
 Our room this year had a double bed in it,

311
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,400
 which sounds fine until you realize that we normally have a room with it.

312
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,600
 We normally sleep in a room with a super king bed inside it.

313
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,520
 So it was kind of far more intimate than my husband and I are used to.

314
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,000
 Hello.

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
 And there was no heating.

316
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,880
 The heating didn't work.

317
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,960
 There was hot water the first morning we were there and there after.

318
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,920
 We had to basically crack the ice on the bath, had there been a bath,

319
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
 which they wasn't.

320
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,280
 So it was very cold.

321
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,960
 I quite like it cold.

322
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,640
 I woke up after they fixed the heating,

323
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,840
 I woke up in the middle of the light thinking I was suffering from a terrible fever.

324
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,480
 But I wasn't.

325
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,160
 I was just, I just wrapped up in the way that you do if you're in a hotel.

326
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,200
 They were working, eating.

327
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,760
 The public spaces of the Buxton Palace are amazing in that not only do they have quite

328
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,080
 a lot of quite nice function rooms as a right sort of space,

329
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,280
 but they have a couple of bars and also quite a lot of sofas just randomly

330
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,760
 strewn around the hotel in different places.

331
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,320
 So I quite like sitting around on sofas all weekend.

332
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,280
 So I like hotels that have lots of sofas for me to do that.

333
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,400
 Back at the palace next year, it's a Britannia hotel.

334
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,840
 They had actually improved that last year I was worried I might die walking up or down the steps.

335
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,640
 Outside the lead from the hotel to Buxton.

336
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,040
 And this year they've got some new lighting on them.

337
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,320
 So presumably either they suddenly decided that would be a good thing to

338
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,600
 spend some maintenance money on or somebody sued one of those.

339
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,080
 So that is that your Novacom reporter in nutshell,

340
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,840
 last year thought I might die this year just nearly froze today?

341
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,960
 Novacom, the UK's second convention.

342
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,600
 It actually has on the website the UK's longest running

343
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,960
 science fiction convention, which I think is a bit of a bloody cheek actually.

344
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,160
 I know what they read.

345
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,520
 Sort of.

346
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,160
 Yeah.

347
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
 If you real squint.

348
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,040
 It's kind of always run by the same people, but obviously it's not the same people.

349
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,080
 Basically sort of if you lie.

350
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,320
 So are we not counting Easticon because it's in different places, different people or what?

351
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,560
 Well it actually says the UK's longest established science fiction convention.

352
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,480
 So what we are actually arguing is whether or not Easticon is established.

353
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,280
 And I don't know how you define established to mean that Easticon isn't but Novacom is.

354
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,120
 Yeah, you don't. It's nonsense.

355
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
 Novacom was lovely.

356
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,880
 The public areas of the hotel are so nice that it rather makes up for everything else.

357
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,520
 The rooms were not actually bad apart from being a bit cold,

358
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,960
 which was not entirely anybody's fault.

359
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,080
 The hotel did.

360
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,400
 Worked extremely hard to get the heating back working again.

361
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,800
 And they were just very unlucky that they had very great difficulty getting a heating

362
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
 engineer in who could sort it.

363
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,200
 And they were very lucky in that the total climate catastrophe that is going to destroy

364
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:10,160
 all of our lives in short order meant that it was the warmest mid-November weekend on record this weekend.

365
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,240
 So there's a wall that's called as all that.

366
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,880
 There are even more lovely brew pubs and little craft pubs with interesting beer

367
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,000
 and nice restaurants all within about five minute walk of the hotel than they were last year.

368
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,640
 Though I think if you want to go to one of the nicest restaurants,

369
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,720
 it is best to book before the Novacom weekend because as they said

370
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,040
 to one person, "Oh, we have had a lot of large bookings for Saturday night already."

371
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,760
 And the banquet was quite good, which after last year's banquet,

372
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,560
 which was one of the worst convention backwhits I'd ever been to,

373
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
 and I've seen a few doozies.

374
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,360
 It was pretty good this year, so that was quite nice.

375
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,240
 The food was good.

376
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,800
 It was hot.

377
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,760
 There was plenty of it.

378
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,840
 It was people were not allowed to serve themselves.

379
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,800
 That being the problem.

380
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,920
 I was in the dealer's room.

381
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
 The dealer's room was small but perfectly formed.

382
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,840
 It had several conventions, including satellite,

383
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,360
 which we've already mentioned.

384
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
 Core flew crack, which we have not mentioned enough yet,

385
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,520
 but which is in Belfast in the week before the Eastergone.

386
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,240
 I want to say something about satellite,

387
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,400
 which is that if you go directly to the likely URL for the convention being

388
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,080
 satellite, sorry, 8.satellitex.org.uk,

389
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,280
 the website is there.

390
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,360
 But if you go to satellitex.org.uk, the link to it isn't.

391
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,800
 So you just have to extrapolate that it exists and go there directly.

392
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,360
 We will put a link in the show notes.

393
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,000
 Satellite had a game at the convention in the dealer's room,

394
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,880
 which consisted of throwing sperm into a bucket.

395
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,440
 And I thought this was an odd choice.

396
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,680
 Did you have to provide your own sperm?

397
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,120
 They were saying, "Start life on earth."

398
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,680
 Right. Okay.

399
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,920
 Now, I may just have a biology degree,

400
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
 but I'm not sure life on earth actually started

401
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,760
 when someone threw some sperm into a bucket.

402
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,520
 Although there is that episode of Star Trek,

403
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,280
 where it's all about that like galactic panespermia hypothesis or whatever.

404
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,160
 But even then, I'm not sure there was an actual bucket.

405
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,600
 Oh, before you do, I want to talk about last year's banquet.

406
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,480
 Last year's banquet was terrible.

407
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
 I am very glad that they fixed it this year.

408
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,400
 What was the problem last year?

409
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,000
 There was not enough food.

410
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,120
 Oh.

411
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,680
 And the food that there was wasn't amazing.

412
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,680
 And so it basically is spannier when and got a kebab

413
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,640
 before our table got our turn to go up to the table.

414
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,600
 And the kebab was much better than the banquet.

415
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,720
 It was all organic.

416
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,680
 The problem was 99% organizational.

417
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,960
 They didn't call up tables.

418
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
 So they called up the first table,

419
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,480
 and then they forgot they were supposed to be calling up tables,

420
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,840
 and everyone sat around.

421
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,040
 By the time we got there,

422
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,360
 it had all been eaten and it was called.

423
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,600
 And I took the day off to go to the banquet,

424
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,440
 and I have to do that far enough in advance.

425
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,960
 I will never do it again,

426
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,560
 because even if I turn up and they're like,

427
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,760
 "But this year it'll be fantastic."

428
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
 I'm like, "Sure, but I got work on Monday,

429
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,320
 so I'm not going."

430
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
 But didn't you take the day off to have another night

431
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
 at the convention with your friends?

432
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,360
 Well, yeah, but all my friends will be at the banquet.

433
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
 So if I don't want to go to the banquet,

434
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,760
 it's a toof of the convention will be dead,

435
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,160
 and I can go and eat a kebab on my own.

436
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,880
 I mean, to be fair,

437
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,200
 it sounds like you might have had some other takers

438
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,280
 for your kebab plan just in case.

439
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,720
 But I did see the cheesecake,

440
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,080
 and it looked quite nice, and I thought,

441
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,360
 "Ooh, cheesecake's pretty good."

442
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,120
 No, it did. It looked good.

443
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,240
 It's not a cheesecake.

444
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,680
 It was all the food was nice.

445
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,360
 But anyway, it's program.

446
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
 Did you enjoy all of the program you saw, Alison?

447
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,120
 So the only bits of the program I saw

448
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,960
 were a very brief amount of the book launch with free wine,

449
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,800
 but I didn't really see any of it,

450
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,880
 because I was busy trying to find the hotel's trolley

451
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
 so that I can move my stuff in,

452
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720
 because the hotel only has one trolley,

453
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,120
 and we need to take wine to the book launch.

454
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
 And then immediately after that,

455
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
 I'm told that there was a ZZ9 party.

456
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,080
 But when I asked people who you might have thought

457
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,240
 would know something about the ZZ9 party about it,

458
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,800
 they were like, "Apparently they just kind of assumed

459
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,440
 that if they put ZZ9 party on the...

460
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,800
 on the main... on the program, it would happen."

461
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,240
 But we just dragged the free wine

462
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,160
 that was left over from the book launch, so...

463
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
 So it did, basically.

464
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,960
 Those were the only things I saw apart from the banquet.

465
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,400
 So I'm sorry.

466
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,840
 Lots of people went to the Serious Scientific Talk,

467
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,520
 which was apparently a Serious Scientific Talk,

468
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,360
 rather than a Serious Scientific Talk.

469
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,120
 Who gave the Serious Scientific Talk?

470
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,800
 I can't remember. There's a little bean one on.

471
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,640
 That's why I wanted to have the program in front of me.

472
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,560
 I would have given you things about the program.

473
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,600
 I wonder if it's on the website.

474
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
 They don't put the program on the internet.

475
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,640
 I remember this from last year.

476
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,200
 I had to take pictures of it and put them in along with Claire,

477
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
 so everyone could have it.

478
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,600
 So basically what I'm getting from this is that ZZ9

479
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 assumed if they just sort of put apart in the program,

480
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,240
 it would happen.

481
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,160
 But then actually they turned up...

482
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,640
 ZZ9... it's not ZZ9's fault at all.

483
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
 Oh, no, the comp put the ZZ9 in the program.

484
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,520
 I think the convention assumed that if they put...

485
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,080
 Oh...

486
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,000
 I see.

487
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,280
 Yes, there was a ZZ9 quiz hosted by Satellite,

488
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,720
 and that was supposed to be very good.

489
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
 But Alison was in a bar.

490
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,040
 Now I think Alison went to the quiz.

491
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,560
 No, no, no, no.

492
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,080
 Was there anything else in the program that looked good

493
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,160
 that you didn't go to?

494
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,080
 I didn't tend to open the read,

495
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,440
 look at the program.

496
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,280
 I mean, the thing about Novocod is that it's got like

497
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,040
 some very nice beer bars.

498
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,840
 So, I mean, my program was that I went to Red Willow,

499
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,280
 the Boxter Brewery Tap, and a nice...

500
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
 Oh, that's what I did on Saturday night.

501
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,080
 We spent three hours in a French restaurant

502
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,320
 eating and drinking.

503
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,840
 And then by the time we got back,

504
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,880
 I could hardly move,

505
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,360
 so I just kind of sat in the lobby for a while

506
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,000
 chatting to people on some of the comfy sofas.

507
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,920
 It's quite hard to get me out of a comfy sofa

508
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,040
 or did to the program.

509
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
 Sorry.

510
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,120
 I had a really good time.

511
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,960
 What you're saying is we should put comfy sofas

512
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,160
 in program rooms.

513
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,240
 Ooh, I quite like that idea.

514
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,400
 Ooh, I do.

515
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,960
 Or beanbags, although I can't care for beanbag.

516
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,640
 Couldn't get out out of one of these sofas.

517
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
 There was one where I just went to stand up and went,

518
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,160
 "Oh, oh no, apparently this sofa is not constructed

519
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,040
 as I had expected."

520
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,320
 And I had to elicit somebody's help to get me out of the chair.

521
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,480
 And then, when the next time I needed to get out of the sofa,

522
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,120
 they were like, "No, my back will not put up with that

523
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,160
 another time."

524
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,120
 Leimproven was there with his partner,

525
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,240
 Yana, and their daughter, Ada, who was extremely cute.

526
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
 It was quite nice to meet her in the flesh.

527
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,840
 Anything else on Novicon, guys?

528
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,520
 Any questions about Novicon?

529
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,760
 Oh, did you want to talk about masks at Novicon?

530
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,880
 About what?

531
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,760
 Masking.

532
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,720
 Wasn't any?

533
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
 Um, well, yeah, you had to wear masking in program rooms,

534
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,280
 except obviously when the program item was a banquet or a book launch or a party.

535
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,960
 Which is, as you know, many of them.

536
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,120
 And you had to wear masks while moving around in the hotel,

537
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,880
 but not while seated in bar areas.

538
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,920
 Now, this, as I said earlier, is a hotel with maybe 32 comfortable sofas.

539
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,680
 In various places.

540
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,440
 And, um, so that meant in practice that I spent almost no time wearing a mask.

541
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,440
 I also didn't notice very many people who were ill.

542
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,360
 This is the first time I've been to a convention that I haven't noticed lots of people

543
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,800
 showing signs of having viral infections.

544
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,720
 So that might bode well.

545
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,040
 I'm not saying the word, Teddy.

546
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,640
 I'm not much about COVID.

547
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,760
 So either nobody caught COVID at the convention,

548
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,320
 or nobody's got sick during the convention or immediately afterwards,

549
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
 or, um, I just haven't heard about it yet.

550
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,440
 And I would like to congratulate the convention committee for doing such a good job on squashing

551
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,360
 all of those COVID stories.

552
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,640
 No, but that's, that is good.

553
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,720
 I mean, I do think, so I think this time last year we had an argument about whether

554
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,280
 or not there would be a wave in time from overcon.

555
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,000
 And I can't remember whether it ended up in the podcast or not,

556
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
 but I think it doesn't look like there has been really.

557
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,880
 I haven't heard, I mean, either that means,

558
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
 I mean, like Alice has said, either that means it's not coming up in the news,

559
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,600
 or it means there has a blue one.

560
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,400
 I don't know which is, but yeah, no, I haven't noticed as many ill people

561
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
 around as I did this time last year.

562
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,200
 So anecdotally, I think Liz was right.

563
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,880
 I can't remember what I said, but I'm glad that I was right.

564
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,320
 You basically said it was impossible to extrapolate whether or not there would be

565
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,400
 an autumn wave every year, or whether or not it'd be like less predictable than that.

566
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
 Yeah, I was smart, wasn't I?

567
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,240
 Yeah.

568
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
 I mean, and beautiful modest, all these things.

569
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,560
 Yeah, I mean, the only way I look at all these things now is I look at the UK ONS survey,

570
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,000
 and it looks like there was a little kind of blip up in September that's on the way back down again.

571
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,320
 So...

572
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
 Did you catch Covid?

573
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,440
 I don't know.

574
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,920
 Awesome.

575
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,280
 That's better than knowing that you did.

576
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,160
 I certainly don't, what day is it today, Tuesday?

577
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,480
 Might not know yet, but I'm quite boosted at the moment, so I'm probably good.

578
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
 I had Covid fairly recently.

579
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,280
 Oh, yes, you, yes.

580
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,840
 I mean, I had a cold which might not have been Covid quite recently,

581
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,600
 and then I got boosted, so hopefully I'm in reasonably good Covid-free shape.

582
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
 I wish that I could pay for a booster.

583
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,560
 If I could pay for a booster, I would get boosted before a recubvention.

584
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,840
 Yeah, no, I think I might too.

585
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,520
 Though, Stephen was really sick this time, so it would be kind of like

586
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,280
 taking several days of ill health as a kind of prepayment on impossible more Covid.

587
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,000
 Come and get your pre-con crud.

588
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,120
 Pre-con crud.

589
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,640
 Pre-con crud.

590
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,120
 Do you fancy guaranteeing your pre-con crud with low risk of post-con crud?

591
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,720
 Have we got the jabs for you?

592
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,320
 I'd be great at advertising.

593
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,360
 And your post-con crud might be worse, but might also not be worse, so it's complicated.

594
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,520
 Octa Thorpe, Covid Roundup.

595
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,800
 I've done one of those for a while.

596
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,920
 Oh, one last thing, did I say, Gen Williams?

597
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,640
 Gen Williams is the guest of honour of the next Nova Con,

598
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,320
 and incidentally, she was the person who did the interstitial art for the fanzine The Lid,

599
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,720
 edited by Alice's Stuart and Marguerite Kenner last week.

600
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,160
 So I was like, "Oh, that's a coincidence."

601
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,840
 I don't know whether that was on purpose or not.

602
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,520
 But yes, and she writes, "Fancy and crime fiction, I understand."

603
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,440
 And Claire Breuerley says she's good.

604
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,800
 Yeah, the friend of the podcast, Claire Breuerley says she's wonderful,

605
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:02,800
 and I discovered I actually own the first of one of her trilogies,

606
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,000
 because Claire told me to buy it when it was on Kindle for 99p.

607
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,480
 So hopefully I'll read that quite soon, certainly before Nova Con next year,

608
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,760
 because it gives you something with...

609
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
 Nova Con is a convention where your charts,

610
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,760
 if running into the guest of Oder in the bar, are very nearly 100%,

611
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,320
 so it's very useful to have read one of their books,

612
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,160
 so you have something to talk to them about.

613
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,480
 Though this time, I was expected Gareth Powell to be at the convention on his honeymoon,

614
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
 because it'd be reported that he would be,

615
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,560
 and he ended up there on his own and had quite a long story about that.

616
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,760
 So I did have something to talk to about him about in the bar,

617
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
 but it wasn't necessarily the joyous.

618
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,480
 I understand you're here on your honeymoon, the tired.

619
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,240
 I hope to talk to him about.

620
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,680
 I have read some of Gareth Powell's books,

621
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,480
 and I have read the Akak Macak, which was good, fun nonsense,

622
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,120
 I would say.

623
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,240
 It is not what I'd call high-concept sci-fi,

624
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,880
 but it was like an enjoyable, rollicking read.

625
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,640
 But he also wrote a book called "Revelation",

626
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,360
 which I did I remember quite enjoying.

627
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,640
 And I need to read more of his stuff,

628
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,600
 but this goes for almost every author in British science fiction,

629
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,880
 because I read two of their books very enthusiastically,

630
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,560
 and then I read two of literally everyone else's books very enthusiastically,

631
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,920
 and then it takes me ages to get back to the first person again,

632
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,760
 which is bad, I should do better.

633
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,880
 What was it called?

634
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,760
 "The recollection", and I gave it four stars,

635
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,600
 and I said I loved the antagonist and how ambiguous the morality was.

636
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,360
 I loved some of the ideas.

637
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,000
 I read it in 2018.

638
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 I do like knowing all these things.

639
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,360
 I had dinner with Ian McDonald on Saturday night,

640
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,360
 and was very glad to be able to say everything I've read of yours is fantastic,

641
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,400
 which it is.

642
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,960
 And I don't know if every other book he's ever written is fantastic,

643
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,560
 because I've only read a small proportion of them for the reasons that John mentions.

644
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,960
 Mostly we talked about walking holidays in that way that you do.

645
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,800
 He was one of the people along with my ex who's just had a comedy accident

646
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,160
 who went walking the Camino with Carrie Spearing for the last several months.

647
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,600
 They'd, I mean Carrie, we spent several months over at other people,

648
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,520
 just kind of dropped him for kind of mini walks of only 100 miles or so.

649
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,560
 So is Carrie doing a 100 mile long walk as a guest of honor item at the 2023 Eastcom?

650
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,680
 I will ask her.

651
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,960
 Okay, thank you.

652
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,200
 Yeah, 100 mile walk with the stars.

653
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,520
 Oh, I'm not going to get on a Sunday morning.

654
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,480
 Departing on the Friday morning, getting back on the Monday night.

655
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,040
 Oh, what we should do is set up a pilgrimage to,

656
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,520
 you could have pilgrimages to the NEC, right?

657
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,600
 So we set up a pilgrimage and say, plan your own walking route at all,

658
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
 put your things and walked.

659
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,080
 We will to enhance our sustainability policy for the 2023 Eastcom.

660
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,960
 We will all have people walk to the convention from different locations and blog

661
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,640
 and have a kind of discord thing about all things they're doing on the way to the NEC.

662
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,400
 This is perfectly rational, right?

663
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,160
 They can all time the finish to be there on Thursday when I will be there

664
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,960
 stamping anyone who's walked at least 100 miles.

665
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,280
 I will stamp their walking passport and stand them up into a beer.

666
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,560
 Right, so Caroline, I'm sure you're glad to hear that that is your convention's transport policy.

667
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,920
 And I look forward to your lock next episode.

668
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,000
 Well, they were asking for sustainability policy.

669
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,560
 Hello, Caroline, let's chat on Friday.

670
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,960
 Right, but does it involve everyone walks 100 miles to the whole convention?

671
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,200
 How far is the NEC away from my house by foot?

672
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,720
 Same distance as it is by other routes, really.

673
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,080
 I mean, probably.

674
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,520
 Not, there won't be much in it.

675
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,440
 Walking directions from Newcastle to the Hilton Birmingham Metropolitan.

676
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,760
 It's 320 kilometres.

677
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,960
 Quite a long way.

678
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,800
 Carrie walked about 800 kilometres on the Camino.

679
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,280
 I said, "So you really would walk 500 miles."

680
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,160
 And she was like, "Oh, yes."

681
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:04,000
 Shall I do my pick?

682
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,040
 Because it is genre fiction, the roaring years,

683
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:15,360
 which is a collection of Peter Nichols' writing that Peter himself had always planned to do.

684
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,800
 But never quite got round to.

685
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,160
 And really quite a long time later, Dave Langford has lovingly put together

686
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,920
 with the help of Peter's family and many of Peter's friends,

687
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,680
 and also friend of the podcast, Claire Barally.

688
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,880
 And so quite a lot of it is serious writing about science fiction.

689
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,520
 Peter had the ability to look at his own writing and say,

690
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,320
 "It wasn't very good until about 1970 or '71, and then it stopped being good in about 2000,

691
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,040
 so we're going to pick that central period."

692
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,520
 And I think there's a degree of self-awareness in that, which is very impressive.

693
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,200
 And so many of his longer, more thoughtful pieces about science fiction books

694
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,920
 and also some more light-hearted writing conventions,

695
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,360
 con reports, things about science fiction fandom, all sorts of great stuff.

696
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,080
 And I haven't actually read all of it because I just formulated the idea that I would read it,

697
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,600
 but everything that I have read so far has been very interesting indeed.

698
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,800
 I particularly love the conventional reports of the finisher me a new chiai and so on,

699
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:29,680
 like raking over the coals of conspiracy 87, the sponsorship deal with new era publications,

700
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,040
 something which would have been very useful reading for the discount committee,

701
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,040
 I think, before their convention, because it might have helped them make slightly different

702
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,040
 committee decisions in advance. I read a review of this book by Adam Roberts,

703
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,800
 and he really, really hates all of that stuff, so horses for courses,

704
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,920
 but I like the fact that it's a mixed collection, and we get to see different facets of Peter

705
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,240
 Nichols' writing. It's very good collection, and you should all go and get it, and we'll put a link

706
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,520
 in the show note. It's available on e-pub, it's also available as a paper book, and all the

707
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,440
 profits are going to support the science fiction encyclopedia, which is a good course,

708
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,240
 even if they don't have an entry for OctaThorp, the rotors.

709
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,240
 I mean, I wouldn't expect them to. Have an entry for Octa? Oh, fuckers.

710
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,360
 I see how it is. Liz, do you have a pick?

711
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,160
 It's a very big to come up with a pick. I don't know, I seem to have,

712
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,680
 I seem to have been in the middle of watching and playing things, and therefore want to finish

713
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,000
 watching Andor playing them before I can pick them as my pick, although I suspect.

714
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,240
 Once the thing I am watching finishes, Joel and I will have to fight about who gets it as their pick,

715
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,840
 foreshadowing, spoilers, etc. Anyway, what is it?

716
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,200
 Star Wars Andor.

717
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,480
 Oh, it's good.

718
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,160
 Yes, it's really staggeringly good.

719
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,960
 What do I have to see first?

720
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,040
 Nothing really, if you have a vague background knowledge of Star Wars and that there's an

721
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,080
 empire and it's maybe not great, then you're probably all right, but Rogue One would probably

722
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,560
 help.

723
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,440
 Seem Rogue One.

724
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,760
 Anyway, that is not my pick because it hasn't finished yet, and it might completely

725
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,680
 fuck up the landing. But speaking of things which don't fuck up the landing,

726
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,520
 I read the third Naomi Novik Scolomant's book.

727
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,920
 I think I've picked all three of these as picks now, and I don't know. It's not that I,

728
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,000
 I don't feel like I love them so much that I was instantly wanting to go out and pick all of them

729
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,920
 as my picks. They've just come at convenient times. Anyway, it's the third book, it is the

730
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,560
 last one of the trilogy, and I think if you remember, I wasn't super keen on the first one because I

731
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:25,920
 felt it was a bit too much of a kind of school story where people were falling into particular

732
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,640
 roles that they play in a school story.

733
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,360
 Yeah.

734
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,880
 And the second one is kind of about them maybe subverting that a bit in that without doing

735
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,680
 going too deep into spoilers, instead of it being school rivalries, it becomes kind of like how

736
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:46,320
 the students themselves can basically unite against this school system, which is screwing them all over.

737
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,160
 And in the third book, they are out of the school and back into kind of the real world,

738
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:59,120
 or this is a magical world, and it's kind of about how they take the kind of teamwork and

739
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,800
 cooperation and work together that they had in the school and try and kind of put that into practice

740
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,240
 in this incredibly unfair magical world that is outside the school.

741
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,680
 It's kind of interesting. It's very dark in places when you work at what people have been doing to

742
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,600
 maintain this system. It is essentially about a kind of corrupt system that is only maintained by

743
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,120
 the suffering of the few for the benefit of the many, although it's not even that many in some

744
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,560
 cases and about what choices they make when presented with this.

745
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,840
 I think if you really are into the kind of romance of books one and two, you probably

746
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,520
 will be a little bit disappointed because I don't think that's not as big a part of this book as

747
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,200
 you might expect, but I was never super into that anyway, and it really just has those two characters

748
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,400
 there to kind of be opposites to each other as they have been all series. And you find out a lot

749
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,400
 more about why they are the opposites. They are. It's not an entirely random coincidence.

750
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,760
 I'm trying to do this without doing too many spoilers, but it's quite hard when it's the third

751
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,080
 one in a trilogy. Anyway, I liked it. I will almost certainly put this as one of my picks for Hugo

752
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,800
 Best Series and possibly for Load Star Award as well.

753
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
 I'm quite excited to hear that the third one's out.

754
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,440
 Yeah, it was out like a month ago and it just popped up as though, oh you might like to buy this on

755
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,640
 my Kindle list, bought it and read it in a day. It's one of those books.

756
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,520
 What you said about them leaving and going out into an unfair magical world reminds me a little

757
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,920
 bit of Lev Grosman's The Magicians, but it sounds like this sticks the landing better than that book

758
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,800
 did. Maybe? Didn't love the second half of The Magicians, if I'm honest.

759
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,200
 I mean, what the whole trilogy?

760
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,080
 Oh no, I don't like the second half of the first book.

761
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,640
 Oh I see. Very much. I thought it was a bit flimsy, I guess. I quite like where he goes with it in

762
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,280
 books two and three, but yeah. Yeah, interesting. There's some things I prefer about The Magicians.

763
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,680
 I think The Magicians kind of get that young adults figuring out what adults they're going to be.

764
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,200
 Yeah. Better. Oh yeah, 100%. They're like 100%. I agree with that.

765
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,520
 I know I think Scallamance is kind of a more traditional, not being more traditional, but

766
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,360
 where it goes at the end of the trilogy is possibly a more obvious place to take it than where The

767
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,280
 Magicians kind of venture at the end of the trilogy. Okay, yeah, I can see that.

768
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,760
 Yeah, it's kind of a, just more of a first book they're in school, second book they're figuring

769
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,120
 out how to survive the school system and third book they're on the outside.

770
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,840
 So I decided not to read the second one until the third one was out because I thought I would

771
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,400
 find that Lefanga rather irritating. I'm so quite excited that the third one is out and I will

772
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,520
 probably read them now because I did really enjoy the first one even though there was

773
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,320
 something about it that really annoyed me. Ha! Okay, I am very bad at telling whether you enjoy

774
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,600
 things because the way you talk about them does not portray your level of enjoyment in a way that I

775
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:06,880
 can, I would have guessed it was a two out of five for you. I think I said, you know, I think I've

776
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,080
 finished my review by saying, "recommended for people who like this sort of thing and really

777
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:16,480
 who doesn't?" So, you know, very entertaining books. Yes, I am going to pick another extremely

778
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:25,440
 timely thing. I am going to pick Star Wars the next generation there. I am going to pick Star

779
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,560
 Trek the next generation, which quite good. It has rough spots. One notable rough spot is

780
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,480
 the entirety of series one to four. That's quite rough. But once you get to the good bits,

781
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,120
 it's quite good. It's got some great science fiction in it. It's got Darnock, which is

782
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,080
 possibly one of the best episodes of science fiction television ever made. And also Chain of

783
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,800
 Command, which is an amazing episode. And especially in season seven has some really

784
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,000
 quite good bits, although it does still have episodes where it's like, "Waf is concerned about

785
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,200
 Klingonism and Riker is a bit horny." And you're like, "Yes, but we've seen this episode quite a

786
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,520
 few times now, so it'd be good if we could have a different one." The end, the last episode,

787
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:15,200
 is stupid. Like, it completely fluffs the ending in the tradition of all long-running,

788
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,000
 well-known genre TV shows. But because it's not really building up to that end, because it is not

789
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,560
 particularly an arc-driven show, it does matter. And the penultimate episode is very good.

790
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,480
 I'm glad I have watched it. I have now watched All of Star Trek, the original series, which also

791
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,320
 has a terrible last episode. And all of NextGen and I've moved on to Voyager. And I'm quite

792
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:45,680
 enjoying Voyager so far. It's quite good. Certainly better than early Next Generation and early Star

793
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,880
 Trek and early Discovery, which are the other three Star Trek shows I've watched. I went lower

794
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,120
 decks, but that starts brilliant and stays brilliant, so unfair comparison.

795
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,240
 Have you guys seen Star Trek the Next Generation? Remind me who the captain is? French.

796
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:08,480
 Sounds extremely French. Jean-Luc Picard. Yeah, I've seen some of it then. A very long time ago.

797
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,080
 Played by noted French actor Patrick Stewart doing an amazing French accent.

798
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,760
 Yeah, then I've definitely seen some of it.

799
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,280
 By it is my quest to have watched All of Star Trek eventually. And it's slowly getting there.

800
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,080
 It's all still on all, no, sorry, no, all of it. At least NextGen, DS9 and Voyager are all still

801
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,120
 on Netflix. So I am taking advantage of my brother's Netflix before they clamp down on the account

802
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,520
 sharing next year. Yeah. Oh, right. Are they going to do that? Yep, they've announced it.

803
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:44,720
 So how much of All of Star Trek have you watched now, John? Uh, I've watched all of TOS,

804
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:53,040
 all of TNG, like the first five episodes of Voi, um, all of Lower Decks, first three seasons of

805
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,880
 Discovery. I haven't watched Strange New Worlds, haven't watched Enterprise. I think I've seen all

806
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,640
 the movie. Picard, the animated series? I haven't seen the animated series. It's on my list,

807
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,920
 but I suspect it'll be on Paramount Plus rather than on Netflix. That was The Old

808
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,640
 Law podcast and it's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me.

809
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,480
 John, why is it? Why is it very purple in your room? I got new bulbs. I actually know I got new lamps.

810
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,240
 I already had the bulbs. Oh, do you have a sign on saying on air? I would love to. I'm going out

811
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,040
 to that be yet. So the Taspania knows not to break in except with pancakes. The cats, however,

812
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,280
 well, the cats haven't managed door handles yet, right? No, they have not because we don't have,

813
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,120
 we don't have like door handles. They have door knobs. They are tricky because they don't have

814
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,920
 thumbs. I believe once they have thumbs, you have to report them to a kind of special

815
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,640
 special secret service that deals with the cats with thumbs. Well, that's the episode art.

816
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:18,880
 I don't know how you can do that as a all being secret cat detectives, but that is absolutely it

817
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,000
 and I look forward to Octa Thorper's secret cat detectives. I was just gonna say we want a

818
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,200
 picture of like a cat hand creeping up towards a door knob with a thumb, preferably one of John's

819
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,920
 cats and John's door knob. Maybe it should have been old bebades in special octa Thorperple light.

820
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,760
 It is quite good in here when it's purple. It's quite purple. It is.

821
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,440
 You did it like a professional YouTuber, whereas I look like I'm in a basement somewhere.
