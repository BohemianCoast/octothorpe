00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Oh wait, you've got Morris throat, I see. Um, podcasting? Shall we... Shall we do some?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:27,760
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 49th episode of Octothorpe, the podcast for science

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,080
 fiction and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 20th of January 2022.

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,680
 Happy birthday Bella. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty.

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,640
 And we have an announcement for the start of the episode, which is every time that we say 2020

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,680
 instead of saying 2021 and every time we say 2021 instead of saying 2022, you should take a drink.

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,400
 So please go and get your drink. We will wait. You back? Good. Get ready. And we have some letters

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,280
 of comment. Are you drinking comfortably? Then we'll begin. I mean, in fact, I think we have

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,680
 something better than a letter of comment, don't we? We do have something better than a letter of

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:17,360
 comment. I'll put a photo in the chapter art. We got liquid of comment from our podcasting friends

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,120
 at This Never Happens. Um, the Cornish end of that. They sent us a beer from Polly's Brewery,

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:31,600
 which is somewhere in North Wales, called This Never Happened, which is a 13.1% quadruple IPA.

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,040
 I feel like there's only one can, but that's plenty for three of us. And hopefully we're

14
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,440
 going to drink it at Easter, if Liz gets over for Eastercon. And if Liz doesn't get over for

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,520
 Eastercon, John and I will drink it and then phone Liz drunkenly. And tell her how nice it was.

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,560
 At length. Drunkenly. I did email Blue Bee Brewery because I found on Untappd that they do a beer

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,840
 called Octothorpe. But apparently it was a one-off beer and it was brewed over five years ago.

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,720
 So thanks to Josh at Blue Bee Brewery for telling me that. I'm very sad. If there are any

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,560
 brewers listening, please brew a beer called Octothorpe. It would be great. And let us know. I

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,080
 think we're looking at you, Dave Mansfield. Or Dave Coxon. Don't just let us know,

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,160
 send us some. Oh, Dave Coxon brews beer. So, so yeah, how many Octothorpe listeners brew beer?

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,760
 That would be good. And why have none of you sent us any? Please brew beer called Octothorpe

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,000
 and send us some. That would be nice. So it turns out that the demands we make on the podcast

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,280
 scale in magnitude linearly to the length of time we podcast. So, you know, by episode 200,

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,440
 we'll be asking for the Moon, but it started here with this request for beer.

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,400
 A pony made of diamonds. We did actually get a letter of comment from Dave Coxon, who I just

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,520
 mentioned that our comment about Xinjiang got him to thinking, is there a reason we don't have

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,840
 guest panellists on the podcast? And I think he was coming at it from the perspective that we said

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
 we didn't know much about that. And he said, well, you could always, you know, get someone who does.

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,600
 So this is something that we're going to talk about in an upcoming post on Cora Buhlert's blog.

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,440
 She has, she has asked us some questions about the Octothorpe philosophy,

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,160
 which she asked to a lot of people doing fannish content. And so we will pop a link in the show

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,760
 notes as and when those come out. Um, but basically we, yeah, we try not to have guests because

34
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,920
 it's not really what we're trying to do. I'm strongly, strongly considering it though, because if we

35
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:37,120
 had a guest on, we'd have to start on time. Welp, that's us told.

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:48,400
 Savage. Right. Jonathan Baddeley writes in to say that Tedious NPC would make a great badge ribbon.

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,360
 This is, I think, inspired by the discussion we had last time where I said I was going to have

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,240
 my tedious MPC hat on, which is the Mark Protection Committee, an NPC is a non-player character,

39
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,640
 but tedious NPC is a great badge ribbon. So thank you, Jonathan, for writing in. We also had

40
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,880
 a comment from Ali Baker, who basically talked to us about the two panels that she was on at

41
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,960
 DisCon III and said it was really good that they got a lot of audience questions on both panels,

42
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,400
 because a big downside of being on a panel online is the lack of the feedback you would get from

43
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,440
 a live audience. And she says the campaign for normalizing emojis in Zoom chat starts here.

44
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,000
 You can kind of do reacts in Zoom. You can make clapping happen on your little

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,200
 video box, and when you're doing a panel, they can float up from the bottom, and it's all very

46
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,880
 good. But I do think more people need to know about this and use them. So yes, use emojis in your

47
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,960
 Zoom chat. Ali was moderating that panel, but I was kind of the Zoom room host for it, and I thought

48
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,680
 it was a smashing panel, really enjoyed it. It was very late at night for the UK, like 11 o'clock

49
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,320
 or midnight or something. So that would be a great one to listen to again when the

50
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,080
 DisCon panels come out, which they will do super soon. Kat Tanaka Okopnik, says that Nice is

51
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,960
 not bidding for 2026, which gives us a little bit more time to squeeze in that viewing of

52
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,960
 Brice de Nice. So, you know, sad news that it's not going to be 2026, but I will still be cosplaying,

53
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,160
 people. Several of our listeners wrote to talk about movies that they recommend if you want to have

54
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:40,560
 a big cry, and Fran Dowd talks about going to see Platoon with a bunch of veterans, and she says that

55
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
 she wasn't so much crying herself, but she was out in the lobby after 10 minutes running an

56
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,800
 impromptu therapy session with them. She had to go back again to watch the movie later. And

57
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,520
 Ang Rosin said she went to see Dead Poets Society on a date and was sobbing so much she couldn't

58
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,440
 walk. And Farah talks about Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe. I have never seen that,

59
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,800
 but I'm told it's a bit of a weepy. Thank you everyone for writing in, those were brilliant.

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,040
 After the last time's episode, I've been listening to podcasts and I'm going to talk about that

61
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,840
 a bit more later in the episode, but I particularly appreciated the sponsor read on Podside Picnic,

62
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,320
 and we're putting a link into the show notes. This is a Raytheon joke. And we had a bit of a chat

63
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,440
 last time about whether we could do a sponsor read for Octothorpe very much along these lines.

64
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,480
 I think they've done a better job of it. So, you know, props to you, Podside Picnic.

65
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,600
 Chris Garcia wrote in and said he was going to bid a relaxafic, and he still might for 2024,

66
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:47,200
 and it might be at an actual hotel, and it will be programming light. I would come Chris, and also,

67
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,840
 Chris says on the time shifting of cons, a 24-hour Zoom hangout area would be great,

68
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,000
 and it would make cons a little nicer. Yeah, so that leads back to the thing that I've been

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,320
 bleating on about for nearly two years at this point, which is that conventions need to

70
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,200
 let people know well in advance that the Zoom consuites exist and put things in them, because

71
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,680
 it's not like people can go, oh, I can just wander up to the consuite and see if people are there and

72
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,680
 grab some snacks and food and stuff and drinks, they need to have some reason to go in.

73
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,320
 But yeah, there was a hang out. My response to Chris is: Chris, that is not a valid anagram.

74
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,120
 Okay. What was the anagram? He's tried to anagram,

75
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,040
 "Crimbo no" from Omicron, and it's like, no, there's no B in it, Chris. Which is actually

76
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,640
 pronounced ombnicron. No.

77
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,280
 So back in October, I don't think we mentioned it on the podcast, but Jason Sanford put on his

78
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,200
 Patreon a post about basically the difficulties, the financial difficulties specifically for

79
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:57,200
 international authors, and this came up again this week because of the news that

80
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,960
 Best African Speculative Fiction, Year's Best African SF, which is being edited by

81
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,440
 Ogenechovwe Donald Ekpeki, basically had their Kindle Direct Publishing account kind of deleted

82
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,240
 without recourse for breaking some rule that they didn't know they'd broken or may indeed not

83
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
 have broken. Basically one of these sort of automated algorithmic shutdowns of your account,

84
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,880
 at the point where they told a bunch of copies and were relying on the money in the account to,

85
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,880
 you know, pay royalties to the authors in it. We'll link to the thread, but basically it's

86
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,480
 just another example of the difficulties of being an author. It's specifically in some countries,

87
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,920
 and in this case, it seems likely that by being in Nigeria, this has triggered some algorithmic

88
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,440
 scrutiny because of Nigeria, you know, looking more suspect than other countries in some ways,

89
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,280
 but it also kind of goes hand in hand with the issues of, you know, if you can't access PayPal,

90
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,720
 then you can't use venues like Smashwords and, you know, essentially just the extra difficulties

91
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,720
 and hoops you have to jump through to be able to publish from outside the US or maybe even the UK

92
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,880
 are just much bigger than I think a lot of us really think about.

93
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,520
 There are a whole pile of things that might be a bit dull here, but there's a lot of stuff about

94
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,360
 tax treaties and the fact that countries like the UK have very comfortable tax treaties with the

95
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,840
 US that mean that although you have a bit of paperwork to do, you won't actually have

96
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,760
 tax removed twice from your earnings. That doesn't mean to say that people in the US or the UK are

97
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,400
 immune to Amazon shutting down accounts randomly, but it does appear that this batch has mostly been

98
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,080
 in countries that are not traditional homes of the English-language science fiction publishing

99
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,920
 market. Quite a lot of people have been caught by this, but I think Ekpeki's the biggest example

100
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,840
 there. Then Amazon did come back and say, "We will reinstate your account as a one-time deal",

101
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,480
 but he was quite reasonably not persuaded by the language and tone that they used,

102
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
 because they were just like, "We might take it away again at any time", and this doesn't mean

103
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
 that you think you're doing the right thing or anything like that. It just means that a lot of

104
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,400
 friends have made a lot of noise on your behalf. It's not great. No, and it clearly requires you,

105
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,840
 you know, you clearly have an advantage there if you have friends who can make noise on your

106
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,480
 behalf. So this is probably happening to a lot of people who do not have even recourse to

107
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,560
 discuss this on Twitter and maybe get some solution to it. I think what Sanford also goes into in

108
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,280
 his post is that there are sometimes alternatives to this if you can't be paid through PayPal or

109
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,720
 Venmo, but a lot of the time they charge huge transaction fees. So you're losing a massive chunk

110
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,280
 of your earnings just by trying to get them remitted to you in a currency you can use.

111
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,960
 It's not uncommon for the major platforms to treat the use of those sorts of services as a red flag

112
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,760
 for their algorithms as well, so it doesn't necessarily help. These books include one of the

113
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
 books that we previously had as a pick on Octothorpe. And I think it's really important

114
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,200
 that it's possible for people to get hold of these books. Yeah.

115
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:05,040
 Shall we go on to talking about hot goss? So we had a few bits of follow-up about Worldcon. We're

116
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,160
 not quite done with Worldcon yet for one reason or another. So File 770 had a long thread about

117
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,840
 Winnipeg's possible NASFiC bid. I think we have two definite NASFiC bids which are

118
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,400
 Winnipeg and Orlando and that thread has a lot of people saying, but here's actually what went on

119
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,000
 in site selection at DisCon. So two things on that. First, if you're interested – which I

120
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,080
 probably think you aren't at this point, because we're all just moving on, aren't we? – then it's there and also,

121
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,320
 one of the things about all the people going here is what really went on is that these accounts

122
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,840
 do not correlate. It's like Rashomon for site selection. I'm also really, I'm sure there was

123
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,360
 something I meant to mention from like Cheryl's Worldcon report and I will fish it out in a minute.

124
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,480
 Oh yes, Cheryl Morgan's also done an enormously long Worldcon report, which is all about this.

125
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,000
 Yeah, I think I found that thread very interesting, in particular because after the site selection

126
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,680
 business meeting fiasco, there then seemed to be quite a lot of comments in Facebook, File 770,

127
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,760
 Twitter, various places saying, you know, oh, you didn't know like the whole story.

128
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,520
 And what is evident is that we probably didn't know the whole story, possibly no one agrees on

129
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,080
 the whole story, but it all seems to require that you just have faith and trust that someone

130
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,680
 behind the scenes knows what's going on and we should just kind of almost leave them to it.

131
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,560
 It's very weird. Yeah, a lot of people are like, you didn't know the whole story and everyone thinks

132
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,880
 that it was this and it's like, well, the reason people thought it was that is because it looked

133
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,560
 like that. And if you didn't want it to look like that, there is an element here of making sure you

134
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,200
 were communicating with people outside the convention who were watching to make it clear what was

135
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,840
 happening, but waiting three weeks and then saying, oh, it was actually this. That's not helpful.

136
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,760
 Say it's actually this at the point it's happening. There is a version of events here in

137
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,880
 which it was all very, you know, all very above board and all very done with good intentions.

138
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,400
 And it, you know, you might believe that that is true. But certainly, it's a lot harder to believe

139
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,920
 that that's true given that it's all being put together from post-hoc rationalisations and

140
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
 "oh, actually, people have got the wrong end of the stick" instead of people standing up and being

141
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
 like, "actually, we want to have a measured conversation about this and we're not trying to fix the

142
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,480
 vote". But certainly from the outside, it looked an awful lot like you were trying to fix the vote.

143
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,080
 And if you didn't want it to, you should have done it differently. It's not our fault that it looked

144
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,080
 like that. It's yours. I think is my basic perspective. But here's one of my two takeaways on virtual

145
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,960
 and hybrid conventions for convention committees, which is especially on hybrid conventions.

146
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,960
 If you're running a hybrid convention, you need to think very hard all the time about how you're

147
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,400
 going to involve the people at the physical convention with the people at the online convention so

148
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,280
 that you don't end up with two totally separate conventions. Because if there had been a lot more

149
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,440
 people chatting who were physically at the convention with people who were not physically at the

150
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,400
 convention, this wouldn't have happened. And if you had designed ways of making that happen as

151
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,520
 part of your convention, you would have fostered that single-convention feeling. That's why it's so

152
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,960
 important and that's why people should do it. Yes. It's very hard though. Yeah. It is. Oh yeah, it's

153
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,240
 very difficult. I don't, I accept it might be hard, but at the moment nobody's properly tried

154
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,920
 it. So, you know. No, yeah, fair enough. Spinning out from the subject of site selection, Steve Cooper

155
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:28,320
 has set up a mailing list to look at trying to address the problem of electronic site selection.

156
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,960
 And we will have a link in the show notes if you'd like to go and get involved with that.

157
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,520
 I was quite in favour of using groups.io and the reason that I was is that although you think

158
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,440
 "mailing list", all the stuff is archived online. So it's a very good way of actually having a

159
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,640
 discussion that people can then follow back and trace through in a way that a traditional mailing

160
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:58,160
 list often isn't. But it is still a mailing list. That group is full of SMOFs. I mean, I guess

161
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:05,440
 that Steve Cooper has a lot of SMOFfy friends. But. Who knew? Who knew that a group devoted to

162
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,520
 like discussing the finer points of the WSFS Constitution was going to attract SMOFs?

163
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:20,400
 And Chicon 8 have said about Hugo nominations that they will open later in January and will run

164
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:28,000
 through to mid-March 2022. All members of DisCon III and anyone who joined Chicon 8 before the 31st

165
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,440
 of January 2022 will be eligible to nominate in this year's Hugo Awards. And obviously,

166
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,160
 all members of Chicon 8 will be eligible to vote. So if you want to nominate and you're not a member

167
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:45,440
 of DisCon, join Chicon 8 before the end of this month. You've got about a week and a half at the

168
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,200
 point that this episode drops. That's a slightly later deadline than usual. This is why it's relevant.

169
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,920
 Normally, the cut-off for nomination rights is before nominations open. There's likely to

170
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,920
 be a slight overlap. I don't think it matters. They've pushed it back because DisCon was so much later

171
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,240
 than... They've pushed it back, they've pushed the deadline back because we made a constitutional

172
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,920
 change to push the deadline back, right? As in the date when you have to join Chicon,

173
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,040
 sorry, have I got the wrong end of the stick? Did we make a constitutional change? Am

174
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,920
 I just talking through my hat? I think we made a constitutional change. But to check this,

175
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,240
 I will have to go and look at the WSFS... It wouldn't be the first time I talk bollocks on the podcast.

176
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,400
 Just so that's why I'm just going to do a little check. I think I was not really paying attention

177
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,080
 at that point at the business meeting or really not full attention, but I thought there was a

178
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,880
 constitutional amendment to amend this. Yeah, no, no, it's here. Section 3.7.1, they've crossed out

179
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,280
 member as of the end of the previous calendar year and it's now as of January 31st of the

180
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:53,200
 current calendar year. Sorry, that was garbled. But I think I was correct and I value factual

181
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,880
 accuracy above getting to my dinner 30 seconds faster. So.

182
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,760
 Which section did you say it was Liz? 3.7.1.

183
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,160
 3.7.1. Anyway, it's also kind of irrelevant. The point is that you can still join and nominate

184
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,440
 in the Hugos. Okay, so I sincerely apologise for talking bollocks on the podcast and I will

185
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:21,360
 endeavor never to do it again. Oh god, clip that out, John. Paying members can get that sound clip

186
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:29,360
 in the secret archive. The WSFS Constitution and deadlines for Hugo nominations bring us neatly

187
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:38,240
 onto the topic of the Hugo Awards and friend of the show, Nicholas Whyte, wrote quite a long

188
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:46,800
 response in answer to the questions we asked him last episode. So... It's quite a long article.

189
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,280
 It's quite interesting and we're going to point you at it. Thank you very much, Nicholas. We very

190
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,600
 much appreciate it. Yes, thank you for writing such a long and detailed response to our

191
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,080
 casual invocation of your name on the podcast. The question that Nicholas Whyte answered for us is

192
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,960
 he answers a question about E Pluribus Hugo for us and whether or not it's vulnerable particularly

193
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,160
 to bullet nominations, which we discussed last time. And he also discusses the logic between what

194
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,320
 puts a finalist on the Long Form or Short Form Dramatic Presentation ballots. So if you're interested

195
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,600
 in either of those two things, we highly recommend going to read his write-up. Very deep in that is

196
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,880
 Nicholas's confession that he's the person who wrote the explanation of EPH on the Finnish website

197
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,520
 that we linked to last time. So thanks for doing that, Nicholas, because that was a thing that allowed

198
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:50,720
 me to understand EPH. So this year's fanzine winner, Nerds of a Feather, has recused itself from the 2022

199
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,880
 Hugos. File 770 writes quite an interesting piece about the history of doing this. File 770,

200
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,440
 of course, has permanently removed itself from consideration for Hugos. And I like the tradition.

201
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,720
 It's been going on for a little while, but what Nerds of a Feather have done and what a few other recent

202
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,040
 winners have done is recused themselves for just one year. So they don't say, "Never give us a Hugo

203
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,640
 again, chaps." They go, "Well, we've got a Hugo now. Next year, why don't you look at all the other

204
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,600
 great stuff that's going on in this space?" And what that does is break the tendency for people

205
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:36,720
 to nominate and vote for whatever won last year. And I think had this been a tradition back in 2005

206
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,480
 and 2006, when Plokta won its Hugos, we might have recused ourselves for one year, because we did

207
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,760
 win the Hugo the following year, much to our surprise. And I think it was just the kind of positive

208
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,560
 feedback we got that after we won the Hugo the first time people went to go and look at

209
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,040
 the fanzine. And I think taking yourself out for a year and saying, "Now look at all the other

210
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,400
 stuff", especially in fannish categories, where the fact that there's a lot of stuff in the

211
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,160
 category is very much the point. We have a lot of good things and we want people to know what they

212
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,000
 are. So that was my thought on that. I like it. I'm glad they've done it. I'm glad that other

213
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,560
 fan winners do that and I encourage it. I basically have not such strong feelings on this one. I can

214
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,040
 see both sides of the coin. One is that it's nice to recuse yourself because of that possible

215
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,560
 bounce just from being on the ballot year after year in some cases. But also, if you recuse yourself,

216
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,320
 then if people really do think you were the best fanzine, whatever, in that year and they can't

217
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,000
 vote for you, it means they have to vote something they think is not actually the best thing.

218
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,880
 So I can sort of see both sides. So I think maybe yeah, recusing yourself for a year, but not forever

219
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:50,480
 is a nice way to do it. My perspective on this is that I very much like it when works recuse

220
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:58,080
 themselves and I have been advocating... I think I prefer the model where if you win a certain number

221
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,640
 of times, you permanently recuse yourself. So something I think I've said on the podcast before,

222
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,720
 but I do wish for instance that Uncanny would recuse themselves because although I think they're

223
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,280
 still doing fantastic work, I do think it would be better for the genre if other semiprozines got

224
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,280
 recognition. I was very glad that FIYAH Magazine won this year for that reason. And you look back

225
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,400
 in the history of the genre and there are certain other works that won repeatedly and possibly could

226
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,440
 have taken three rockets. We're looking at you, Langford. I was actually thinking thinking of Locus, but yes.

227
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,400
 But no, I think having a tradition where you feel able to recuse yourself is very good. I think

228
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,840
 this is one of the big problems with certain other awards is that when you suggest that

229
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,600
 people could recuse themselves if they don't want to win infinite awards, they look at you funny and

230
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,760
 say, "Ah, but that wouldn't be done." Which I kind of hugely disagree with and I think...

231
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,560
 But there is a point that is made and which Liz just made, which is, you know, do you want the

232
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,560
 award to be the best fanzine except for all the things that have recused themselves or do you

233
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,920
 want it to be the objectively best fanzine? And my response to that criticism would be,

234
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,840
 if you want it to be objectively the best fanzine, well, firstly, that's impossible,

235
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,640
 but secondly, you're a lot more likely to get that if you have a juried award than a popular one,

236
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,840
 I would argue. And so I think the Hugo have never really been about awarding the objectively

237
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,680
 best thing. And so it always kind of seemed like an odd argument to me.

238
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:29,200
 But also, I think this was a much better argument in a year when an enthusiastic fanzine reader could

239
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,400
 thoroughly survey the field and have a pretty good idea of what was out there and what

240
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,000
 and what things people thought were good. But now we've got multiple different communities doing

241
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,760
 multiple different sorts of things. And I think the more we can do to bring more different good

242
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,800
 things to everybody's attention, the better. On that topic, we're going to be trying to

243
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,800
 promote things that we think are good in the SFnal community through the next year.

244
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,480
 I'm really liking Hugo, Girl!, which is a terrible pun, but also quite a good podcast. And they

245
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,200
 were directly below us in the... It's a great pun. It's a great pun. They were directly below us in the

246
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:17,680
 longlist. And this is a podcast where three feminists talk about Hugo-winning things and

247
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,880
 Hugo-nominated things from a feminist perspective. And the one that I've listened to and really

248
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,800
 enjoyed this week is their one on the first of the Expanse novels, which of course I haven't read,

249
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,040
 but because I've seen the whole of the first series now, I felt well, it can't spoil me too

250
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,040
 much. And indeed, it did not. It was fine because they're coming at it from a feminist point of view

251
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,960
 they point out all of the things that you might expect them to point out in a novel from a little

252
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,800
 while ago that was written by a couple of bros and was intending to be men's adventure fic.

253
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,480
 And I'm sorry for stealing all your jokes, guys, but they make a joke about how this is categorized

254
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,240
 by Amazon as men's adventure fiction. And so they went, well, what on earth would women's adventure

255
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,600
 fiction be? And they looked it up and they discovered that it was all the same books in the top 10

256
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,200
 places. It turns out that if you like adventure fiction, then your gender is not particularly

257
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,920
 germane to the sort of thing you like. Yeah, so it's very funny, really enjoyed it.

258
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,600
 And I would recommend that you check it out if you like that sort of thing. There is a problem

259
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,600
 with, for me, with podcasts that talk about works that I don't much like to be spoiled for them.

260
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,520
 So I only like the ones that I've already read. And as we know, Bob, I don't read enough science

261
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,880
 fiction. Yeah, I mean, Alison has not entirely stolen my thunder, but I have also been listening

262
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,480
 to some episodes of Hugo, Girl!, which I cannot say it in the right way to like do the sassy joke.

263
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:52,080
 Hugo, Girl!? Yeah, no. And yeah, I like it. Liz is not sufficiently sassy. And that is the

264
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,640
 title of the episode. Boom! Not sufficiently sassy. You haven't seen her when she's hungry,

265
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,200
 have you? That is hangry and not sassy, Alison. Yeah, I haven't actually caught the one about

266
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,400
 Leviathan Wakes. But yes, I can see that they probably have many of the same criticisms

267
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,160
 I have of Leviathan Wakes, which the Expanse TV adaptation in some ways mitigates by pulling in

268
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,600
 some stuff from like later books in order that there are more ladies in the cast. Yeah, I listened

269
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,000
 to their episode recently on Dragonflight by Anne McCaffrey, which is, you know, one of those books

270
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,600
 where, when I read it when I was like 13, it was great. And if you read it when you are not 13,

271
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,360
 it is maybe less great. But they do a really interesting job, I think, of trying to say,

272
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,160
 look, this is not like typical of the time, but let's look at the context of when it won,

273
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,880
 and let us look at the context of, you know, some of society at the time. And I think, you know,

274
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,760
 they're not excusing it, but they are saying, let us put it into context, and maybe these

275
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,160
 are things that were considerations that I hadn't thought about. So I thought that was a very interesting

276
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,880
 listen. I would like to ask you, John, is their logo a misappropriation of the Hugo trademark or

277
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,960
 whatever it is? Hugo service mark? No, I don't think so. No, it's a parody work,

278
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,200
 and it's clearly fine in context. Yeah, I know I'm making, I'm making another Mark Protection joke,

279
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,680
 because I like them. This is not as funny as you hoped it would be. No, it's not. Because I am

280
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:28,880
 very tedious. With my tedious MPC hat on. Yeah, I was hoping we get some comedy gold out of that,

281
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:37,680
 and... and we did not. Tedious MPC corner. I think we need to move on.

282
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,880
 I mean, I do. I like also that it is. It's not just kind of, you know, going back through the

283
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,280
 Best Novel over time. It is, you know, jumping about in time and picking up, looking up really,

284
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,280
 you know, lesser known works I haven't read like some of the Retro Hugo nominees, things like that.

285
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,080
 I find more interesting than just if we were going to do like, you know, the past 20 years of Best

286
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,000
 Novel. But anyway, they're great. Would get a vote from me, a nomination from me. If I, I don't

287
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,920
 know, I might find more than six things by the time we get round to nominating. Who knows? Well you're

288
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:19,440
 only allowed to nominate five, so. Fan Achievement Awards have opened for voting. These are the achievement awards

289
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:29,600
 given by fanzine fans to fanzine fans. And there is a list, An Incompleat Register 2021, which has

290
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,000
 been published by Nic Farey, who is the administrator of the FAAN awards. And that tells you what the

291
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,920
 categories you can vote in are and gives you some examples of fanzines that you could vote for.

292
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,760
 And normally I would say by fanzine fans, they mean traditional fanzine fans, but clearly in this

293
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:56,000
 case, they know what they mean because they've said what a fanzine is. And so therefore you can

294
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,040
 deduce what a fanzine fan is. Yes, a fanzine for our purposes is defined as an immutable artefact

295
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,560
 once published, not subject to revision or modification. The fanzine might not exist in a

296
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:16,560
 physical form. A PDF, for example, is an artefact. And what that means, I think, is that Octothorpe

297
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:24,000
 is a fanzine. Yes. We're an artefact, right. We are an artefact. Certainly... We do not exist in a physical

298
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,040
 form. I mean, we exist in a physical form, but the podcast doesn't. So if a PDF is an artefact, then...

299
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:37,600
 I'm actually made of pure energy, especially if I've had enough coffee. That explains so much.

300
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,840
 I mean, if a PDF is an artefact, then an MP3 is presumably also an artefact.

301
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,440
 Yeah, clearly, if a PDF is an artefact, then the MP3 is an artefact and we are a fanzine for the

302
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,120
 purposes of the FAAN awards. And what's really interesting is the sort of fanzine we are because

303
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,960
 they also go on to define genzine and perzine. And for the benefit of listeners who might not be

304
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,920
 voting in the FAAN awards... Please don't vote in the FAAN awards unless you are part of the community

305
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,680
 that votes in the FAAN awards. A genzine is traditionally a kind of bigger zine maybe with a few editors.

306
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,840
 I mean, something like Journey Planet is clearly a genzine. Lots of different editors, lots of

307
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,840
 different stuff. It's a genzine. A perzine is traditionally something where somebody talks about

308
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,680
 their harrowing divorce in some detail. That's your perzine, right? And obviously, there's a gap

309
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,440
 between those. So they've also decided to define the difference between perzine and genzine.

310
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:42,000
 And they've described perzine as a fanzine, which typically has few, if any, contributors

311
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,680
 other than its editors. So, was it Dave Coxon who asked why we didn't have interviews?

312
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,720
 Because the answer is, if we had interviews, we would be a genzine. But as we don't,

313
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,320
 we're a perzine because there's three of us and we do it all ourselves.

314
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,200
 Actually, John does it all. So when you're voting for the FAAN awards, remember that we...

315
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,760
Octothorpe is a perzine. So, just to clarify for those who are confused as to where these

316
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:18,960
 words come from, a genzine is a general interest fanzine and a perzine is a personalised fanzine,

317
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,240
 according to Fancyclopedia. And that kind of is why you have these two different feels of zine

318
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,640
 and where the words originally came from. But those are not the same definitions as the one that

319
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,920
 Nic has used in The Incompleat Register for the FAAN awards, so but anyway.

320
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,160
 So Bill Burns said in the comments of the File 770 discussion of this, that by these definitions,

321
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:47,040
 they reverse the present perversion of the Fan Hugos. So that's good. And I think it is... It's

322
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,920
 very forward-looking to make sure that kind of it doesn't matter what the kind of, you know,

323
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,600
 whether you're writing something down or saying it out loud, it still counts as a fanzine. I think

324
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,600
 that is kind of a really good idea. Yeah, well done. Well done, forward-thinking FAAN award

325
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,920
 administrator Nic Farey. I don't know whether it was Nic that came up with it. I assume it...

326
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,560
 I don't know whether is this the first time this is the definition. Do we know? Nic, if you're

327
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:16,000
 listening, please write in. Yes. Or anyone else who is involved with the FAAN awards. Because I don't know

328
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,640
 the answer to that. And I don't want to look it up now because Liz will never get her dinner. And then

329
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:28,080
 on the subject of defining awards, Alison has joined a Discord. And usually this would not be

330
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,520
 news for the podcast. But in this case, it is. I have joined the Hugo Awards Study Committee

331
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:42,720
 Discord. The business meeting remitted the Hugo Awards Study Committee to go away and look at

332
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,480
 best audiobook and also a couple of other things. And in general, consider whether any

333
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,560
 changes were needed to Hugo category definitions and report back next year with some proposals.

334
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,200
 So the chair is appointed by the business meeting and then the chair gets to appoint other people.

335
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:07,600
 The chair wants to have a good and open discussion but doesn't want to open it up to the entire

336
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:15,440
 set of people on the internet who might be interested in Hugos. I mean, I think he basically doesn't want

337
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,800
 a hundred... He doesn't want a cheering squad for Best Audiobook to turn up or something like that.

338
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,640
 He wants to get people who will consider carefully and dispassionately what sorts of things are needed

339
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,800
 and why. However, he's given us an email that you can get in touch, if you're interested. So

340
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,600
 thank you Cliff. That was very helpful. Cliff Dunn is the chair. So far it's been very,

341
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,720
 I think, pretty civilised. People have come up with some things in a number of categories. As we know,

342
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,720
 Bob, I am very interested in making sure that a good proposal for Best Game goes to the business

343
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,120
 meeting along with a big following wind of people who think that it's a good idea amongst the people

344
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,160
 who will be at the business meeting in Chicago. So that's one of the reasons I'm there. But I'm also

345
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,400
 going to watch and if there's anything very interesting coming out of it, I will report back.

346
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:10,080
 Are you allowed to report back? Doesn't say I can't. What are those funny rules?

347
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,080
 Chatham House rules? How Chatham House rules is it? They haven't said it's Chatham House rules. Well I'm not

348
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,640
 going to say... You know, XYZ said exactly this. Chatham House rules, incidentally, allow you to report

349
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,360
 things just not with... not attributed things. Yeah. I mean, I don't think I'm not attending to

350
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,640
 cut and paste stuff out of the Discord. Yeah, I mean, my thought is just like, it feels like the

351
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,360
 Hugo Award Study Committee has lost a bunch of momentum. I mean, fair enough, pandemic and all that.

352
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:44,240
 But it kind of did some big reporting probably in 2019 and then really hasn't kind of done much since

353
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,160
 then. So it would be good to get some stuff, some good proposals out over this year. I need to rewind.

354
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,280
 It is not a standing committee. I'm actually surprised John didn't pitch in here. The Hugo Award Study

355
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,080
 Committee is not a standing committee of WSFS, which only has one standing committee, which is

356
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,080
 the Mark Protection Committee. Depends how you count. It is instead an ad hoc committee

357
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,480
 and it comes and goes and it has gone away for a bit and now it is back.

358
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,520
 Did it go away or did they just keep renewing it and it didn't do anything?

359
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,720
 No, it reported and then it went away. So this business meeting appointed a new chair

360
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,480
 who I think was the same as the old chair. To get an answer, we'd have to look through lots of

361
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,280
 minutes of business meetings to find out when various committees were done and we've been recording

362
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:38,800
 for fifty-five minutes. So we're not going to do that. So I don't really believe in New Year's resolutions

363
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,000
 but I have a lot of them. I don't believe in them. John has been going on about the way in which I

364
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,560
 never read science fiction and I thought, you know, you're not wrong. We have picks to do every

365
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,840
 fortnight on Octothorpe but I thought it would be quite good if at least half of those picks were

366
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:01,920
 science fiction books or fantasy books. That's like... that commits me to 13 books in 2022 so that's

367
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,800
 not impossible. And I also have a load of things around, you know, eating better and doing more

368
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,280
 exercise and getting more sleep and drinking less beer and all the normal sorts of New Year's

369
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,000
 resolution things. And I have resolved to play somewhat fewer mindless video games. I don't know

370
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,160
 whether it will work. So that's where I'm going to get a load of new time from. It's going to be good.

371
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:35,840
 I had some New Year's resolutions in 2021 which were to publish 12 issues of Lulzine, which I did.

372
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,760
 And to get an app in the App Store which I didn't but I did get it into beta testing so I feel like...

373
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,920
 It's why I'm drinking less alcohol John. Yay. So my resolutions are broadly similar. The

374
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,120
 Lulzine one's gotten off to a little bit of a bad start because we haven't yet commissioned

375
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,640
 an article for the first issue of 2022. If you want to write something about funny

376
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,080
 things please write in, listeners, because that would be useful. But yeah so kind of keep plugging

377
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,720
 on with the fanac and keep plugging on with my app. So that'll be good hopefully. I've also got my

378
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,280
 standard board game challenge which I don't really think of as a New Year's resolution but

379
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,440
 which I guess is and this year I'm going to play 10 games 10 times. Last year I just played games

380
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,080
 100 times and was not limited to like you know from these games but this time I'm doing what's

381
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:30,480
 called a 10 by 10 challenge in the community to try and get some of my games that I have a lot of

382
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,080
 expansions for to the table more often so I will report back as we go through the year.

383
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:41,280
 I am also doing board games and I did a 22 by 10 challenge which sounds like an awful lot.

384
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,880
 She's mad. But in fact they're solo, print-and-play, roll-and-write games and a lot of them are

385
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,440
 very very quick so I think it's going to be okay but I don't know yet I'll report back.

386
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,360
 Yeah so board games are also a challenge for me and I'm not actually buying... well I bought a few of

387
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,240
 them but I'm not printing any of them. I'm doing them all on my iPad so it's kind of a...

388
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,560
 it's trying to give me board games without the actual buying big cardboard boxes that then sit in my

389
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,680
 house for the rest of time part of the whole board game experience which is a problem for me.

390
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,560
 The board games I'm going to be playing are Android: Netrunner, Legendary: Marvel,

391
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,520
 Mansions of Madness, Marvel: Champions, Star Wars: Destiny, Under Falling Skies, Arkham Horror (3rd Edition),

392
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,600
 Star Wars: X-Wing, Star Wars: Imperial Assault and Arkham Horror: The Card Game and I am

393
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:38,080
 seven games into my hundred games so far so I am ahead of the curve. But yeah. It's going well.

394
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:44,000
 I'm enjoying it. Haven't played X-Wing in ages so it was good to kind of get back on that horse

395
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,960
 and try out the new rules which was cool. Are there horses in the Star Wars universe?

396
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,120
 There are dogs. There are like those Tauntaun things. No but there are literally dogs because

397
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,480
 the novelisation of Star Wars: A New Hope Luke says that he misses his dog. True fact.

398
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,080
 Doesn't say space dog, just dog. Also Earth is in the Star Wars universe because of the Star

399
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:13,840
 Tours ride so Wookiepedia has entries for both dogs and Earth. Fact. Liz do you have any New Year's

400
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:20,800
 resolutions? I don't really do New Year's resolutions. I think I am less driven by being able to tick

401
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,120
 stuff off than you guys are so I don't generally do them. I do always set myself like a Goodreads

402
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,560
 number of books I would quite like to read and then quite often don't make it but I have done

403
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,520
 that again this year and set myself, you know, a target of 80 books. How is that not ticking things

404
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,880
 off? It is, she just thinks it isn't. It is and I do record like the books... it's mostly to make

405
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,360
 me record the books I read so I can remember what I've read but if I don't get to 80 I don't actually

406
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,640
 mind. Like I sort of treat it as that would be a nice number. Oh yes I should say that's also true

407
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,520
 of my New Year's resolutions that I don't beat myself up too much when I fail, which I inevitably do.

408
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,520
 For me it's the choice between having some sort of vague goal for the year or just spending the

409
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,320
 entire time aimlessly scrolling on Facebook and I'd rather have a vague goal but I'm not going to,

410
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,880
 you know, cry in a corner for a day if I don't meet the vague goal I just find it useful to have

411
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,160
 some structure. Yeah I just aimlessly scroll on Facebook. Winning! Should we do picks?

412
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:27,440
 Why not? I have read a science fiction book. It's a 2021 science fiction book

413
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:36,640
 so... but it's not a novel I mean there will be more novels I'm sure but this is Sinopticon,

414
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,000
 a celebration of Chinese science fiction translated and edited by Xueting Christine Ni

415
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,720
 and you're going to need to go and get it from a website that I will definitely put in the show notes

416
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,440
 because I don't think it's generally distributed. It is a collection of... or it's an anthology of 13 stories

417
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,760
 and they have like little afterwords from the editor and translator where she's explained

418
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,960
 why she chose to put those ones in which is also very interesting. And I like the fact

419
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:12,320
 they're afterwords because sometimes I read the story going, "Oh no they're not going there". I mean

420
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:19,200
 so it's extremely interesting because of all the cultural stuff. As science fiction

421
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,080
 some of the stories are more interesting than others. Some of the stories are interesting in the

422
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:32,000
 way that they've chosen a science fictional trope to illustrate a facet of Chinese society which I

423
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,120
 think is really really good. It's all sorts of different things in here. There are old stories,

424
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:44,240
 new stories, forward-thinking stories, incredibly backwards-thinking stories. There's a lot of

425
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:53,200
 stuff that reads in a very heteronormative way compared to what you'd expect in modern science

426
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,880
 fiction now so some of it really feels like it's reflecting some of the science fiction of my youth

427
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,680
 and I really enjoyed it and I would strongly recommend it. I read She Who Became the Sun by

428
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:10,320
 Shelley Parker Chan which is a 2021 fantasy novel and it mainly is an interesting counterpoint to

429
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:17,360
 what you were just saying Alison because it is basically a retelling of the founding of the Ming

430
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:26,720
 dynasty but a very genderqueer one so it's all set in the China of the 14th

431
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:34,320
 century and it follows, basically, a peasant daughter who is told that her fate is to be nothing

432
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:41,760
 but when her brother dies, whose fate was to be great, she decides to essentially take over

433
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:50,320
 his identity. She takes his name. So Zhu Chongba then goes and joins a monastery, ends up

434
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:58,480
 joining the rise of the rebels against the Mongol Emperor. All the while disguised as her

435
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,760
 brother. And then kind of the opposing figure in the novel is the general who commands the Mongol

436
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:13,760
 forces, Ouyang, who is a eunuch. So essentially you have like these two opposing forces who both

437
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:20,000
 have very different kind of responses to their their gender and how people see them and how people

438
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,360
 view them and treat them and how they personally feel about it and just kind of... It's a very nice

439
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:31,120
 way of putting a different interpretation on this kind of known historical setting.

440
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:40,160
 It is fantasy but quite lightly fantasy I would say. The main thing is that the main character can

441
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,440
 can see ghosts and there is this idea that you get a mandate from heaven to rule which is actually

442
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,240
 kind of manifested as a physical flame. So that's the kind of fantasy elements other than that it's

443
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,560
 just kind of this big sort of historical epic of armies and battles and political machinations

444
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,680
 and assassinations and conquering and trying to essentially take over the entire empire but I

445
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,640
 think you have these two very interesting central characters. So I read that, I enjoyed that. It is the

446
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,320
 first one of a series but I think it works fairly well as a standalone in that you get you know the

447
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,280
 first chunk of of the rise to power and you know you can see what's going to happen...

448
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,680
 You can see that the next book will be about the next stage of the rise to power but you

449
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,640
 you're happy with it as a standalone and it is also a 2021 book and I think Shelley Parker Chan is

450
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:34,960
 also eligible for the Astounding Award. You guys are reading your old science fiction from last year

451
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,600
 but I'm here to do a pick from this year like a modern person because I watched the finale of the

452
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:48,400
 Expanse and I very much enjoyed it. It's done, it's finished, with a slight asterisk because I think

453
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,400
 they might be trying to make more but I'm not sure how that's going to go. But yes, it wrapped up and

454
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,760
 I thought it was good I thought they mostly stuck the landing. There are a few things that happen in

455
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,520
 season six which kind of obliquely referred things that are being set up for the later books and I

456
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,200
 think they are going to try to get the later books made in some form or another but I'm not quite sure

457
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,080
 how that's going to work. But in general I thought despite that being a little bit of a annoying

458
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,400
 thing in the last season, the last season was very good and I really enjoyed myself and really

459
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:28,160
 enjoyed watching it all come to an end. And certainly one of the better endings I've seen in SF genre

460
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:35,680
 TV series in well... Really since I've been paying attention, but yes, it kind of didn't set all

461
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,600
 fandom on fire immediately which for a long-running science fiction TV show is actually pretty good

462
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:46,320
 going. Looking at you, Game of Thrones. Looking at you, Lost. Looking at you, Battlestar Galactica.

463
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:53,680
 So yes, hurrah! Didn't screw it up! Well done, guys. I was gonna say, "Looking at you, Mass Effect

464
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:02,000
 Trilogy", the ending so bad they had to patch it out. That was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye

465
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:17,920
 from me. It's goodbye from me. And it's goodbye from me.

466
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,760
 I think that's it, really. We could do, "That was the Octothorpe podcast", and then Liz can eat.

467
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,520
 It's all right it's only 6:45 I'm not gonna get hangry till 7.

468
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,960
 Excellent! Let's doss about for 15 minutes and really push our luck. No!

469
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:45,520
 I have just found on Shelley Parker Chan's website little pronunciations of the character names

470
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,280
 so I'm just gonna check in case I you have to drop in Ouyang. You probably do. It should be Ouyang

471
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,000
 You probably can't drop that in but anyway I just thought I'd mention that as it's super neat

472
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,120
 because I was like I do not know properly how to pronounce these names and I had not known

473
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,560
 that was there but it's a just a neat thing at the bottom of the press kit. It's like, here is how you

474
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,880
 pronounce the five main characters. The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin
