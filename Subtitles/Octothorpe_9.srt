1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 Can you turn off your virtual background just because I like to see the cat?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,880
 1, 2, 3...

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,720
 *clap*

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,960
 Okay, that'll do.

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,840
 *laughs*

6
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,680
 Right.

7
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,520
 John, the cat behind you, which everyone is, like, when we did the clap, the little head came up.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,800
 And then they were like, "Oh, nothing's going on, I'll put my head back down again."

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:29,440
 *music*

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:37,440
 Hello everyone, and welcome to the ninth episode of the OgtThought Podcast, a podcast about science fiction and SF fandom.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
 I'm John Coxson.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,960
 I'm Alison Scott, and I'm Liz Batty.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,960
 And this week we have letters of comment that have arrived since the previous episode.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,600
 And we actually have three letters of comment, a comment of comment, and a reciprocal letter of comment sort of.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,000
 So, firstly, Helena McCallum writes in to say that you can set locks if you're not called Mark Orandrew.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,600
 I like this as in it's a sort of meta letter of comment, in that it's telling us a thing and also doing that thing at the same time.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,520
 So I prove.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
 But we had in fact already had letters of comment from Claire.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,120
 Yes, that is true.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,600
 Who is not called Andrew or Mark.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
 But we had a lot of marks and a lot of Andries.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I think there are now an equal number of letters of comment from people called Mark, people called Andrew, and women.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
 And that may be something we want to address at some point.

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,000
 Maybe we need to be diversifying our relationship.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
 We're like the board of directors of accompanying, aren't we?

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,600
 Yeah.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:47,840
 Graham Chanuk used to braid his female readers every episode about their inability to write letters of comment to his fanzine vibrator.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
 Yeah, that seems.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,880
 I tell you what, there are some clueless people out there in the world.

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,680
 I think we will be coming on to that later.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,840
 Mark, someone called Mark did also set us a letter of comment to keep us in letters of comment from people called Mark.

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:11,520
 And he says that he is most disappointed that we had omitted letters of comment from people called Mark.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,440
 And he accuses me of having transitioned from the Mark Protection Committee to the Mark Neglection League.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:26,240
 So I would like to publicly apologise to all marks and to admit that I have not done a good enough job of protecting their feelings and their opinions.

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,640
 And I will rededicate myself to the Mark Protection Committee from this day forth.

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
 Well said.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,840
 He also says that he thinks I'm wrong about the Wussfuss Business Meeting.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:46,640
 And perhaps a bare minimum business meeting is the right way to go given the state of the world at the moment and the amount of work the Conzeland Committee are probably doing to make Conzeland happen.

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
 And that is a good point.

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
 Um, yes.

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
 So basically he agrees with me on that.

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
 Yes.

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,040
 He says, he says, "Allison and Liz, I don't mean to neglect you, but you seemed pretty clear that you're holding.

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,040
 Doctor Hugo Award finalist Mark neglecting the boy Cox and responsible here keep on casting.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,240
 So props to you to all of the criticism directed in my direction.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
 Correctly.

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
 Yes.

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,240
 I mean, I can't say it. I can't say it's not reasonable.

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:28,240
 However, I had some vitriolic criticism directed this, my way, this fortnight from one Lillian Edwards who accused me of accused all three of us of not mentioning her new podcast.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,240
 This never happens, which she is doing with Christina, Lakerdy and Sorenson.

51
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
 And there will be a link in the show notes.

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
 It's very good. You should go and listen to it.

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,040
 And we are not, we are completely unapologetic about the fact that we did not mention this podcast last time because we recorded our previous.

54
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:52,040
 Episode on the 17th of June and she released the podcast of the world on the 18th of June.

55
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,040
 So we would have to have been more than usually prescient to have mentioned it.

56
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,040
 So Lillian, tough. We are mentioning it now. Is that good enough? I claim my five pounds.

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:16,040
 I mean, what I like about that is that you address her criticism with tact and kindness in a way that definitely won't stoke any fires.

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
 So that's good.

59
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,040
 Isn't Stoking Fars what it's all about?

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 It could well be. It could well be.

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,040
 So, and also, I think the other mark asked us to say when we're recording it.

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,040
 We're recording this one on Sunday the 5th of July and it'll go out on Wednesday the 8th of July unless it doesn't.

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,040
 Yes, all being well unless it doesn't.

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:43,040
 Why this podcast is not late? It turns out to be easier to get podcasts out on time than Fansies, which is something I had not realised.

65
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:55,040
 I mean, so I'm just going to say, and obviously this comes from a place of love, but I suspect it is also easier to get podcasts out when you have your co-host do the editing of the podcast.

66
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
 On time.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
 On time.

68
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,040
 How many podcasts? How many Fansies have you done? Professor the boy, Coxon?

69
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
 Me?

70
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,040
 Of the top of my head.

71
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
 On time.

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
 Twenty.

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
 Maybe on time.

74
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
 What is time?

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
 Time is an illusion.

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
 Fansies is doubly so.

77
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
 Time is fleeting.

78
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,040
 So Claire wrote us a letter of comment.

79
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,040
 Claire Broily wrote us a letter of comment to commend us for pronouncing her surname correctly.

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,040
 And said she was going to be quieted this week also.

81
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,040
 So yes, thank you, Claire.

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:37,040
 Please send your Claire Hughes on the topic of Claire Broily to octathookast@gmail.com.

83
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,040
 Oh no, that's such a terrible joke.

84
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,040
 Or in fact, any other regular correspondent.

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,440
 Finally, two of us were at the first Thursday meeting on the first Thursday and Crazy Dave

86
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,440
 told us that he listens to this podcast at two and a half time speed.

87
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,760
 So we are curious to know whether he is the fastest podcast listener in our audience.

88
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,160
 So if you are listening at greater than two and a half time speed, please write in and

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
 let us know.

90
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,720
 And also tell us how an earth you managed to make sense of what's going on because I

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
 tried it.

92
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,160
 I just, I know what we're saying and I can't hear it.

93
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
 So.

94
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,400
 Whenever I listen to podcasts, I listen at normal speed or sometimes 1.1, but normally

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,280
 normal speed because I feel that podcasts are designed to entertain it.

96
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,520
 If they're not entertaining at regular speed, I'll go off and find what it is.

97
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,760
 Don't tell people that.

98
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,280
 They'll stop listening to our podcast, Alison.

99
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
 They could listen.

100
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
 You're very welcome to listen to this podcast.

101
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
 It's good though.

102
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,880
 Imagine if you could listen to like rambling chats in the bar at 2.5 times speed.

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,920
 There would no longer be sort of like four hours of rambling chat over a point.

104
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
 It would be like a breezy one hour discussion.

105
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,040
 Yes, and you would be taking shots of vodka to replicate.

106
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,400
 I feel that Zoom is Mr. Trick here.

107
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
 Well, because it doesn't come with vodka.

108
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
 No, no.

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
 Zoom needs smart speed.

110
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,080
 I'm in this zoom chat, but it's really a bit boring.

111
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:09,520
 Let's speed it up a bit.

112
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,400
 The details for my guff-tripper all taking shape, and I will be on it next time.

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:25,720
 So we may have to organise when to record in a way that ties in with my virtually swimming

114
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,800
 off the Great Barrier Reef or something like that.

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,320
 I've got lots of plans to go spend time in bars with people who are not socially, not

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,800
 required to social distance.

117
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,080
 So I don't know to what extent things are really back to normal in Australia and New

118
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 Zealand.

119
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,040
 I think they are more back to normal, except in Melbourne, which is one of the main places

120
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,960
 I'm going, which has had another outbreak.

121
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,000
 So who knows what's going to happen?

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,640
 And anyway, you see, we'll get my next report from not Australia, but virtually Australia.

123
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,560
 And I will tell you all about the exciting things I'm doing there as part of the first

124
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,120
 part of reporting on a virtual guff trip.

125
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,920
 So when does your virtual guff-tripper begin, Alison?

126
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,120
 It starts on the 11th, which is really not very long.

127
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,200
 Oh, wow, that's the week.

128
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,520
 I've got, yeah, less than a week.

129
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,800
 And normally I'd be like panicking and packing at this point, but in fact I'm actually doing

130
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,200
 all the stuff I didn't get around to earlier because as it's virtual, it's easier.

131
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,080
 I hope to get it all sorted.

132
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
 Fair enough.

133
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,560
 And on your...

134
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,360
 So you're starting on the 11th.

135
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,080
 When does your virtual trip come to a close?

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:40,160
 Well, I finish with Conzeland and then I will be not flying home.

137
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,280
 And I think that's the time we actually have to sort out a recording because I think I'm

138
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,760
 going to not stay with this on my way home and we're going to record Octa Thorpe as if

139
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
 I was in this living room.

140
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
 So that won't be the next one.

141
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,480
 It'll be the one after, I think, after Conzeland and you'll be going, "What were your impressions

142
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 of virtual Conzeland?"

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
 And I'll be going, "I am completely connected.

144
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,480
 I'm completely knackered in my eyes square now."

145
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,960
 Yes, that's fair.

146
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:15,960
 So there will be more firm details about our live from Alison's trip home recording in

147
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
 the next episode.

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:25,160
 So keep your eyes peeled for that.

149
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,440
 Shall we talk about Conzeland?

150
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,360
 We often do, but yes, let's do it again.

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,800
 I saw a tweet several weeks ago, which I have now lost, but it was that Conzeland were looking

152
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,320
 for people to help with access.

153
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,320
 And specifically, the issues of access which would come up when you are a virtual convention,

154
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,800
 which I think is quite interesting because it feels like we're starting to get a handle

155
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,640
 on what conventions can do to make themselves more accessible to people who are actually

156
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,800
 at the convention.

157
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,600
 But obviously moving online is going to bring a whole new set of issues.

158
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,800
 And I'd be interested to know if you have any thoughts on them.

159
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,080
 If you've been to any virtual conventions or meetups, which did think about ways to make

160
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,400
 them more accessible to people who find it difficult to access virtual conventions and

161
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
 any other thoughts on the matter.

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,440
 Well, it's funny you should say this.

163
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,480
 So I've been doing first Thursday meetups for London fans.

164
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,840
 When we started, we very quickly noticed that we were getting quite a lot of people attending

165
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:38,400
 who could not attend the first Thursday in person, sometimes for reasons of distance,

166
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:45,080
 which is not actually a primary accessibility issue for what we think of as being a local

167
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,000
 London pub meeting.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,040
 So it's nice that these people can now come, but it's not what I think of as the most important

169
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,400
 accessibility issue for the thing.

170
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,080
 But we also have had people visiting who cannot normally attend the meeting either because

171
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,080
 they do not like crowded pubs or they cannot get up the stairs.

172
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,920
 And so having those people there is very welcome.

173
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,920
 We have then, since then, been trying to do outreach, and we've done this on a very

174
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,600
 individual basis, and we've done outreach to the people who we know normally attend

175
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,040
 the first Thursday meetings, but have not been attending the Zoom meetings.

176
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,240
 We've had a range of responses.

177
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,120
 So some of them have come and tried it, and some of them quite like it.

178
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,000
 Some of them have tried Zoom, but concluded that they don't like large zooms, even if

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,080
 we do the breakout room thing, that they are preferring there, even though they might quite

180
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,400
 enjoy conventions.

181
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,480
 They are preferring to do the interactive meetups in smaller groups.

182
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:53,200
 People are still struggling with technology.

183
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,840
 Most of this virtual life that we are living now, it is much worse than a regular pub

184
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,840
 meeting would be, and often also than the formal panels and presentations at conventions,

185
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,360
 they are finding it harder.

186
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
 It is harder to lip read.

187
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,440
 It is harder to manage the complexity of conversation where several people are in a

188
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
 room.

189
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:23,560
 Some people don't like Zoom, some people can't manage Zoom, some people have disabilities

190
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,640
 that are more or differently disabling in a Zoom environment.

191
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,800
 But you know, it is something we've given some thought to.

192
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,240
 And actually for a lot of the older people, just helping them individually get into this

193
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,200
 way of working is the thing that is most useful.

194
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,320
 So the thing that popped into my head immediately was the problem that you would have if you

195
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,760
 were hard of hearing with this kind of technology.

196
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:00,000
 And I think one of the reasons I got quite annoyed at the Hugo ceremony in Dublin because

197
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,920
 they had the automatic subtitles people were laughing when they got it wrong.

198
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,520
 But the problem with that is that it means that they said, "Oh, we should not have used

199
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,440
 automatic subtitles because they were inviting people to find them funny."

200
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,920
 And I kind of thought that maybe when we see automatic subtitles that are inadvertently

201
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,160
 saying the wrong things, we need to shut the hell up and remember that these subtitles

202
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,840
 are there as an accessibility feature for deaf people and not laugh in a way that means

203
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,320
 that convention committees want to take that away for the deaf community.

204
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,440
 So my thought, Sisson, is that one, you are quite right, that if we see something on automatic

205
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,160
 subtitles, we do need to remember, look, these are here for a purpose there to help

206
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,120
 people and we shouldn't, you know, we should try not to react in that way because it's

207
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,600
 not helpful.

208
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,240
 And that I can see that when you're doing an all online convention, there are auto-subtitling

209
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,880
 options that might help.

210
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,840
 But my second thought is that for big events like the Hugo's, you should really be paying

211
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,440
 for a live captioner because these problems will not happen.

212
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,000
 And we know that is possible.

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,240
 It takes money, but it doesn't take enormous vast amounts of money that world comes, cannot

214
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,560
 allocate to it.

215
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,760
 And that would have solved that particular problem.

216
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,080
 I think in smaller groups, that is less of a problem because I think the problem with

217
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,440
 the Hugo's is one person finds it a bit funny and then everyone around them starts to realize

218
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,600
 what they're laughing about and that spreads.

219
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,000
 So maybe that's not a problem if it's only 30 people watching live captioning of a panel

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 or so on.

221
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,960
 But I was slightly surprised that they use the auto-subtitling option for the Hugo's

222
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,600
 instead of going with a person in the auditorium or else we're doing it for them.

223
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 That's fair.

224
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,960
 I think that's a good point.

225
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,440
 I think that's less relevant to a virtual thing because the people who need automatic

226
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,280
 subtitling will use it.

227
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,920
 I also feel that laughing at automatic subtitling is the equivalent of laughing at a presenter

228
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:07,800
 whose first language is not English or who has a spasticity that means that they can't

229
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,480
 form words or move in a normal way and it's completely reprehensible.

230
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,840
 And if all you need to do to stop it happening is to say we're having these captions to help

231
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:25,520
 people who have poor hearing hear the thing and I understand that some of you are finding

232
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,000
 it funny but please keep that to yourselves and people would have shut up.

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,600
 I think your argument, I think the problem is that if you laugh at someone on stage who

234
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,840
 has a problem speaking or problem communicating, you're clearly laughing at someone who has

235
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:50,520
 feelings whereas laughing at an automatic transcription doesn't have a victim and doesn't have as

236
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,960
 obvious a victim and so I think it is much easier to laugh at that because it doesn't

237
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,880
 feel like you're being cruel.

238
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,200
 I see why people might laugh at one or not the other but yeah and I think Liz's point

239
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,680
 about the hugos especially being able to afford a person to do it which would not necessarily

240
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,520
 run into the same problems.

241
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,880
 Especially as a word ceremonies often have a lot of text which is pre-written and can

242
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,520
 just be spewed out, you don't have to live caption anything except the acceptance speeches.

243
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,680
 Yes and it means you can send them the names of all the finalists in advance.

244
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,120
 They could have put that into the automatic transcription software too just saying.

245
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,240
 I actually had another subsidiary point about the other thing Alice has said.

246
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,520
 I was just going to say that obviously the first Thursday mechanism of individually contacting

247
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:51,000
 members who are having trouble and helping them in a one to one setting scales poorly

248
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,120
 to world's cotton levels of attendance.

249
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,920
 Okay here's how you do it.

250
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,520
 You ask people to talk to their friends who are having trouble and you also encourage local

251
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,160
 things like the first Thursday to happen because if those things are happening in lots of

252
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,760
 different places that is a way to preload lots of people.

253
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,080
 So you encourage the grassroots activities that's required.

254
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,880
 In fact Conziel and I think are doing training sessions to get people familiar with their

255
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,400
 platforms before the com which I think is a great way of doing it and that is also going

256
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,160
 to open up access so you can log in, you'll be able to log in I think to their Discord

257
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,480
 and things and check them out ahead of time to make sure your chosen device is going to

258
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,360
 work nicely with everything and so you don't spend the first day of your convention trying

259
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
 to fiddle with Zoom I guess.

260
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,240
 Have they announced this or have they just, is this just one of these we are intending

261
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,240
 to do this stuff because I've just, I've finally got around to filling in my program

262
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,720
 participant form.

263
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,040
 Sorry Jenny, you had said it to me and I am just terrible.

264
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,880
 You are the bane of program, you are the bane of program heads everywhere Alice and

265
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,480
 it has a thing saying would you like to moderate a panel and I said if you insist because I

266
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,760
 know that although I'm not the world's best moderator there's always a shortage of female

267
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,800
 moderators and I think that it is better to have less good female moderators than better

268
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:24,400
 male moderators controversial opinion and so and then they said would you be happy to

269
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,120
 attend a training session and I'm kind of like yes of course but they do have to fit that

270
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,560
 training session in around my virtual guff trip and so time is getting tight, touch the

271
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,400
 unusual I feel for the world con.

272
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,160
 There are a few things where I'm kind of like oh you're cutting it a bit fine now.

273
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,880
 I thought they had said this but now I mention it of course I cannot actually find any of

274
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,920
 the information on it or did they email it to me that might be it.

275
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,120
 It is interesting since we have started podcasting I have become much more interested in conventions

276
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,000
 official lines of communication because that is how I try and find out what conventions

277
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,200
 are doing and so whenever there is something I know about a convention that is not in their

278
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,120
 official line of communication I'm like why have you not put this on your website in a

279
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,280
 place that it is easy to find?

280
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,880
 Conventions often put quite a lot of control over their official communication routes in

281
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,680
 a way that makes it hard for say area heads to actually get in there and amend the things

282
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:30,040
 for their own area rapidly so you can often have a area heads who are very happy to keep

283
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:36,960
 the information for their area up to date who are prevented from doing so by the broader

284
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,120
 controls over what goes on the website and that is not it is not a stupid thing to do

285
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,200
 there are arguments on both sides of this but my view is that if you trust somebody to

286
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,800
 be an area head you should probably trust them to update their webpage too.

287
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,960
 I have now found the announcement and it was in my email and it probably says something

288
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,640
 about me that I immediately tried to find it on Facebook and Twitter and their official

289
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,360
 page before I just went and read the email which I read this afternoon but yes it does

290
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,480
 say you can ask if there's a form to fill in if you would like to have some live training

291
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,800
 on Discord which I think is a great initiative.

292
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,720
 I think it is a great initiative I will point out that anyone who has not joined New Zealand

293
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,120
 because they feel they cannot use the technology is perhaps in need of this being announced

294
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,400
 more widely than emails to people who have joined Conzeland.

295
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,040
 I'm not technically a Conzeland member I'm just on their mailing list of people who have

296
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,720
 expressed interest at some point so it may be is going to a wider group there.

297
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:43,120
 Yeah and I'm well taken I'm actually interestingly as a Conzeland member why does it not get

298
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,040
 that email.

299
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:52,440
 So you know I think that all of these things make sense in terms of how World Con divisions

300
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,120
 are put together and they are all volunteers doing these jobs and like you know I completely

301
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,800
 see how all of this has happened but I do think at some point that needs to be a little

302
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,200
 bit of a thought about whether or not these are sensible structures and whether or not

303
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,400
 there is a better way to structure these things.

304
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,880
 I realise that as someone who is identifying this problem and not volunteering for a World

305
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,960
 Con not that I definitely part of the precipitate in this regard in that I am not part of the

306
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,440
 solution but.

307
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,440
 Shall we talk about Hugo voting?

308
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,240
 Yeah it hasn't started yet.

309
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,040
 I have had informal conversations with people who may not be connected with the people who

310
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,200
 have to actually count up the hugas who are like we think the time is now getting quite

311
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
 tight for the management of the Hugo vote.

312
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,200
 So this is my question because I well I agree that the time is getting very tight for Hugo

313
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,960
 voting since it is not open yet and they are going to present them at the end of the month.

314
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,360
 But also I do not know how many people actually vote throughout the voting process and how

315
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,280
 many people try and log in 10 minutes before they end the voting and frantically vote for

316
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,600
 everything. So I don't know whether this delay will actually be lowering the number of Hugo

317
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,360
 votes or just compressing everything into a two week window when it would probably be compressed

318
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,000
 into anyway.

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,040
 This is my question because when people were discussing this I was like I can see that having

320
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,520
 fewer votes is a problem but it was less clear to me whether or not this would end up in there

321
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,280
 being less votes if that makes sense.

322
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,160
 So yeah I completely see your point.

323
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,520
 It also prevents you from doing neat little things like having the best novel Hugo presented

324
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,840
 by a female astronaut and other tricks like this.

325
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,280
 It's quite useful to have the hugas in the bag well before the welcome.

326
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,360
 It used to be that this would have been completely impossible because the process of Hugo voting

327
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,120
 involved a voting phase and then a counting phase that was long and extremely complicated

328
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,880
 and I believe that now that we have very few postal votes the counting phase is very quick

329
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,880
 but people are still entitled to vote by poster they cannot do that so they can.

330
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,640
 They can. The paper ballots have been up since the nominees were announced.

331
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
 It is only the online voting that is not available.

332
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,680
 Sorry that that ruins the run.

333
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,200
 In that case ignore me I'm talking about but it's still impossible because you can't actually

334
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,720
 post anything to New Zealand with any confidence it will arrive at the moment so you know.

335
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,680
 Oh yeah I do I do sort of think that if you're casting a postal vote across the Pacific Ocean

336
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:41,200
 during Covid-19 that may not be the most reliable mechanism but yes.

337
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,320
 I like that Covid-19 is this kind of like the 2019 Hugo's in the Tits voted in

338
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,560
 awarded in 2020. Okay.

339
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:57,760
 So this is an interesting this is an ecumenical matter. The 2020 Hugo's are awarded in 2020 for

340
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,720
 works in 2019. That's right sorry these things vary quite a lot but I think it's 2019 Oscars isn't

341
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,360
 it? I never know these things. Everyone does it differently there is no consensus.

342
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:14,640
 It is it is quite interesting in that it is it is clear that they will get it together

343
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,880
 we think but if they don't get it together it's going to be spectacular. I think there's

344
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
 quite a big risk that they get it together in in between when we record this and when the

345
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,120
 show is released so well done guys that was that was well timed mess up our podcast.

346
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,720
 They have announced the voting will open no later than Wednesday the 8th of July so it should be

347
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,560
 open by the time this podcast is released. I'm not sure it's um it's going to be a problem in

348
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,200
 practice because I don't think really you need a 13 period that's longer than a week um it'll be

349
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,080
 fine they'll develop all the hugos. I do feel a bit sorry for the guys who have to engrave the

350
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,000
 days on the basis as well but they're probably used to this sort of thing. But that's actually fine

351
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,280
 because all the hugos will be being shipped around the world and so they don't necessarily

352
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,760
 have to be ready and engraved on the day of the Hugo ceremony. The introduction of the

353
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:12,160
 e pluribus Hugo um let's make the Hugo voting quite complicated uh amendment also means that

354
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,960
 you absolutely have to do the whole thing digitally anyway and like have software that you've run

355
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,320
 seven or eight times to check it actually works. So I assume that when you just close your

356
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,400
 go voting and then you push a button and then ten minutes later you have the results but maybe

357
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,680
 that's hopefully optimistic. Fingers crossed. That also presumably means that the paper votes are

358
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:39,280
 transmitted uh our data entry into the digital system. I'm pretty sure that's certainly how I

359
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,520
 would do it if I were on the Hugo um a missed a group of Hugo administrators and that is not in

360
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,880
 any way a job application guys. Um I've I've now listened to all the best fan cast so that I can

361
00:25:50,880 --> 00:26:01,280
 write an article for um for um the Glasgow 2024 bid is running some articles on um on hugo slates

362
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,440
 and one of them is Best Fan Cast and I'm writing about it um so we can talk about that next time

363
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,960
 if you like a crossover but I will I will be plugging this podcast there obviously and I

364
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,160
 I can plug Glasgow 2024 they're going to be a great convention. Glasgow's a wonderful place to go

365
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,360
 to for the Worldcon you should vote for them. Does that mean I should listen to all the best

366
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:30,880
 fan casts? At 2.5 speed obviously. Yes it does make me laugh that next episode will be the only

367
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,560
 episode we record um other than this one before the close of voting so we gave an hour

368
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,360
 to Best Mac presentation log form and then we're going to give an hour to all other

369
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:52,000
 Hugo categories which is yes that's our topic for next time all the hugos in an hour starting

370
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,040
 from here yeah all of them we can probably do it we just do like a minute per categories over a

371
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,680
 minute per finalist or we could have like an extra or we could have an extra log episode

372
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,080
 where we talk about all of the categories and people have to add crazy Dave has to run it at

373
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:15,120
 4.6 speed how much of our like uh Star Wars Marvel debate did you go out of the episode jump

374
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,000
 because if you think about it I don't think the rest will be as contentious I think we all agree

375
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,720
 no if you can find a topic on which we all agree we have failed in our podcast setting up a rage

376
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:37,280
 with the other thing we need to talk about with regard to New Zealand is the colonized marginalized

377
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,400
 and historically underrepresented people inclusion initiative which Liz knows about

378
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:49,680
 so Conzeland had a previous scholarship which was for people from marginalized communities to tend

379
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:56,480
 Conzeland in person and so it was aimed at people who were in New Zealand specifically those who

380
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,920
 identified as Maori, Pacifica, people of color um LGBTQI or disabled and I I'm wondering if this is

381
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,600
 now an initiative to expand that given that they're now an online and an online convention where you

382
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,160
 don't need to be there in person so presumably adding people to the virtual convention um is

383
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,560
 less of an issue because you don't have uh limits on your venue capacity and also your your kind of

384
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,200
 marginal costs are minimal it's just kind of expanding your online activities and making sure you have

385
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,360
 the people's support for them um and so they have a new membership upgrade initiative to include

386
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,040
 support the inclusion of colonized marginalized and historically underrepresented people are at

387
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:44,160
 welcome uh which I think is great because that will hopefully allow a lot more people to attend

388
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,120
 virtually um from a lot more different places even more so than when it was actually going to be

389
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,720
 physically in uh New Zealand so I think this is a great initiative it sounds like a good initiative

390
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:03,760
 um like obviously um I think inclusion in conventions is a thing that um is it really important and

391
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,280
 we've talked before about how virtual conventions can be a way to achieve that and it sounds like

392
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,800
 this initiative is kind of putting putting that into practice in a in a way which I think is really

393
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:21,360
 good um it's pretty exciting actually and as I've had numerous conversations with people who are

394
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:29,120
 unable to attend Conziland because of the cost of doing it um some of those people are marginalized

395
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,080
 or from groups that will probably be represented by this and we should put a link in the show notes

396
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,240
 and we should let everyone know that it's happening because this might be you is there a is there a

397
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,680
 deadline for applying for these scholarships nope they're going to say at least weekly as long as

398
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,760
 upgrades last I don't know how long upgrades last but there you go

399
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:59,760
 recently there has been a new wave of stories concerning abuse and harassment in the community

400
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,160
 and a common thread between many of these is the need to be aware of two factors um firstly the

401
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,360
 power dynamic that can exist between more established and less established members of the community

402
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,560
 and uh secondly the fact that conventions are professional environments for professional members

403
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,960
 of the community and there needs to be more awareness of that so this has been on twitter I think

404
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:30,800
 mostly although obviously it has bled into other discussion venues um and I don't think we're going

405
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,280
 to try and link to much because it's very widely distributed and it's very difficult to keep track

406
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:44,880
 of um but we have thoughts I thought this was interesting because I don't have this mindset of

407
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,800
 thinking about conventions as professional spaces because for me the conventions are not

408
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,600
 professional spaces and I do have you know I do there are professional spaces that I go into

409
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,320
 that are conferences in my own field and for me they feel sufficiently different from science

410
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,720
 fiction conventions that I don't really think of conventions in that professional way and so

411
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,960
 I've been thinking about where this might give me um blind spots in particular I think because I

412
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,360
 don't think of them as being professional events for me I don't think of myself as really having

413
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,000
 any power in them when maybe I should because if I am say working on program convention and I

414
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,400
 have a lot of power over who does and who doesn't get lots of panels lots of readings lots for

415
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,520
 cafe clutches how much am I projecting my own biases on there and kind of rewarding professional

416
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,320
 names I know and not rewarding professional names I don't know things like that um is what I think

417
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,440
 of as just being a hobby of setting these things up actually something which can make a difference to

418
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,760
 maybe to the careers of quite junior people who would really like the platform that they can get

419
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,960
 at a convention to try and develop their professional careers and also in that a lot of the issues

420
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,360
 that have been talked about seem to involve interactions in convention bars this gets us back to the I

421
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,160
 think well discussed previously a problem that a lot of interaction does take places in bars and

422
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:16,480
 in particular places with alcohol consumption which obviously is fun for a lot of us but may lead to

423
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,800
 extra problems of how do you keep things professional if you are drinking in the bar with people who

424
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:30,320
 may have the power to help or hinder your career that seems remarkably reasonable I think I want

425
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:37,920
 to go slightly further obviously conventions are for some people a professional space they are not

426
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:44,160
 I think primarily a professional space um we I think we would probably most say that the most

427
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,680
 most possible degree that the most successful conventions um certainly the most successful

428
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:56,160
 larger conventions are a weird hybrid between personal professional space in that although they

429
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:04,080
 were originally set up by fans as a way to spend social time and they are almost exclusively run

430
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,800
 by fans um volunteering to do the organizing it is certainly true that professionals who

431
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,240
 are attending the convention professionally enhance the convention in many ways and as I've just kind

432
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,960
 of started in a tiny little way attending a conventions professional is valid as well as personally

433
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:31,040
 that I do feel that kind of strange the edge of well I would do this but I will not do this because

434
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:37,680
 it is a it is a professional barrier from your or here is this thing that I can I may be able to

435
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,440
 provide a professional service to a convention but is it right for me to provide a professional

436
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,480
 service to that convention while I am also a fan attending the convention um I I feel that it is

437
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,960
 not reasonable to expect everybody in a convention bar in the evening to behave as if they were

438
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,320
 at a professional event and and you would not necessarily want that to happen I think that

439
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:09,760
 I've seen some calls for alcohol and bars at conventions to be um but banned or relegated and I do feel

440
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:18,000
 that that those people are missing the point or certainly the point for me because I am although

441
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,680
 I do do some professional work at cons I am primarily there to um have fun with my mates um I feel

442
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,800
 that at least one of the stories that I've read has arisen out of somebody believing that they

443
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,760
 were engaging in a professional relationship where it's quite possible that the other people involved

444
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,320
 in this primarily saw the relationship as a personal one that didn't contain a professional

445
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,600
 component and I think there is the issue the one where the issue of how much power as a as a

446
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:53,280
 and a very established writer or he did even as a quote big name fowl I am putting big name fan in

447
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:00,240
 actual scarecoats because these things do not actually exist and and it has always been a joke

448
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,440
 I think except obviously it isn't a joke in some ways so and whether people like that do have more

449
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,240
 power than they realize you say about big name fans being a joke and and and I see where you're

450
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,040
 coming from I I don't feel um I don't feel that the fact that I have been in fandom for longer

451
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,400
 than some people gives me any power but it might be that that's because I haven't thought properly

452
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:34,480
 about it what professor hugo nominated mark protector or neglector um the boy um major podcast

453
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,760
 editor the coxern yes this this neatly encapsulates the problem which is if you asked me are you

454
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,880
 powerful I would probably not immediately rush to say yes and I think that means that I

455
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,960
 haven't thought properly about it because I think I do have a I have obviously acutely aware of many

456
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,640
 of my axes of privilege um but I think that is an axis of privilege I have not properly thought

457
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,880
 about and I think the problem with saying oh you know there's not really any such thing as a big

458
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,520
 name fad like I do completely understand where you're coming from but I do wonder whether that is

459
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:16,160
 because we don't properly think about how those power dynamics are actually um in effect in fandom

460
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,160
 because I think if you meet someone I remember the first time you know meeting some fans I

461
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,960
 don't really heard about you do I remember being scared to meet Greg Pickers Gill right you were

462
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,040
 right I'm not necessarily saying he is powerful uh but in some ways he definitely is he had a

463
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,680
 power over me when I was a new fan and it's also very easy for me to forget that I've been fandom

464
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,240
 for 15 years now so I'm not new anymore and I think it's double easy to forget that because there

465
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,560
 are people who have been in fandom a lot longer than me who think I am still new so these are all

466
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:56,800
 really interesting um overlapping power dynamics which are I think quite easy not to think about

467
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,240
 which is bad but you know but there are people there are people there are quite a lot of people

468
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,480
 at the EasterCon who are not very established in their careers who believe very strongly that

469
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,160
 it's very important to be there and I've been on panels with people who I I think were very

470
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:22,480
 introverted writers who almost certainly write very well but who who honestly I think would rather

471
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:30,800
 have been in a bucket of of live crabs for an hour than on an EasterCon panel having to say

472
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,760
 things about things and I did feel very sorry for these people and then again who felt that that

473
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,680
 was part of professional development for a writer yes I mean what I would hope actually is that

474
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,760
 going to EasterCons and other conventions is fun but I would like it if it didn't have that much

475
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,080
 impact on careers yes I would agree with that because I do think it I think it is a bunch of

476
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,920
 the underrepresented people even further because they're not the people who may feel that they are

477
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,520
 able or feel safe in going into a convention bar and you know having a few pints and trying to

478
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,280
 just moves with publishing professionals because also as we've seen it's those people who are

479
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:19,520
 taking the bulk of the harassment in situations where it does go wrong and it is not all kind of

480
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,160
 nice fun and games and there are power imbalances and and the question there is whether the harassment

481
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,920
 or not seriously harassment but whether the unfortunate some of the unfortunate outcomes arise

482
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,880
 from a situation where people who are marginalized to begin with feel that they have to go outside

483
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,120
 their comfort zone in order to gain acceptance in in the community and as a result

484
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,480
 do things that that they probably wouldn't do if they weren't doing them for professional

485
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,920
 reasons and at that point you're into a very difficult situation very difficult situations that

486
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,280
 you know as we know from other industries lead to terrible abuses and I think it's we should be

487
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,520
 clear that convention should be aware of the potential for problems and try and have

488
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:12,080
 good codes of conduct good harassment policies and things to try and mitigate against all these

489
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:19,040
 problems and and obviously listener services and systems so that people who are finding something

490
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:27,920
 is is amiss but at least one of these things that's come out the the incident may happen now and it

491
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:36,640
 may only be years down the line that the ramifications of that come to light I think that's that the

492
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,760
 sort of thing and there's only so much the conventions could do there you know if you're in a position

493
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,200
 of power try not to abuse it try to realize that the person may be talking to you not because they

494
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,840
 like you and think you're marvelous but because they think you may be able to help your career

495
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:58,400
 adapt accordingly that has been the ninth episode of octa thought thank you very much

496
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,640

 so before we leave you we're going to talk a little bit about staying sane in the apocalypse

500
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,640
 so allison what have you been doing to stay sane in the apocalypse the the country seems to have

501
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,840
 decided that we all have to go out to pubs and restaurants and i have not been doing that but i

502
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,840
 have come to visit my parents which is legal as of yesterday so we're here for two nights which i

503
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,800
 believe is allowed within the law and obviously they are getting on so it's quite nice to be

504
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,080
 able to come up and help them with symptoms most of which involve operating systems and i feel like

505
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:02,800
 it's back to being it's the first time i felt that i've done anything that's felt like my normal life

506
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:11,120
 for months on end so that's quite nice but i still think in general i'm not that sane and we are

507
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:17,440
 still in an apocalypse oh and if we're greetings to all our american listeners who are really just

508
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,200
 kind of at the beginning of an apocalypse right now so i'm very worried for america

509
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:28,720
 i mean i think we're actually in several apocalypse is simultaneously but there is one main one but

510
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,200
 personally this week i went to work for two days i worked for my coffee shop one day because all

511
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,000
 the power was going off for the annual electrical check in my apartment and i forgot about this

512
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,120
 until the air conditioning went off one morning um i have also been to a bar although all the bars

513
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,920
 here are already like table service and someone brings you your drinks so i did not like have to go

514
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,480
 and cram up at the bar trying to retrieve my pipes they bring them to you it's obviously civilised

515
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,520
 so it it does feel more like i am doing the normal everyday things i would do them before but i am

516
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,680
 doing them all while wearing a mask so that's obviously a kind of reminder of what's going on

517
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,160
 oh my other thing is that um i happened to be reading the anthology new suns original

518
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,600
 speculative fiction by people of color but edited by niecesheull i haven't reading that this week and

519
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:26,240
 it is very good it's it's it's not a themed anthology it's just an anthology of like excellent speculative

520
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:33,360
 fiction and it it's got a very high hit rate for me and while i was reading it happened to win the

521
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,920
 local award for best anthology so it you should go out and get that i have this day saying in the

522
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:45,680
 apocalypse um by uh it will not surprise anyone to learn playing board games um i recently discovered

523
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:53,040
 the joys of print and play board games i have found a website called docs direct dot com

524
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,800
 you could put your beautiful game cards in the show notes john because they really are a thing

525
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:08,640
 of beauty i was very impressed i purchased i purchased several 300 gsm satin prince various board game

526
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:15,840
 print and play stuff and i bought a corner cutter which makes square corners round and i got my

527
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:22,560
 craft knife and my i would i would say cutting board but i actually use a cardboard envelope

528
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:29,040
 because i am pro and i got on with it and now i have print-a-play board games to play even more

529
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,720
 board games um also it's like kia like kia's still there had to cute again wasn't that bad

530
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,080
 social distancing was fine um most are very good well like kia's always had to go all the way

531
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,560
 around the shop on a one-way system hasn't it yes actually this is one of the things that really

532
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,920
 made it difficult which is the bit immediately upon getting in was very crowded but as soon as you

533
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,640
 got through that bit it was all fine um and the other thing is that my parents are coming to visit

534
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,000
 next week which i am very much looking forward to and there's day in a hotel they're not staying

535
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,600
 with us because our house is small enough that it might be difficult um to do social distancing

536
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,600
 in our house um but yes uh looking forward to that very much

537
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,840
 hurrah for people i haven't seen people in so long i'm still not going as far as going to iKEA

538
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,480
 iKEA can still bring stuff to me on a truck as far as i'm concerned yeah i'm only going into

539
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,840
 shops when it's absolutely essential which means when they sell almond croissants

540
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:32,560
 that's fair no i mean so i would have gotten we have been mostly getting delivery um i will say

541
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:39,520
 the problem is that iKEA's delivery is not um priced if you're just buying like a couple of

542
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,240
 odds and ends for your bathroom the delivery costs are exorbitant if we would be getting like you

543
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,640
 know several bits of furniture i probably would have done that but i just needed like a toilet roll

544
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:55,920
 holder and a mirror and other things like that so so yeah oh it's a good point because iKEA here

545
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,960
 will deliver mine a bit some pieces for about three quid so yeah they just put them in the post

546
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,400
 i've certainly got odd things delivered from iKEA without i think there was one thing we tried

547
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,720
 that they wanted to deliver for the full whack and that's the problem it's if you're bigger than

548
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,760
 whatever could go it it like it's but it'll be your towel rail or something yeah well like it

549
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,200
 might have been the bin oh yeah bins i'll get you the bin might have been too big but yeah like

550
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:29,360
 but it was fine i wore my mask um i walked didn't didn't use public transport um so yeah it was fine

551
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:36,000
 i am not sympathetic um oh and i'm taking part in a University of Southampton um

552
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:45,600
 southlinson NHS uh covid 19 testing pilot program where i spit in a small vial and they tell me if

553
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,200
 i have coronavirus they don't tell me if i have had coronavirus they tell me if i currently have

554
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,600
 coronavirus and i think this is part of them trying to get set up for city-wide testing and

555
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,320
 kind of instantaneous timescales or as near as you can get when you're doing this kind of thing

556
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,840
 so yeah i'm helping yeah we cannot tell you if you have had coronavirus from your saliva we need

557
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,520
 your blood for that john so so we can actually so i can't do blood tests at home i pass out so

558
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,200
 spit test is good enough then because an awful lot of people have been stuffing things up their noses

559
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,440
 and and it seems like if a spit test was adequate for this wouldn't they just be spitting so there

560
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:32,560
 are various papers comparing the utility of uh an asiparangial swab to saliva and saliva does

561
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,240
 seem to come out quite well but i think there's some slightly contradictory results and the other

562
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,040
 problem is that i think trying to get people to swap their own noses and throat successfully at home

563
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,960
 is quite difficult because really needs a swab you know that you need to like swab your tonsils without

564
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,960
 like touching the rest of your mouth which is quite complicated and possibly just spitting in a tube

565
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,520
 is better i can spit in a tube successfully but i cannot do any of the other things and i got i

566
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,520
 got a blood test at home once and it was like prick your prick your thumb and put blood in the thing

567
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,040
 and i have a phobia blood but i was like i could just prick my thumb i can't i can't as it turns out

568
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,840
 much easier to get the trained with different city to have the blood test that is to do at home

569
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:16,480
 for john i'll just come around with like a diamond pen and write blue on it for you john and i will

570
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,040
 charge you only 20 quid i didn't say like in what time slot i would come and visit you john yeah in

571
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:31,040
 fact john if if i promise to do that will you quarantine me for 14 days in your house oh hello

572
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:38,960
 hello uh why is she unhappy
