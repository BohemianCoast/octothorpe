1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
 I'm really sorry this is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:18,920
 Hello everyone and welcome to the unlucky 13th episode of the

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,200
 author podcast, a podcast for science fiction and science

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,680
 fiction fandom. I'm John Coxon.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,000
 I'm Alison Scott.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,080
 And I'm Liz Betty.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,240
 This is the episode for the third of September 2020.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,800
 Maybe this will be our final episode.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,520
 Why will it be our final episode?

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,200
 It's unlucky 13th. You just said.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,920
 Well, yeah, but I still want to keep going.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,480
 Yeah, quite enjoying it.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,320
 I'm worried now.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,320
 I'm not saying that I'm just saying you just said it was a lucky

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,520
 maybe you'll be unlucky.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,640
 I'm being a political podcast.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,720
 Why you follow up from Liz?

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,400
 She's breaking up with us on the podcast.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,360
 You heard it here first.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,360
 Oh, we have letters of comment from two usual

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,680
 commenters and one unusual commenter.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,280
 And I knew the first one is Mark Plummer, who notes that Alison

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,400
 described Robert Silverberg as the only person left who has attended every

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,480
 Worldcon. Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,560
 He knows that she probably means every Hugo presentation unless he went to the

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,280
 first Worldcon when he was in like when he was four.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,480
 But Mark expresses doubt.

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,520
 Yeah, no, I'm just talking bollocks there.

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,200
 Sorry, we knew what you meant.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,640
 So we didn't even question it.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,400
 That is true.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
 We should have stepped in a bit like Alison, but then Mark wouldn't have

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
 written to us and that would have been a dream.

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,360
 So, you know,

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,480
 or we could fact check the podcast.

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
 That's not ever going to happen.

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,400
 We rely on our listeners for that.

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,160
 Yes, we have fact checkers.

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,320
 This is the fact check in.

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:50,960
 Claire Breiley of Croydon writes in to comment on our podcast.

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,680
 She writes lots of lovely things.

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,120
 She notes the same comment about Robert Silverberg, but she also says that

43
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,840
 Mark's mentioned that to us already.

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,480
 Or no, she says, I bet Mark's mentioned that to you already and she was right.

45
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,800
 So you win the bet, Claire.

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,880
 We owe you a pint.

47
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,440
 It was a very, very good luck.

48
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,120
 And we very much enjoyed it.

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,960
 So thank you very much for that.

50
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,200
 And then Ian Sorenson writes Hello, PODIFILES.

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,120
 He notes that his concern with the Saudi Arabian bid for Worldcon was that if

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
 they had been nefarious, they could have bought a few thousand Worldcon

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,720
 memberships and just won.

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
 And that is a good point that I hadn't thought of and is an interesting thing

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,080
 to kind of contemplate.

56
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,360
 I don't think there's a really good way of avoiding that ever happening.

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,320
 Because yeah, I'm going to say that that's a kind of, oh, but any bit could

58
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,480
 see, or any bit could actually do it.

59
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,360
 The it's it's when people say, well, any bid from a new country.

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,040
 Obviously, that could be its government planning to move in and do that.

61
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,840
 And you say that about Saudi Arabia and you say it about China, but you do not

62
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,960
 say it about New Zealand or Finland.

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,640
 I think you have to take a little step back and go, what what is going on when

64
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,480
 I say this?

65
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,480
 Because it's it's not entirely a justifiable point with China.

66
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,360
 There's a real risk of that because we know that the Chinese government is

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,880
 funneling money into the Chinese bidding process.

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,480
 Or we see we assume that it is because there's kind of because the Chinese bid

69
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,080
 gets, I'm doing square quotes here, sponsorship in a way that you would not

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,600
 normally expect a bid to get.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,240
 But I don't think you can say that about Saudi Arabia and I don't think it

72
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,560
 has ever been any suggestion.

73
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,440
 I suspect that if the Saudi Arabian government were familiar with the work

74
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,960
 of the people who are putting on the Saudi Arabian bid, they would not only not

75
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,240
 want to win the Worldcon for Saudi Arabia.

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,920
 They would prefer it didn't happen at all.

77
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,760
 We say that the Chinese government are sponsoring or funding money into Chinese

78
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,520
 bid, but so far they've mostly funneled the money in by helping them have more

79
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,280
 people at a big convention they ran.

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,760
 Whereas I think using lots of money to essentially pay people to be supporting

81
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,080
 members of the Worldcon and pay the voting fees.

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,240
 I think it's a different use of your money really.

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,720
 Yes, I should say we've seen no sign of that from China.

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,600
 No, and I think if you're the government, you say, well, why don't we just, you

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,520
 know, help you hold this convention rather than, you know, essentially send a

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,760
 bunch of money in to fix you getting it.

87
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,040
 But for China, I can see that one way it might happen in a way that the Chinese

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,040
 government and the Chinese think is perfectly reasonable is for the Chinese

89
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,480
 government to say, oh, all of you people who are going to start switching

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,680
 conventions in China anyway, we will help you get involved in this

91
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,400
 international thing by paying for your membership in, is supporting membership

92
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,320
 in the bidding convention.

93
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,760
 And also he says that he has sent Lillian and Christina instructions on how

94
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,680
 to start editing a podcast, which is excellent because he says that the

95
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,680
 online tutorials he's done with them will either go on the podcast or in a

96
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,680
 video compilation on YouTube. And can I just say in that when that happens,

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,160
 I will be enthusiastically watching because that sounds amazing.

98
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,800
 I have not tried to get Alice in all this to edit the podcast because I

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
 quite quite like edited the podcast.

100
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,080
 So it's all right.

101
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,160
 I do think this was hilarious.

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,800
 I thought that this podcast was made up of two people who very much wanted to be

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,040
 on a podcast that somebody else said it's on one person who very much wants to

104
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,000
 edit a podcast.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
 And I'm assuming that most podcasts are like that.

106
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,520
 Yes.

107
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,960
 And I was quite surprised to hear that Ian was actually trying to pass the

108
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,480
 editing duties off to one of the others.

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,480
 Listen to this never happens, which has now had four, four episodes, and which

110
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,760
 talks about all sorts of things that are not science fiction or fandom.

111
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,240
 It talks about everything.

112
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:07,480
 In the last week, the news came out that Chadrick Boseman had died of cancer.

113
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,600
 This is incredibly sad. People listening to this podcast might know him best for

114
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,720
 his work as a T'Challa or Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

115
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,960
 And obviously this is a huge shock because I think we've all gotten used to

116
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,520
 the horrible headlines around COVID-19 and coronavirus and kind of a lot of

117
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,440
 illness and death.

118
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,000
 But Boseman died of cancer and he's very young.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,400
 So this is a great shame.

120
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,200
 43, I was very sad to hear of Chadrick Boseman's death.

121
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,440
 I thought I was a great shame, etc.

122
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,200
 He's very, he was a very good actor.

123
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,520
 Did you see there was a link going round of him?

124
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,720
 They got people who thought they were talking to a Black Panther poster and he

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,480
 was hiding behind a curtain and would pop out and surprise them.

126
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
 And it's brilliant.

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,320
 That is, that is quite excellent, isn't it?

128
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,360
 Because there's lots of people and they're, I think they thought they were

129
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,000
 going to be on, they thought they were going to be on something.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,200
 So it's like, basically, you talk to these big Black Panther posts and, you know,

131
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,120
 tell us what you really feel.

132
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,120
 And they're all so, it's all Black people and they're all so sort of excited and

133
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,560
 they're so grateful to him and things like that.

134
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,320
 And there's, but there's one guy who says things like, you know, I've seen it twice.

135
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,840
 It's cinema.

136
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,760
 And then once I bootleg and then like Chadrick Boseman pops out, I was like,

137
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,080
 you bootleg my film and the guy's like, no.

138
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,440
 That is excellent.

139
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,440
 But he comes out and says the guy's name, you know, and the guy's name was

140
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,040
 obviously like quite a long complicated one.

141
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,520
 And the guy's just like, he's like, and you said my name right.

142
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,760
 So I thought it was quite, yeah.

143
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,480
 Just watch the video because it was so, and it's so lovely.

144
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,720
 And it's someone who went to same college as him saying, you know, how

145
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,080
 lovely it is to see that representation on the big screen.

146
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,160
 And then of course, like he pops out and it's like super charming and super cool.

147
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,960
 And they're all like, God's mad.

148
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,640
 It's amazing.

149
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,160
 So I watched Black Panther last night.

150
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,440
 It's trending on Apple TV because everyone is doing that.

151
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,680
 I said to Mariano, I guess a lot of white folks who haven't quite got

152
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,080
 round to Black Panther are going to watch it this weekend.

153
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,960
 Yeah, that's a good point as well.

154
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,440
 I hadn't thought of that, but yes.

155
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,520
 And that was me.

156
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
 I was that person.

157
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,680
 It's quite a good film.

158
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,200
 Yeah.

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,280
 I mean, I should say that I was not watching.

160
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,600
 I was not watching Black Panther from the point of view.

161
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,320
 I was watching it and looking at it as am I enjoying this?

162
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,000
 Movie do I think it is a good movie?

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,520
 Is it the sort of movie I like to see all of that?

164
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:41,480
 Taken as look how much money they spent on a film where almost every

165
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,800
 major character is black.

166
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,680
 It's an absolute masterpiece.

167
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,920
 I've been kind of going, Oh, I wish they were making more use of Black Panther

168
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,360
 because he's a really good character.

169
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,680
 And I'm not sure why he's not getting more time in Marvel movies.

170
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,640
 I think I now know the answer to that question.

171
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,920
 And Marianne was like, who is the next Black Panther going to be?

172
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,800
 Because it could be it could be his his sister or his son that we don't know

173
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,920
 about yet or his girlfriend or or a random Black boy from America.

174
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,720
 I think it will be it would be cool if they did.

175
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,680
 Sure.

176
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,000
 But obviously because she has like her own, I'm not sure if she's ever been the

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,560
 Black Panther.

178
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
 She might well have been.

179
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,440
 But like I think of her more as like she is so much better suited in that kind

180
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,560
 of being the amazing scientist role that making her into the Black Panther

181
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,480
 seems like it would almost be a demotion.

182
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,680
 Cue the code name for that role is cue.

183
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,080
 I understand that Shuri in the comics has been Black Panther, but it's kind of

184
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,840
 instead of that she'd always wanted to be Black Panther.

185
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,880
 Please comics more avid comics, please, please write it and correct me if any of

186
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,800
 that is wrong.

187
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,280
 And so I could see her taking up the back panther mantle.

188
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,800
 And I think it's it would be interesting to see someone who is more sort of

189
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,200
 technology focused really take that on.

190
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,240
 I guess maybe they're shying away from that a little bit because it's a bit

191
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,200
 similar to say Iron Man and you know, using a lot of technology.

192
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,760
 But I think it could be really good.

193
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,520
 I agree that I don't think they're going to want, you know, they're not going to

194
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,560
 want to recast Black Panther.

195
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,400
 They're never going to recast a chalice.

196
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,880
 So I am confident that if Ryan Coogler continues to make Black Panther

197
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,880
 two that he will come up with a really good way of handling it.

198
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,960
 I hope that they'll get to do it is Winston Duke, the guy who played Dominic

199
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
 in person of interest.

200
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,600
 He was the co lead in us.

201
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
 Oh, you think that they'll recast the same character?

202
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,120
 No, no, I don't.

203
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,280
 Oh, Winston Duke was already in, right?

204
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:48,320
 Yeah, he played Baku, the chief that doesn't take part in Woodcander and

205
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,880
 to Charla brings him into the fold. I think he would make a great Black Panther

206
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,840
 because I think he's a great actor.

207
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,640
 He's his profile has been rising.

208
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,400
 He was in us.

209
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,480
 He's been a person of interest.

210
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,080
 He's been in a few other things as well.

211
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,640
 He did have the funniest line in that film also.

212
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,000
 And yeah, and I just think he would be a really great choice.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,040
 So if they're not going to make it shurry, then I think he would be a good pick.

214
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,440
 He's not done much movie work, but he's great.

215
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,720
 Is he in the bloodline?

216
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,680
 You don't have to be.

217
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,160
 That's not how a condom politics works.

218
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,960
 OK.

219
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,680
 But you probably do have to challenge, but you probably could challenge.

220
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,280
 So that's and that will kind of fit in quite well, depending on how good they are

221
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,640
 with like, they're going to have to.

222
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,600
 I don't know what happens in work, under if I see this is in the comic somewhere,

223
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,040
 but I don't know what happens if the King dies before someone can challenge for the throne.

224
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,920
 The Jabara. Is it Jabara?

225
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,480
 I'm sorry.

226
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,680
 I'm not really up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

227
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,640
 It should probably get the name right.

228
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,440
 I think they are the Jabari Jabari.

229
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,840
 One wrinkle with that is that he and Baku in the comics is the villain,

230
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:55,680
 Manape, who is like, obviously a baddie, whether or not the Marvel Cinematic Universe

231
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,360
 will go with a black supervillain called Manape, given that that seems like an obviously

232
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,480
 terrible name for a supervillain who is black.

233
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,600
 I suspect means that he's not going to do that with that character either way.

234
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,080
 So I think he would be a good choice, but we will see.

235
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,880
 He certainly to me, he's to me, he seems like the best choice.

236
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,160
 I hope they could with him because I'm a huge fan of his work.

237
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,520
 I think the fact that they actually played, they played with the fact in the film,

238
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,520
 that comic book viewers or readers will have known that that was the character.

239
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,640
 So they played quite hard with the, is this a villain or not in the film?

240
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,600
 So they've already, they've already gone there.

241
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,960
 They've made it clear he's not a villain.

242
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,760
 I think so.

243
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,560
 This is a spoiler for Black Panther, so here's a spoiler warning.

244
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,240
 There is a point in the movie where these guys turn up, having previously said

245
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,080
 they're not going to it.

246
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,160
 It's like bloody Gandalf riding down on Shadow Fact.

247
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,560
 Hey, that's a spoiler for Lord of the Rings, Alison.

248
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,160
 It is also a spoiler for Lord of the Rings, but tough.

249
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,680
 Well, she didn't say what Shadow Facts was.

250
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,480
 Shadow Facts could be like a tank.

251
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,320
 Yeah, or a giant armor plated rhino.

252
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
 I did like the giant armor plated rhinos.

253
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,160
 I did like the giant armor plated rhinos.

254
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,600
 Yeah, in the, it's in the positive qualities of Black Panther.

255
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,200
 The fact that I enjoyed it, that it used a lot of African cultural stuff in a way

256
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,800
 that was actually not crappy.

257
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,640
 And in the list of things I did not really like about it were the fact that

258
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,440
 enormous amounts of it appeared to be cliches bolted on from other bits of other

259
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,960
 movies. And I suppose that is normal and, and the general level of comprehension

260
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,240
 required to understand the movie was consistent with a movie where you had

261
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,080
 Lillian sitting next to you talking all the way through it, which I, I kind of, I

262
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,120
 kind of missed Lillian.

263
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,520
 I would really have liked to have Lillian sitting on myself for drinking red wine

264
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,520
 for, for yesterday evening, for that movie and talking all the way through the film,

265
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,440
 which is what she does.

266
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,000
 You froze for like 30 seconds and then I just got a Lillian drinking red wine on

267
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 myself.

268
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,520
 So I do what you said.

269
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,880
 Oh, and also I, I watched a fascinating video on, I don't know how much was this

270
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,120
 we're going to use on movie music, which is, okay, there's a very good video on

271
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,440
 the internet about why a lot of the music in the Marvel Cinematic Universe

272
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,200
 and other modern movies is bad.

273
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,680
 And it's because they basically send the composer a kind of George Lucas

274
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,920
 like made up list of things that they think are the sort of thing they would

275
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,240
 like the music to sound like.

276
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,680
 And then the composer goes and writes music that sounds a bit like that.

277
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,040
 Right. Well, one of the, one of the things that they have used for the score of

278
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,440
 Black Panther is the opening music for the Lion King.

279
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,120
 And that was a really, really, really bad choice.

280
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,480
 So there's this side, oh, and, and Marianne's like singing along with Disney

281
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,680
 movies at that point.

282
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,080
 Or you would be Taylor with a Disney movie, you're watching one.

283
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,760
 I understand that.

284
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,240
 And I just say to her then, well, MCU has been bought by Disney, but I'm not sure.

285
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,240
 Was it Disney owner at that point?

286
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,320
 Yeah, Disney owned it well before.

287
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
 Yeah, Disney's owned it for years.

288
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:10,680
 OK, so in general, I guess my, my, my problem with the whole of the MCU and is

289
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,280
 that, and maybe the whole of Disney plus apart from Hamilton is that the entire

290
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,080
 thing appears to be pitched at a reasonably literate 11 year old child.

291
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,280
 And I am not that person.

292
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,560
 No, you're an illiterate 11 year old child.

293
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,480
 Oh, thanks for that.

294
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
 That's all right.

295
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,320
 Someone actually made a really good point, which is Disney is the last entertainment

296
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,480
 company, because all the others are now just the video divisions of mobile phone

297
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,000
 companies or dot com startups.

298
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,200
 And Disney is the last movie studio standing, which is a really, really

299
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,960
 discombobulating statement that doesn't make any sense to start thinking about it.

300
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,880
 You're like, Oh, yeah, because it's Disney, AT&T, Comcast, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple.

301
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,920
 So any time Warner isn't it?

302
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,720
 I don't know.

303
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,240
 Maybe I don't time Warner's owned by AT&T.

304
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,720
 Yeah.

305
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,040
 OK.

306
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,440
 No, they're they're all they're all they're all either dot com startups, the video

307
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,600
 divisions of mobile phone companies or Disney.

308
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,760
 Those are the options.

309
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,360
 It's weird.

310
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,160
 I'm feeling better about my Disney plus subscription, because I the only reason we

311
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,280
 were watching Black Panther in the first place support independent artists by

312
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,800
 Disney by Disney by Disney.

313
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,400
 Also, Disney acquired Marvel 11 years ago, 11 years ago tomorrow, in fact.

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,040
 I feel like it may have become more like a Disney company more recently.

315
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,800
 Disney acquired Marvel like before they even released the Fenders

316
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,360
 assemble.

317
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,440
 So I guess the sort of second and third phases of the Marvel universe have been

318
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,680
 completely well, they've been a Disney owned subsidiary.

319
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
 I guess.

320
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,080
 Yeah, it should be pivot to being a Marvel podcast because we probably get a lot

321
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
 more viewers that way.

322
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,000
 We're getting any viewers for a podcast listeners.

323
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,560
 Should we pivot to being a Marvel podcast?

324
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,760
 Because we probably get a lot more listeners that way.

325
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,000
 No, because every time you say that every every time you give your opinions on

326
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,680
 Marvel movies, we will lose listeners.

327
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,280
 So this is a net drop in listeners almost certainly.

328
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,240
 So you think that people who like Marvel podcasts think that Marvel movies are

329
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,920
 clever and more?

330
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,160
 Yeah, they probably do think they're clever than they are.

331
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,040
 Yeah.

332
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,600
 I think I think you said they were aimed at mostly literate 11 year old.

333
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,800
 And I suspect the people who are listening to Marvel podcasts would object to that

334
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,640
 characterization of themselves.

335
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,400
 Possibly.

336
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,200
 It's like there's a chance.

337
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,560
 They are kind of towards the lower end of the middle brow.

338
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,080
 That I think you think that's you being tactful, which I very much enjoy.

339
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,560
 But they really they just they're very, very easy to consume, aren't they?

340
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,280
 Well, I mean, I think that's probably true.

341
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,680
 But I'm not sure.

342
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,080
 It doesn't make them bad.

343
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:05,720
 Last weekend, as we record was NASFIC, the North American Science Fiction Convention.

344
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,880
 NASFIC has held in years where the world can't be held in America.

345
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,960
 And obviously this year, the WorldCon was held on the internet.

346
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,760
 So therefore, a NASFIC had to be held.

347
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,720
 It was held in Columbus, Ohio, except it wasn't.

348
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,120
 It was also held on the internet because of just as our window.

349
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,160
 Liz and Alison spent some time at NASFIC.

350
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,320
 What would your experiences like Liz and Alison?

351
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,640
 I have to start with a kind of contractual statement, which I will say every time

352
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,720
 the NASFIC is mentioned, that the provision for NASFIC is contained in the World

353
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,960
 Science Fiction Society's constitution.

354
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,800
 And it definitely shouldn't be.

355
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:47,560
 And this wines, Europe fans who are not from North America up quite immeasurably,

356
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,040
 but nevertheless, it never goes away.

357
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,760
 So there is always a NASFIC, but only in years, there is a dewilcon.

358
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,840
 And it's slightly strange convention for that reason, normally, because it

359
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,080
 normally comprises those fans who are rich enough to go to both the WorldCon

360
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:12,640
 and NASFIC, and those fans who cannot possibly attend a European or Australian

361
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,760
 worldcon, but would quite like to go to a national convention anyway.

362
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,000
 And so therefore, I've never been to a NASFIC before, but I

363
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,840
 got invited to sign up for programming for this one.

364
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,720
 So I did do and they put me on some program.

365
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,400
 All of my program was on Friday and I did that and then I hung out with people

366
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,320
 and I made some arrangements to work on the Glasgow desk.

367
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,360
 And then I actually had actual life things on the Saturday and the Sunday when I

368
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,720
 went out and met real people in the real world, you know, like we used to do.

369
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,280
 So I ended up not spending anything like as much time at the NASFIC as I might

370
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,160
 otherwise have done. But I did sit on the Glasgow desk, which was a lot of fun,

371
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,600
 support Glasgow in 2024. If you haven't supported it yet, it's very easy to do so

372
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,240
 at their website, a link to which will be in the show notes.

373
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,600
 And the program items I was on, which were about doing fanac in the age of

374
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:14,800
 COVID and trying to sell things at online events were quite interesting and I

375
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,400
 enjoyed them a lot, but I didn't get a lot of the program otherwise.

376
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,120
 And I feel that this is one of the things that's now happening with online

377
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,160
 conventions, which is that the real world is more exciting a lot of the time.

378
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
 So yeah, this was the first virtual convention.

379
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,640
 I've actually been too largely because it was free so I could just pop it out.

380
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,960
 So I did join the discord and had fun poking around a bit on the discord.

381
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,040
 I went to two panels because the problem is that Columbus, Ohio is 11 hours behind.

382
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,320
 I would say that it took me quite a lot of digging to figure that out because

383
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,800
 the front page of the NASFIC website does not at any point tell you it's time

384
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,200
 zone or even tell you that it's the Columbus in Ohio.

385
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,960
 So I will reiterate my plea for every convention to either put the like times

386
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,440
 in UTC or at least tell me the time zone.

387
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,480
 But I managed to figure this out.

388
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,760
 And so I could basically go to maybe two program items because they were the ones

389
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,800
 that were held while I was awake.

390
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,200
 So I went to the item that was Farmendelson and Alec Navalle talking about

391
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,120
 researching Golden Age science fiction in the present day.

392
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,920
 I really wanted to go to that.

393
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,560
 Moderated by Nicholas White and it was great.

394
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,720
 It was one where it was exactly the right, it was exactly the right set of people

395
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,520
 with a very good moderator and the two of them probably could have talked for

396
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,920
 at least two hours and I would not have been bored.

397
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,760
 And I found it really interesting and you can go back and watch that.

398
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,880
 I also went to a panel on Afrofuturism, which was straight after that with a

399
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,080
 large number of people on and that was good, but it worked a little less well,

400
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,800
 partly because one of the participants was having internet issues and sort of

401
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,720
 dropped in and out.

402
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,120
 And secondly, because it was a larger panel and I think it is much harder to

403
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,640
 moderate a panel of four or five people on Zoom because a lot of the things you

404
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,360
 might do just don't really come across.

405
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,600
 Like I think if you're sitting in the same room as people, you can kind of try

406
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,360
 and encourage them to maybe wrap up and we'll move on to the next person if someone

407
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,720
 is, you know, basically every time they respond to a question, they have a lot to

408
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,000
 say, you can sort of try and push that along, I think more gently or maybe break

409
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,040
 in at a point where there's a break.

410
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,080
 But I feel on Zoom people, because of there's a time delay and because you're

411
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,680
 not in the same room, you have to basically let everything play out.

412
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:38,400
 And so that was a little detrimental because it felt like some people didn't

413
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,800
 quite get to say quite as much as other people on the panel.

414
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,480
 But actually everyone on the panel, what they were saying was really interesting.

415
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,960
 So maybe the solution is that it should have been a 90 minute panel with more

416
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,480
 room for these things, two more room for discussion to happen.

417
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,400
 And I also did find the fact that there were sort of 50 minute panels with then

418
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
 10 minutes to sort of change over.

419
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,360
 I think you could have pushed that a little bit because there's no reason it

420
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,760
 couldn't be 55 minutes.

421
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,880
 I don't think you need the massive 10 minute gap.

422
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,320
 You could get away with just a five minute quick break.

423
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,440
 I'm going to I'm going to slightly disagree with that in that.

424
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,720
 I think that the 10 minute break is very nice because and this is going to be very

425
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,600
 base, but if one needs a poo, one needs 10 minutes.

426
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
 And the number of professional meetings I've had where it's a five minute break

427
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,640
 and it just be the entire day I don't have room to do certain biological things

428
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,800
 I would quite like to be able to do.

429
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,760
 I'm going to progressively pissed off for people who are like five minutes

430
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,280
 will be fine. No, no, 10 minutes is good.

431
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,400
 I don't need I don't need 10 minutes every time.

432
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,440
 But the time I do need the 10 minutes, I really need the 10 minutes.

433
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,560
 So yes, sorry to our listeners who may not want to know these things.

434
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,040
 I'm going to disagree with this from the other point of view, which is that I was

435
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,440
 Zoom host for a few things at Conzeland and the amount of the amount of hardness

436
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
 it is to change a room over in five minutes is very great.

437
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,240
 Now, in fact, this got that's like actually had two was running two rooms in parallel.

438
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
 So I don't think anyone actually had to do that.

439
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,760
 But if you are having to change over a Zoom room in five minutes, it's it's

440
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,480
 impossible and people might have been programmed sequentially, which and 10 minutes

441
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,000
 is not really enough time for panelists to to get sorted for another item.

442
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 So so I think 10 minutes is fine.

443
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 So I will I will push back that if you're paneling, you probably should not be putting

444
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,320
 people on back to back panels anyway, because whether you give them a 10 minute break

445
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,800
 or not, it is hard work.

446
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,960
 They did have two different rooms they could be using.

447
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,560
 And it just felt like we were cutting off at, you know, 10 50 when they hadn't

448
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,440
 really had much time in those 50 minutes to expound on it.

449
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,760
 Once we actually get the hang of how to get people to buy from dealers at an online

450
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,920
 event, which, you know, they would like to do dealers have things that the members

451
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,840
 would have not seen before and would really like to own.

452
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,000
 And the members are inclined to buy things from dealers.

453
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,680
 But the process of putting them together is completely failing at the moment in a way

454
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,600
 that's making everybody very sad.

455
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,720
 And if we had a 10 minute break, I think one of the things we could be doing with the

456
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,760
 10 minute break is here's here's the sponsored deal.

457
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,040
 Here's the feature dealer for this 10 minute break.

458
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,080
 Go and see that stuff.

459
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,440
 I mean, the other thing about dealers rooms is even if you showed me a bunch of stuff

460
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,240
 in that 10 minute gap, I likely wouldn't buy it.

461
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,080
 And the reason I likely I'm not buying anything from dealers is unless it is like

462
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,040
 ebooks or something, I'm not buying anything because I don't know when it will arrive

463
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,720
 at my house.

464
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,040
 So, you know, electronic dealers rooms fundamentally for me are a thing that doesn't

465
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,880
 work because I have no idea how long the post is currently taking to get to me.

466
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,480
 But it could be, I think it's probably months.

467
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,640
 So overall online sales remains strong.

468
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,720
 One of the things that was really interesting about this at the UK Games Expo is a lot

469
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
 of dealers had a lot of trouble.

470
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,840
 Like the number of people that they expected to get through was was vastly

471
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,040
 lower and the problem with dealers of the internet.

472
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,280
 And I think I think Alison is slightly wrong here is that I impulse by stuff in

473
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,280
 person that I would not impulse by at home.

474
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,720
 And I think the context of a convention where you get to go on holiday, I buy things

475
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,240
 on holiday that I would never ever buy when I was not on holiday.

476
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,120
 Conventions are very much an example of that mindset.

477
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,800
 And this UK Games Expo, I didn't spend anything.

478
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,160
 My usual budget for UK Games Expo is around 200 pounds.

479
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,560
 So like the disparity there between like my usual behaviour and my own

480
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,920
 line behaviour is vast.

481
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,240
 And I can imagine for a lot of other people is too.

482
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,000
 So I think dealers are a really difficult thing.

483
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,680
 But I think a lot of that is psychological and I'm not sure to what extent

484
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,600
 it's because we don't have the platforms versus other considerations.

485
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,400
 Sorry, Alison, tell me why I'm wrong.

486
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,840
 I feel that this is it's like parties.

487
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,120
 It's one of the things where you could either ring your hands or you could look

488
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
 at what will help worked out with that.

489
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,280
 Yes, fair enough.

490
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,640
 And I feel because it's kind of a third way of selling.

491
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,720
 So you've got people who they've been saying, oh, it's been really difficult

492
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,320
 for people who are used to selling face to face to move online.

493
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,200
 And all the dealers are like, no, we do have established online shops because

494
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,720
 we're not actually dealing from the past year.

495
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,040
 It's not about physical sales or online sales and online sales remains strong.

496
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,800
 There's no in general people are still buying things online.

497
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,120
 It's actually trying to find whether it is possible to create a market

498
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,240
 for selling at these online events and in particular for finding a way to highlight

499
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,400
 the fact that you can get unique things from dealers in our field that you cannot

500
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,480
 that you will probably not find just by browsing the internet because because

501
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,200
 they are marketing that they can market directly to you.

502
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,080
 Now it won't work for dealers who are selling things that are easily available

503
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,120
 from from other large companies, but lots of dealers are selling unique things.

504
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,760
 And I feel like those dealers ought to be able to do.

505
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
 We ought to be able to find a way to make that work.

506
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,240
 Anyway, and if we can't, I will just walk away.

507
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,560
 I've I've said I'm not ever I'm not paying any more money for a dealer's table.

508
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,560
 It's an online event until until this is cracked.

509
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,480
 You know, I feel that that although I did not lose money at

510
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,720
 Consilent, the money I spent for a dealer's table, there was largely waste.

511
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,160
 Dealers, it sounds a little bit similar to something that Bristol Con

512
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,000
 does or at least used to when I went to a couple, which is between

513
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,400
 panels, they would have like a very short five to 10 minute reading slot,

514
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,120
 usually for an up and coming author to come and read their work out.

515
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,320
 And it didn't really work for me because I'm distracted by moving rooms

516
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,600
 and working out where I put my phone and getting myself set for the next panel.

517
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,400
 So I'm not listening to this poor person reading at the front of the room.

518
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,440
 So I worry if you use that 10 minutes to kind of advertise dealer stuff,

519
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,160
 you would see like the number of people in the zoom, just like ticking slowly

520
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,360
 downwards that could be quite demoralizing.

521
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,920
 But I don't I don't have a good solution to the online dealers room thing.

522
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,640
 The point I was trying to make is that I think that is a really difficult

523
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,960
 problem and I don't I also don't have any good ideas about how to solve it.

524
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,680
 I think is I think you're right.

525
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,920
 I think people are not in really the right places to be spending the sort of money

526
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,400
 that they might spend in a dealers room if they're at an in person

527
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,480
 convention right now as well.

528
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:18,120
 When I think I will actually say I tell a lie slightly because I did buy some swag.

529
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,920
 Um, from both the UK Games Expo and from FarcomCon, which was a, so the UK, sorry,

530
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,680
 I should have said this.

531
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,840
 The UK Games Expo was a convention held at the same time as NASFIC, which I spent my time at.

532
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,120
 The one thing I bought at the UK Games Expo was a Games Expo 2020 dice bag.

533
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,240
 And the one thing I bought at FarcomCon was a set of alt-art cards for

534
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,360
 Akmara and the thing they both had in common was that there was a time limited

535
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,880
 aspect to the purchase.

536
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,240
 Um, the alt-art cards had a discount for the duration of the convention and the

537
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,800
 dice pouch was only available to buy that weekend.

538
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,720
 And so I didn't think, oh, I can just put this off for a month and it will be fine.

539
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,520
 I'll book out the page and then never buy it.

540
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,720
 Why did I bought it then?

541
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,320
 Because there was a reason to buy it then.

542
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,520
 And I think the way that you capture the impulse purchase thing is you have like,

543
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,960
 all my stuff is 20% off if you use this convention specific code that is valid until

544
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,480
 Monday. And I think that might help.

545
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,240
 But obviously, my great revelation here is that making things cheaper makes things

546
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,600
 people more likely to buy them.

547
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,240
 And I'm sure that most traders have already thought of that.

548
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,120
 Um, it does, but you can put your prices up by 20% and they give people a 20% discount code.

549
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,240
 It works just as well.

550
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,560
 But Alison, that would be dishonest.

551
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,040
 You'd think, wouldn't you?

552
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,960
 Um, so in Britain, there's some trading laws that don't that limit the extent to

553
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,880
 which you could do this, but when you're trading globally, those really don't apply.

554
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,720
 And I think the trading standards would have very great difficulty in enforcing them on

555
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,720
 you, but often when you see things being sold at a discount, you should just assume,

556
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,120
 just assume that the price of being charged is the actual price for that item.

557
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,600
 And it is not in fact a discount.

558
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,640
 You do have to put it back up to the regular cost afterwards.

559
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,840
 Otherwise, people will notice and get abandoned with you.

560
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,600
 You could have time limited ones.

561
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,840
 But limited edition things just for an event are good.

562
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,200
 And I might use them in the future.

563
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,720
 Time limited stuff seems like a good, a good idea, something you can only buy that weekend.

564
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:28,120
 And hopefully in price ranges where people do think, Oh, and impulse, I can impulse buy it this weekend.

565
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:34,080
 Um, the other thing I wanted to say about this was because they're five hours behind parties

566
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,200
 were at an inconvenient time and they had two lots of parties.

567
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,640
 They had one using a scheme called Gather Town, which is a large space in which people can move,

568
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,280
 little avatars of people can move around.

569
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,560
 And then when you get into groups close to people, it's set, it spits up a zoom-like window

570
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,800
 with their video faces.

571
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,520
 And this actually worked OK.

572
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,360
 It felt very bitter, but it felt like an I've used similar systems in the past as test.

573
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,200
 It worked look like something that could be made to work with a bit of, with a bit of work.

574
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,280
 Um, it had it suffered one attendee was letting their child run all around the space.

575
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,080
 And so that child kept kind of their video would appear for about three seconds

576
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,360
 through your through your party as they were laughing and joking.

577
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:30,040
 And that really accurately recreated the experience of having an eight year old running

578
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,480
 around a bar to me.

579
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,080
 And while I didn't enjoy it, I thought, Oh, well, maybe we're getting somewhere with this

580
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,800
 replicating the feeling of being in a bar.

581
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,480
 So I quite liked it.

582
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,120
 The actual video as ever is not as good as zoom.

583
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,800
 If zoom put a layer like that on top of the zoom function we've already got.

584
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:53,640
 So in the corner, you would see the local area of your bar and a list of all the people

585
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,720
 and you can see a list of all the people in the bar generally.

586
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,280
 I think that would be pretty killer.

587
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,840
 The other night's parties were on zoom, but because I'd actually been at a real party

588
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:11,240
 in the real world with real people that day, I was not capable of attending a party at

589
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,640
 what started at midnight, my time, by which time I was fast asleep.

590
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,840
 So that was a normal zoom party of the sort that we've been doing.

591
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,520
 And I think that was also pretty successful.

592
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,560
 Again, I would like more parties at different times of the day, please.

593
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,640
 I will say I didn't go to I didn't go to NASVIC.

594
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,040
 And I in general, like with reconvene, which was the weekend before NASVIC, I think.

595
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
 I think that's right.

596
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:43,440
 I paid my $10 and I actually didn't really feel like I got $10 worth of enjoyment out of the convention.

597
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,440
 I think the thing I am learning in lockdown is that conventions for me are very much

598
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,440
 social spaces and not spaces to receive information.

599
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,920
 I go to the panels because I enjoy them, but if it was just panels with no social space,

600
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,440
 I would not go to conventions.

601
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,120
 And I think what I'm learning is the online conventions, which are basically just panels

602
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,800
 with no social space are very much not a value proposition for me, which is not a criticism of them.

603
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,560
 Because I appreciate there is an audience for that.

604
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,400
 But certainly it is not, it is not my cup of tea.

605
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,840
 I will say as ever that I want more conventions to do more thinking about the virtual

606
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,560
 social space and make it better.

607
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,320
 The panels are quite useful so that you have something to talk about in the social spaces.

608
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,280
 Something else we should probably say about NASVIC is that they tried a new method

609
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,280
 of showing panels to people, which is that they only put the panel participants into the zoom

610
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:45,600
 and they put every and then they used Vimeo, I think, to display to everyone the panel

611
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,080
 and the Discord chat in a kind of single window.

612
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,400
 And this had the effect of making the panel very, very small for a lot of people.

613
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,240
 I don't know whether the person who came up with that idea was doing it on a 27 inch monitor.

614
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,840
 But they were wrong and this was a mistake.

615
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,680
 I mean, they've embedded in their website a thing that let you have the Vimeo and the Discord side by side.

616
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,600
 But you could just have the Vimeo as a stream.

617
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,960
 And in fact, I did it by eventually working out how to cast it to my TV.

618
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,840
 So there's nothing saying you had to only view it on their site.

619
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,600
 It worked perfectly fine. Oh, yeah.

620
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,040
 I mean, it took a bit of budging because I couldn't get out of my Chromecast very well.

621
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,760
 But once I've got it sorted, I did.

622
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,960
 So I basically do this as, oh, well, I'm going to watch panels instead of TV for a couple of hours this evening.

623
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,560
 And I didn't really engage with the Discord at the same time.

624
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,840
 But there were people asking questions to the Discord.

625
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:39,280
 Yes, that now we had two, I did two panels and in one of them.

626
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,880
 So they said to us both tips for being a good online panelist and tips for being a good online panel moderator.

627
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,720
 And I didn't moderate a panel at this one.

628
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,960
 But one of the panel moderators was a very good panel moderator.

629
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,960
 They were using the Zoom chat, which is because only the panelists are in Zoom.

630
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,440
 It's only for the panelists.

631
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:10,000
 They were using that to queue up the next topic of conversation and tell people to wrap up and invite people, say,

632
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,360
 I'm going to ask you to talk about X.

633
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,760
 So you can have a little bit of time to think about it.

634
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,000
 And she was also very good at like bringing people in to the conversation

635
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,680
 and just the way a good moderator should.

636
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,480
 And the other moderator was appalling.

637
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,120
 And I'm kind of like, why are people like this?

638
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,920
 And they weren't a bad person or or or or or in your

639
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:40,600
 anything. They just didn't do any of the things that you want a moderator to do at all.

640
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:48,600
 So they weren't really directing the flow of conversation or bringing people in or asking them about particular topics.

641
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:55,360
 And I've I've kind of lost my, you know, they start, you know, you're in trouble because you get to the panel early.

642
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,760
 And I say, well, what are your plans for the panel?

643
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,920
 A moderator, they're kind of like, Oh, I just thought I see where the conversation went.

644
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,720
 Boo.

645
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,840
 And I'm kind of done with this at this point.

646
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:15,120
 I was on a panel at Dublin and the moderator the day before the convention started had not sent a message saying is the flow of conversation.

647
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
 So I did.

648
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,400
 I sent the message saying, I think the flow of conversation should be this.

649
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,000
 I don't know whether the moderator will agree, but here is my initial pitch.

650
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,320
 And then the moderator had to come up with a flow of conversation because otherwise it would be by default.

651
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,960
 But when I had decided on, and I felt very passive, aggressive for doing it that way.

652
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:40,760
 But I was like, I, I am as I get older, progressively less willing to put up with moderators who don't put any effort into their panels,

653
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,800
 especially when I put effort into moderating my panels.

654
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,680
 And so I'm quite happy to be like, well, as a panelist, here is the list of things I will ask my fellow panelists about.

655
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,680
 And if you don't want that to be the conversation, you need to go up with a better one.

656
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,760
 Because this is now my de facto plan.

657
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,640
 I am perfectly happy for the moderator to do all that work,

658
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,240
 that the work that the moderator has to do for the to prepare for a panel.

659
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,600
 I am perfectly happy for them to do all that work in the 10 minutes before the panel in the green room.

660
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,040
 This isn't going to cover the surprise to either of you guys, though I do actually manage to email round people.

661
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,800
 I'm not that bad. But, um, but the kind of, oh, I'm just happy to let things drift,

662
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,760
 especially in an online con where we know now that letting things drift really does not work in a really big way.

663
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,000
 You know, it is just not good enough.

664
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Yep. I mean, speaking as someone who edits a podcast, I can confirm that that is true.

665
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,600
 So I will, I will, I will very quickly run through my experiences of UK Games Expo.

666
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,120
 Firstly, Liz was there, which was delightful.

667
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,600
 And I believe Alison was on the UK Games Expo Discord as well.

668
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,480
 I couldn't get there. Couldn't get there too much on last weekend.

669
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,040
 I got a lot of badges.

670
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,720
 Part of the other shameful admission is the part of the reason I bought merch is because you had achievement badges on your profile through the weekend.

671
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,720
 And there was a achievement badge for buying someone a virtual beer,

672
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,720
 an achievement badge for buying someone a virtual hot dog, an achievement badge for donating to the UK Games Expo,

673
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,240
 and an achievement badge for buying merch.

674
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,280
 And I have all four of those achievement badges, which is about 20 credit.

675
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,960
 I wouldn't have spent if they didn't have achievements.

676
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,440
 So like, that's another way.

677
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,440
 Game of fire and they game of fighting good.

678
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,880
 I saw that the list of because I got despite the fact that I didn't do a lot in UK Games Expo,

679
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,440
 I got some badges and I was like, oh, achievements.

680
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,960
 I like achievements. I am, I am a monkey.

681
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,200
 You can make me happy with gold stars.

682
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,480
 And I went to the list of achievements and I saw that by something from a dealer

683
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,240
 achievement, I was like, yeah, I didn't write it down anywhere.

684
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,480
 But if you're organizing online, like on ribbons, virtual ribbons,

685
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,800
 don't do it as virtual achievements.

686
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,840
 Do it as virtual ribbons because that's more famish.

687
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
 Virtual ribbons and have.

688
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:59,560
 I bought something from the dealer's room and I bought something from the art show as virtual ribbons.

689
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,360
 Yeah.

690
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,080
 How did they implement them?

691
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,080
 Because Nastvik had virtual ribbons, but you just clicked on a little emoji on a chat window.

692
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,560
 So no, so in the UK Games Expo to get an achievement,

693
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,040
 there was achievement for going to each of the key sponsors stands,

694
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,840
 which were pages in the dealers hall, which was only accessible if you'd registered.

695
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,640
 And if you went to them, you unlocked the badge for going to that stand.

696
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:31,080
 And then each exhibitor exhibitors were given links that once you'd done a demo

697
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,640
 with them or interacted with them, meaningfully, they could send you a unique link

698
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,200
 and you clicked the link and it awarded you that badge.

699
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,080
 So like if you took demos for games, you couldn't just farm a bunch of links cheekily.

700
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,120
 You had to actually do demos and it worked.

701
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,760
 It was very good.

702
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,600
 I have no idea what level of technical

703
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,080
 investment was required to settle this up, but it was great.

704
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:03,000
 I think lower than the amount of technical investment than Conzil and put into its 3D dealers hall.

705
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,720
 You know, I think.

706
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,840
 Oh, yeah, 100%.

707
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,320
 It's not that much. What they did was every member of the convention.

708
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,280
 And I think this is something that every online pay con should do.

709
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,600
 This is a really good idea.

710
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,480
 Had essentially a profile page that people could visit.

711
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
 And we could do that for any con.

712
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,800
 And then when you met somebody, you could go and see their profile page and people could

713
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,800
 I don't think they could at UK Games Expo, but you could have people personalise

714
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,360
 that with their picture of their bio, just as if they were program participants,

715
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,160
 but for everyone.

716
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,400
 And then the achievements were all that could all be there.

717
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,240
 You know, this feels like very basic web design to me that I could do.

718
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,040
 I would have to spend a long time on it and I would cry and curse a lot,

719
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,840
 but I could implement this thing.

720
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,360
 And I should say I could not implement a 3D dealer hall no way.

721
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:59,160
 So I think I think in general, the personalisation, the limit of the personalisation

722
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:05,200
 of the UK Games Expo was basically like you can you can set people a list of the badges

723
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,080
 you've got, but like there is no reason you couldn't have had it be like a customisation,

724
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,400
 a customisable page I suspect.

725
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,000
 And that could have worked really well.

726
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,240
 I think that would be lovely.

727
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,880
 And I think it would be really nice to because you do meet people in passing

728
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,680
 at these online cons and I mean, you do in real life as well, but you it's hard

729
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,080
 to get a sense of what they're like.

730
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,200
 I'd have liked to do it for my fellow panelists as well.

731
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,720
 I'd like more information about the people I was on panels with,

732
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,000
 both before and after I was on the panels with them.

733
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,120
 That was indeed the 13th episode of the Octa Thought Podcast.

734
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,480
 So for now, it is goodbye from me.

735
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,120
 It is goodbye from me.

736
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,520
 And it's goodbye from me.

737
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,960
 The theme music for this episode was fanfare for space by Kevin MacLeod

 [Music]

740
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,040
 Hello, sorry I was in a totally different zoom link.

741
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,560
 Yeah.

742
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,560
 You were right. John was John as one because

743
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,280
 he had patriarchy.

744
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,160
 What? It's an outrage.

745
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,520
 I clicked the link.

746
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,840
 I have a link favourite, which says "Allison Zoom" and I clicked that link.

747
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,400
 And now I am with Allison and Liz.

748
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,840
 I failed to see how I've done anything wrong.

749
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,560
 OK, because that's the morning coffee zoom and a lot of people have that link.

750
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,240
 So theoretically, we could get zoom bombed on it.

751
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,000
 So I'd run these zooms off my personal zoom meeting link, but obviously there is no

752
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,320
 actual risk here, really.

753
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,640
 Someone who knows you from Coffee Morning joins in the podcast and then we have to

754
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,760
 kick them out. It doesn't seem like a lot of risk.

755
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,720
 That would actually probably be quite fun.

756
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,960
 An improvement on the podcast.

757
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,320
 Never tell Lillian that this is how she becomes a guest.

758
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,400
 Yeah, never tell Lillian we're doing it.

759
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,680
 [beep]

760
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,280
 Do we have to bleep swears?

761
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,120
 Yeah, we do.

762
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,480
 If you are an explicit tagged podcast and someone has parental controls turned on,

763
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,400
 their children cannot listen to any podcast that is listed as explicit.

764
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,640
 Just so you can say, "Beep."

765
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,600
 I mean, can they voluntarily block us?

766
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,640
 Can parents decide, "No, I don't want my children listening to those reprobates

767
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,160
 on the Octa though podcast," and like, "Preemptively block it?"

768
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,720
 Obviously, this is a huge issue.

769
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,200
 I think I should mention here that this is all that's based on a US

770
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,240
 understanding of what is meant by a swear word.

771
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,360
 Yeah, because we all know that if I call Alison a f*ck, that's just that's just that's

772
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,680
 just pub talk, you know, that's not explicit.

773
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,240
 It's just nice. That's gonna get go out.

774
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,000
 Yeah, you can, but just bleep the swear words entirely so I have no idea what you

775
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,240
 called Alison.

776
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,120
 That's rare.

777
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,320
 That's great, actually.

778
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:03,400
 What if I say that John is an absolute, oh, let me think of a good.

779
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,680
 Oh, no.

780
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,200
 Yeah, if I say that John is an absolute muppet who talks nothing but bollocks,

781
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,080
 none of that is going to be, is going to trouble the Americans in any sort of way,

782
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,480
 because it's not part of the set of words that they consider rude.

783
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,240
 Anyway, I'm not sure whether the Americans consider a f*ck rude.

784
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,680
 They don't consider f*ck rude.

785
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,800
 They don't consider bollocks rude in particular.

786
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,720
 They don't consider bollocks rude at all.

787
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,000
 They don't really understand that the British think the bollocks is quite a rude word.

788
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,720
 Yeah, well, it's bollocks in it.

789
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,000
 Well, it's Americans and it's bollocks.

790
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,360
 Um, don't write it.

791
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:44,360
 We were presumably going to a podcast and not just say British swear words.

792
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,720
 I'd rather talk about swear words for 45 minutes than the the the retro hugos.

793
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,320
 But I suppose this is.

794
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,400
 Yeah, so let me get the show notes.
