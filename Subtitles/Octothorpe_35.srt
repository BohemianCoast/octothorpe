00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 The podcast of science fiction, science fiction, fandom and cake etymology.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,840
 I am glad that we said we'd speak a bit less about cake this episode. That's going well so far.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,840
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 35th episode of Octa Thorpe which is coming to you on the 8th

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,680
 of July 2021. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty.

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,520
 And we are recording early this week because it's coming home. It's coming home listeners.

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,680
 It's coming home and by it I of course mean Liz. Yes, the reason we are recording early is because

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,480
 it's coming home. Fingers crossed, you know, don't want to jump the gun. But should I test

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,360
 negative for coronavirus on Saturday on Sunday I will get on a plane and come to the UK.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,160
 And how long are you going to be in the UK? I don't know. I haven't put the return flight yet.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,560
 Probably mid-August. That's crazy. I didn't realise you'd not put the return flight yet. That is a level

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,080
 of free-wheeling spontaneity I have never achieved in my life. So I'm slightly in awe.

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,200
 Yeah, I don't think I've ever managed to not book one leg of the transportation.

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,920
 I mean, you know, obviously there could be like a day or two between all the bookings getting

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,200
 sorted because it's such a pain but no more than that. I don't feel comfortable about holidays

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
 until I know how I'm getting through place to place for the whole time.

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,120
 And to be fair, often if you don't have a passport for the country you're going to,

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,280
 the people at the border don't feel good about your holiday if you don't have the return

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,040
 leg book time. Yes, this is only possible. This is only possible because the UK are basically

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
 obliged to let me in and they're not allowed to tell me a date I have to leave again,

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,600
 which is not true of any other country in the world. Take that, pretty. It's coming home and

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,720
 there's nothing you can do about it. Please, please don't do anything about it if you can.

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,120
 Don't. Is it too late to give me COVID? So I test positive? It probably isn't. So yeah,

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,360
 don't do anything, listeners. There are boring technical reasons why I've only booked one way,

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,840
 which we do not need to expand on in the podcast. We have some letters of comments.

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,440
 So Chris Garcia sends a lock which contains 100% cheese and cake related content.

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,400
 And he's right. A bit like our convention, really. A bit like last week's podcast, really.

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,800
 Yes, yes indeed. Yes, I think we should apologise to anyone whose first episode of Octa thought

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,960
 was last week and alike. What are these people on because they have just whitted about

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,960
 cheese and parties for an entire hour? And we would like to apologise to anyone who is coming

30
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,160
 to this episode as their second episode and has the opinion that it is not nearly enough about

31
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:17,200
 cheese and cake. Both opinions are entirely valid. Yeah, now I read Chris Garcia's

32
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,600
 comment which said 100% cheese and cake related. And it said Trevat shows us the best of all cakes

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,400
 trailing only red velvet and carrot cake. And the thing that struck me about this is that I like

34
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,000
 cake very much except for red velvet cake and carrot cake. So I'm worried now.

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,800
 Oh, I forgot that you don't like carrot cake. I feel like I have a spectrum of cake and I really

36
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:51,040
 don't like those cake. I mean, I much prefer my perfect cake is maybe a brownie or a lemon drizzle

37
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,400
 cake. I'm kind of into the solid Scottish cakes with not too much frippery type cake.

38
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,120
 I'm about to get us some letters of comment. So just regard the mastery with which I do this.

39
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,480
 But I think you'll find brownies are not cakes. So, you know, well, that's a load of bollocks for

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,360
 a start off. You can't disagree with me too much on the podcast, Alison, because then people won't

41
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,200
 write in. What makes you think the brownies are not cakes, John? If they were cakes, they would be

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,120
 called brownie cakes or, you know, chocolate cakes or something ending in cake. Because it is my

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,920
 observation that things that are cake have the word cake in them. Okay, so no, right. No, you know,

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,640
 as this hill, there are many hills I'll die on. And this is indeed one of them. I'm like,

45
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,960
 I'm like the Rome of podcast hosts. Jesus, you do understand. So you'll probably say that a pie is

46
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,960
 a pie if it had pie in the name, rather than or at a tart if it has tart in the name, rather than

47
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,440
 pies being pies and tarts being fundamentally determined by the amount of pastry coverage.

48
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,960
 I will say bloody love me some carrot cake cream cheese topping. Mm-hmm. No, no, no, no.

49
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,000
 And I don't put beetroot in brownies either before you ask. I think Alison, Alison, I think

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,560
 is on record as being anti-vegetables in cake. Exactly. That is, if I had to nail you to a personal

51
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,080
 philosophy, that would be it. What I'm going to say is that I have a long history and fandom already

52
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,640
 of having discussions about the classification of baked goods. And I'm going to shy away from

53
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:38,160
 starting any completely new ones. But I will say, what about, say, uh, Madalins? They're cakes,

54
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,360
 right? But they're not called a Madeline cake. But that's because they're French, they're gato.

55
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,360
 She's called that an exception. She's called you that. What about banana bread?

56
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,680
 Yeah, banana breads are cake. There we go. And in fact, all of those breads like Dayton

57
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,480
 Walnut loaf, they're all cakes along with brownies. But banana bread isn't a cake, it's one of your

58
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:05,360
 five a day. Different. That's not true. Okay, that is true, but totally if you eat like half the loaf,

59
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,320
 at which point you have other problems, it's not five a day related. Swiss roll. Far. Swiss roll.

60
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,400
 That's a very complicated sandwich. Or alternatively, it's a cake. All right, all right. Right, onwards,

61
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,600
 onwards. Spike has sent us an email with a poem in it from a poem a day service she subscribes to.

62
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,520
 And I have found the poem on the internet. So I will put a link in the show notes. And it is entitled

63
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:40,480
 Commerce by Miller Oberman. So it is very related to our recent convention. Thank you very much to

64
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:48,880
 Spike. Faram Mendelsohn tweeted to show a picture of Freddie, which is far as cat listening to the

65
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,600
 podcast with Farra at the live recording at punctuation two. So if you like pictures of people's cats,

66
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,560
 why will put the link to that tweet in the show notes? And Peter Sullivan emailed during the live

67
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,560
 recording as well, I think, or perhaps the day after saying that there is a US diplomacy games

68
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,560
 convention called the Boston massacre, which is going online this year and is going to have rounds

69
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,960
 at eight AM, four PM and midnight UTC. And if you play in all three, only your best two scores count.

70
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,840
 So that is another way of doing international things, which is basically force everyone to stay up

71
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,480
 for 24 hours. And then no one can sleep. And that just seems like a wizard scheme. So yes.

72
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:44,400
 Nesumdorma. Wait. Nesumdorma. Bless you. And then hello Brian tweeted as to say also why the bleeps.

73
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,600
 What is this the **** bbc? It is not the bbc, although you know, if the culture minister wants

74
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:58,320
 to give us any money because we're a public benefit, we're always in. I also do a mean line in PPE,

75
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,760
 but I understand that gravy train has come to an end lately. Don't worry, there'll be more gravy

76
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,000
 trains, but you're not a mate of anyone relevant. So not for you.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,280
 Why? Some of my friends are very relevant. I'll have you know. And finally we had another email

78
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,360
 from Fran Dowd, who wrote us a lot about PIMs. She is researching the history and perception of the

79
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,160
 PIMs brand and recipes and her conviction that you should add more gin appears to be a modernish

80
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,960
 blip that came and went. I would argue it hasn't gone Fran as long as you and I sustain it. I always

81
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,600
 add gin to my PIMs because well it's just better that way. I highly recommend anyone try it. And she

82
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,800
 also says that she's going to be experimenting with making her own PIMs, but she doesn't mention

83
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,840
 anything about Hooker's nor Blackjack. We had one final comment from Graham Slite who said that he

84
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,520
 was awaiting eagerly the tell me what to think about Discon and the Hugo's Octa Thorpe. And that

85
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,720
 is what we call listeners a segue. Now I'm a member of staff for Discon 3.

86
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:12,160
 I am a member of staff for Discon 3 and Discon 3 haven't told me anything about what I should or

87
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,120
 should not say about this because Discon 3 do not have a clear promotional voice that they insist

88
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,960
 all of their staff adhere to. On the other hand Glasgow in 2024 set out some very clear rules.

89
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,920
 Oh wait you've got some clear promotion so wait Glasgow have some clear promoter rules

90
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,560
 about what you were allowed to say about Discon. Yeah yeah yeah. Interesting I mean it made sense

91
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,720
 makes a lot of sense. Yeah they basically said do try not to spout off the mouth about this.

92
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,680
 I mean I'm slightly paraphrasing the comments. Did they email it just to you personally?

93
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,640
 So Meg if you're listening I'm very sorry I do not speak officially for Glasgow in 2024 which I

94
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,000
 think everyone knows at this point. Yes. Liz would you like to explain about Discon and the Hugo?

95
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,600
 Okay I'm going to suggest to anyone who wants to know further details of what I'm about to

96
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,800
 summarise. Read Jason Sanford's genre grapevine primer which he wrote on the 25th of June and

97
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,640
 there's also a follow-up post. But essentially the Hugo administrators which is Discon's second

98
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,280
 set of Hugo administrators resigned on mass. A little later there was much discussion on the

99
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,400
 internet of the fact that Worldcon had said that they would limit finalists where there were more

100
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:40,320
 than four finalists for a single a single entity to only being allowed for four people and a guest

101
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,520
 in the pre-Hugo reception in the reserved area for the ceremony. They have now changed their mind

102
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,000
 again and will now allow groups nominees to send as many people as they would like.

103
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,960
 And of course this all takes place on a backdrop of you know last year's Hugo ceremony being very

104
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:09,200
 long and mangling lots of people's names and a kind of history of Worldcon's not doing very well

105
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,640
 by large groups of finalists or pronouncing their names. So I recommend that you read those two

106
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:22,080
 posts and all the links that spin off for them if you want to know more. As an even more follow-up to

107
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:30,000
 this the chair of Discon 3 Bill Lohan resigned this week. This was obviously the second Discon 3

108
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 chair to resign after his co-chair already resigned over a previous Hugo finalists discussion.

109
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:46,160
 So yeah it doesn't seem to be going super great for Discon and the Hugo specifically

110
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,320
 but there have been some signs of movement and they have a new head of the Wispers division.

111
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,280
 Linda Dennoroff and there's been some more communication now from Gaddy everyone who is the

112
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,600
 head of events and appears to have taken charge of getting some communication going with the Hugo

113
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,240
 award finalists in order to try and put things straight. So I'm actually one of the very few

114
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,120
 members of the Hugo team that did not resign because my work does not affect the related area

115
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,680
 and because we've almost done we've still got a few little bits and pieces to tidy up but we're

116
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,640
 basically finished so we're carrying on. Wispers division now has a new division head which is

117
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:37,360
 Linda Dennoroff so thanks very much Linda for taking on a poisoned - it's like it's a

118
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,640
 poisoned chalice and you know that the previous two people who picked it up have kind of keeled

119
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,760
 over a bit later go "Ahh I know it really was poisoned"

120
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:55,600
 But no I'm sure it'll be fine now. And our best wishes with Nicholas White's family.

121
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,080
 Nicholas is fine but Nicholas and his team resigned and then the chair resigned so Bill Lauren has

122
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,480
 resigned. So there's a process by which Discon will appoint a new chair. I think Bill sent a

123
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,800
 note round thanking everyone for their work and giving some sort of final thoughts and express

124
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,600
 wishes for what might happen now that he's no longer chair and that included a possible name

125
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,920
 for a chair which seemed pretty sensible name to me but I think it is in the hands of

126
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:35,280
 whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you could do with the sound of that

127
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:43,200
 as well done i think i've got one uh please. i have no idea what's going on right now

128
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:52,080
 i think it's the hah. oh you've been sent from bone okay you think central bone is the official

129
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,240
 the name of the um parent organization is boston washington association for willcon

130
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:06,800
 administration oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa oh i see okay so it is what what what what it kind of

131
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,880
 works quite well i mean it's a good acronym turn out ten to have a came up with it i like a lot

132
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,960
 mainly because it is a little bit silly in a way that i enjoy whoa whoa whoa but i don't really

133
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,280
 know anymore than than has been publicly stated which is that there was a big route and now they

134
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:29,200
 have reversed their previous position so um i am on uh i am i am a hugo finalist

135
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,520
 and uh so i've been in a couple of days or i've witnessed a couple of discussions i don't want

136
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,880
 to say i've been in them because i don't really feel like i've contributed to any meaningful way

137
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,600
 but i've witnessed a few discussions around this from the finalist's perspective and i know that

138
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:51,520
 there have been discussions between the finalists and the events division at discon which have led to

139
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,040
 some of these things being um kind of rolled back slightly i think a lot of this is coming from the

140
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:06,560
 fact that the finalists are after the big buster when collet fozard resigned um there was quite a

141
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,280
 lot worry around kind of the relationship between discon three and the hugo finalists and that led

142
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:23,680
 i think two strange horizons putting a um 80 person um team in to their um category uh in the awards

143
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,720
 and so i think and you know that they did that in order to try and make a point and to make that

144
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,520
 point forcefully but i think the problem with that is is it did make that point forcefully and i've

145
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,520
 seen a number of people not just on the disc on three side of this saying well that was not a

146
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,480
 particularly diplomatic thing to do and i think part of the problem here is that dc are worried

147
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,600
 that there are finalists acting in bad faith with regards to naming lots of names and the finalists

148
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,560
 are worried that discon three is acting in bad faith because they want to strike back against

149
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,640
 finalists having lots of names and i am worried that but basically at the moment both parties in this

150
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,800
 discussion are coming out this from the perspective that the other party is acting in bad faith and i

151
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,120
 think that is one of the reasons we're seeing this blow up very quickly when there are problems

152
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,480
 um and to be clear i don't think that i don't think the discussion we've had has been a bad thing

153
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:25,280
 but i do wonder whether that has not helped deescalate as it were i think that this assumption that

154
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,320
 people are trying to be difficult or are acting in bad faith or that the reason where that lines

155
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,960
 have to be held is because otherwise everything will come crashing down in a year or two is

156
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,840
 i think because nobody's had a chance to get together in a room this is everybody is very

157
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,400
 touchy people are touchier than you'd expect them to be normally i did talk about this a bit

158
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:56,080
 in michael's bar talk but um i think it's more generally true that you're seeing

159
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,160
 situations that would have been resolved by people hanging out and having a chat just not

160
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,120
 getting resolved and just getting worse and worse over the last 18 months and so probably got a

161
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:17,280
 little bit more to get worse yet because i don't think necessarily the oh yes we will give free

162
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,960
 passes free day passes and to everyone who's listed on a hugo ballot um and we will list everybody

163
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:31,040
 who's involved in the production of a finalist work on the hugo relative they wish is a is a

164
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,640
 permanently sustainable option so eventually that is going to cause problems down the line probably

165
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,680
 but it might not might see because i think there's probably quite a lot of other things going

166
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,320
 on the hugos that involve large teams where the large teams are kind of looking at this and going

167
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,160
 oh maybe we should expose the size of our team a bit as well just want to ask when you say

168
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,480
 because people haven't got together in a room for you who specifically do you mean

169
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:04,160
 like the the discount hugo team or people in general or i think at the moment because of the

170
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,600
 pandemic because we are all uh at the tail end of 18 months of extreme stress and haven't had much

171
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,120
 into personal contact we are all doing badly expressing ourselves to everyone else and so i

172
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,160
 i think um and i think that i've been seeing that work with people being more irritable with each

173
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,560
 other than usual as well um so i i don't think it's just fandom or like discolony is like humanity

174
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:35,840
 as a species well i think we've underestimated the extent to which a business gets done in side

175
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:46,080
 conversations in coffee shops in parties at oh i heard you the you know somebody's talking about

176
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,480
 strange horizons putting 87 people on the ballot can i introduce you to so-and-so who's a member of

177
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,280
 strange horizons editorial collective and then 10 minutes later they're fast friends under at the

178
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,400
 bar you know that sort of thing doesn't happen doesn't happen very much on zoom so i think to

179
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,560
 push back against that a bit one of the things that have come up in the discussion is strange horizons

180
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,600
 are saying you know they have a very large number of people on the finalists listed as finalists

181
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,520
 but they never expected more than a handful to come to the convention because many of them are not

182
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,440
 regular congoers partly because they're an extremely geographically dispersed team so they're not people

183
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,760
 who are going to be in those conversations anyway um so that may not be like it just feels like we're

184
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,400
 saying explanation is oh well they were not sort of there having these discussions but i guess the

185
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,160
 chances that people would be introduced these people are low if these people are not feeling like

186
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,640
 they can make it to our conventions anyway yeah i think some of those people who were

187
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,040
 speaking for them would have been there as well yes and i mean i think another part of the problem

188
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,640
 is i think people have been speaking sort of four strange horizons or assuming things on behalf

189
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,680
 of strange horizons or suspecting that really any of the issue with the number of fuga finalists

190
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,600
 was caused directly by strange horizons when it doesn't appear to be because they seem to be quite

191
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,160
 happy with only having four people at the actual ceremony because that's about the number they

192
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:15,280
 expect to attend but i would say sorry i think there's actually sort of three sides to it almost

193
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,280
 which is there's a people saying you know if it seems weird to me to list as many people and you

194
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,920
 know you can't expect to get more than you know four into ceremony then there's the people saying

195
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,640
 well we want everyone to be listed we know not everyone will be able to attend or be actually present

196
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,720
 as a finalist but we do definitely want them all to be listed but then you also have a third group

197
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,680
 who seems to be saying very much that if you are a hugo finalist you need to be treated as a hugo

198
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,040
 finalist and that has to encompass everyone which means in a way you kind of have to give all of

199
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:53,200
 those 87 people the same opportunity to be there and be on the stage and you know what if they what

200
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,480
 if more of them did manage to attend then you thought might attend then you necessarily need to treat

201
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,960
 them in in that way and that i think is not something that's trying to try in terms of asking one

202
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,920
 to say it's coming from other groups who feel very strongly that if everyone is a hugo finalist they

203
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:14,320
 have to be treated in in the same way as a hugo finalist so i think almost somewhere at the intersection

204
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,800
 of those three is where we're getting the issues coming up hmm there's definitely also a thread of

205
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:29,040
 and and furthermore the world con doesn't make enough of hugo finalists that the experience of

206
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:36,240
 being a hugo finalist is fundamentally bad and um i've been a hugo finalist quite a lot times and

207
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,240
 i didn't find it so but it also it's fair to say it really only consisted of here's an envelope with

208
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,920
 a ribbon and a pin in it so we'll see you on saturday so i think recently we have seen more

209
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,200
 and more discussion of using hugo finalists more and more in the world con and there's been discussions

210
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,840
 about you know if your program doesn't reflect enough of the finalists um then is that okay i do

211
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:08,640
 wonder whether part of that is a gradual shift or or shift in perception um away from conventions as

212
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,880
 a place where fans talk about their experiences two conventions as a place where you know prose

213
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,160
 talk and fans listen and that's something we've touched on on octa thought before and i don't think

214
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,480
 there's a right answer but i definitely think there are multiple scores of thought and i think

215
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,680
 where you stand on some of this stuff will be very much a function of where you stand on that

216
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:36,960
 question um from my perspective i find value in both i like listening to people who are very good

217
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,920
 at doing things talk about those things that's very interesting but i also like listening to fans

218
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,200
 talking about how they relate to the genre i find that interesting and i i do wonder whether

219
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:55,200
 there has been no room for nuance or for kind of acceptance that there might be um perspectives

220
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,160
 here that are very well intentioned perspectives which are logistically very difficult to accommodate

221
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,000
 i think this is a bit of a red herring argument in some ways in that i think there are very few

222
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,800
 i think there are very few cases of a hugo finalist who is attending world con that you would not want

223
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,040
 to use on program somewhere whether it be a fan attendee or a pro attendee um and i think there's

224
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,680
 very there's very rarely sufficient numbers that there are going to overwhelm you know going to

225
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:30,480
 constitute such a huge amount of program participation that it pushes out other people is my feeling

226
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:38,560
 now again if you did have a an entity which nominated its entire staff and there were significant

227
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,360
 numbers of them and they were going to attend then that might be a problem but at the moment i don't

228
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,400
 think it is a problem because they basically don't you're going to win these don't attend

229
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,560
 insufficient numbers to be really overwhelming the program and many of them will make fairly

230
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,160
 last minute decisions and they're usually very accommodating if you say okay we'll try and

231
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,360
 start you in for something but we can't promise anything uh at this point so at the moment it

232
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,400
 doesn't seem like that is a a really big logistical problem my experience from world con is that

233
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:18,000
 fan programming even extremely good fan programming that's really well thought through

234
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,120
 does not draw the audiences of even minor writers um so you will get a bigger audience for

235
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:34,080
 four writers who are as dull as toast talking when you will for incredibly interesting funny

236
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,920
 fans and um that's i think just the way it is in the demographic we've got now um might less be true

237
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,400
 might be less true in the us um than it is in european world cons my primary experience of

238
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,400
 this in european world cons and when we kind of say oh we're not sure we could put everyone who

239
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,840
 asked on the program i think we probably can almost everyone apart from the people who say oh i can

240
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,280
 only do things you know between the hours of 12 and 2 on thursday and saturday and that's always

241
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,880
 going to be difficult um i was on a program i didn't come to zero and nobody should go back on and

242
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,280
 check with a kind of random fan from the midwest who really didn't have anything interesting to say

243
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,360
 on the topic and i think not just to be somebody who was you know was not like a hugo finalist and

244
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,480
 i kind of take that as my standard for if a world con has room for people like that on the program

245
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,440
 or people like me it's definitely got room for the hugo finalists all of them every single one as

246
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,200
 long as they get their programming form in yeah pretty early yeah i think i think that's probably

247
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,280
 true i mean i know but i do wonder whether so for example one of the big controversies about

248
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,160
 conzeland and is that the program didn't have enough content from the finalists and mary robinette

249
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:55,120
 coel was parachuted in with like two weeks to go this was san hosey it wasn't it what was it san

250
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,880
 hosey i think it's san hosey she was but conzeland also had the same i mean conzeland did have some

251
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,400
 of the same issues so i think so i think just to be precise i think which is that i think conzeland

252
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,840
 specifically had a problem with the hugo finalists i'm pulled in some help but it was san hosey which

253
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,680
 had a problem in general i think i'm pulled in mary robinette coel to help successive world con

254
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:26,720
 programming teams have struggled to make the diversity of the program reflect the diversity

255
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:33,120
 of the genre and participants and in particular hugo finalists and there's more that we can do here

256
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,960
 and some will cons are better than others yeah i think it's definitely fair to say that we are saying

257
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,120
 that you know we we don't think it is usually a problem to accommodate hugo finalists on

258
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,040
 welcome programs there have definitely been examples where it has not happened in the way you would

259
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:53,360
 want it to happen and of course from the outside the difference between like if it is actually

260
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,640
 difficult to accommodate someone and you haven't really made an effort to do it look pretty similar

261
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,040
 so there's two things here so one is that normally when i've been involved with program what happens

262
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,640
 is at some point you go to the hugo team and say can you tell me like who's attending and then we

263
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,720
 can cross check them on our list of program and if they are attending and we don't have the

264
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,320
 damn program you know can you send them an email asking them to get in touch with us

265
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,600
 but the other thing is there is a kind of distinction here in that sometimes for pros it's very easy

266
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,800
 to add say a reading or a signing or a cafe clatch at the very last minute that gives them a way to

267
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,320
 meet their fans the way to participate in the program that can be quite difficult for like

268
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,080
 fan category no one is because usually you want to put them on a panel or you want to say give

269
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,600
 them an item or you know about you know a live recording of their fan cast or something like that

270
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,000
 and there was a much more difficult to sort of wedge in at the last minute it's much easier to

271
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,800
 say okay i've got a spare reading slot here are four slots can you do any of them fine we've got you in

272
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,960
 but i think the other thing here is obviously that you know world cons need to be doing their part

273
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,480
 to make sure that their programs do reflect the diversity of the genre and if that is through

274
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,800
 making sure that you go finalists you you might not have usually put on program get on program

275
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,760
 then that is a very good way of doing that but also kind of from the the general membership like

276
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:27,280
 i think you know we went through this and i think to a large extent have now been through this with

277
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,520
 with with making sure that panels reflect gender diversity and it's about time we start working on

278
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,600
 the other aspects that we can work on and you know i appreciate that's hard i think hopefully we start

279
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:49,040
 to see younger people in the community step up to that kind of role in order to wield their ability

280
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,640
 to re-examine some of the assumptions in this field in order to bring those more diverse programs and

281
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,920
 i'm hoping that that will happen and that's one of the things i was impressed by when when this was

282
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,680
 deputy dh in london three was that the pool of people working on that program i think was a much

283
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,400
 more diverse pool of people than you could have brought on and that's you know one of the things

284
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,080
 that you can do is make sure that you've got a diverse group of areaheads who are presumably

285
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,240
 going to be better identifying diverse people to speak and that's something i think Glasgow is

286
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,520
 trying to do i mean obviously gazco don't have their programming team together yet but they're

287
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,320
 clearly trying to bring people into their organization who are not necessarily the usual

288
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,320
 suspects and i think that that can only work to help world cons become more diverse and more

289
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,000
 reflective of the diversity of the genre which i think is great um so uh yeah hurrah for that

290
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 there may also be a need for world cons to think about what a world con program looks like

291
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,280
 from the from the ground up because i think it's easier for a new convention to come in and say

292
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,480
 well we want we want to have a diverse program and we're going to do it by getting getting these

293
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,120
 voices in from all of these different places if if world cons start from the point of view of

294
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,160
 we know what a world con program basically looks like and we can obviously change it up a bit each

295
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:17,120
 year it's much harder to get to the end point of a of a modern program i think but they do get to

296
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,320
 try again every year it's true just one last question before we move on to other topics um

297
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,240
 do we think that this is something that's easier or harder for world con as an organization that

298
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,280
 doesn't have that or doesn't have as much institutional memory because it feels like it should be easier

299
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:41,120
 but the fact that both san jose and conziland had difficulties with this might put the light of

300
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,880
 that assumption will cons are not as different as you think they are particularly us ones as yes

301
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,800
 i think the question of world con institution memory could probably take us long as just

302
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,880
 seeing how we would do a world con program from the ground up oh i just want to say one other one

303
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,440
 last thing about disc on three which is they cannot get a break they are having an incredibly

304
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,960
 hard time i do feel very sorry for them yeah bless them i mean a lot of it or maybe not a lot of it

305
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,120
 but there's quite a lot of it there's own goals but it doesn't make it less painful to watch

306
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,080
 yeah we didn't even talk at all i mean i feel like we may have underdone it by not talking

307
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,800
 all about how rubbish their communication was did we talk about how rubbish their communication

308
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,360
 was the hugo finalist maybe we're out of time we probably did a bit oh yeah no we probably should

309
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:36,080
 talk about that disc on three's communication two finalists was um somewhat deficient um i think a

310
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,000
 lot of finalists only found out that there was this limit when it was announced uh and although i think

311
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,240
 disc on three talked about a consultation and none of the finalists felt that they had been

312
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,400
 consulted in advance of the announcement being made and i think some genuine consultation

313
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,560
 would have helped now i'm going to say something which might be slightly um off topic um but i do

314
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:07,040
 wonder to what extent this is because the job of organizing the hugo ceremony falls under a

315
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,560
 different division to the job of organizing the hugos and i have always wondered why the hugo

316
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,680
 ceremony is under events and the hugos are under wasphus that i i think the hugos are a big enough

317
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:23,840
 temple of a world con but they probably deserve their own division um and that would be something

318
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,320
 i wonder whether that would make the communications a little bit more joined up and maybe help avoid

319
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,320
 this in future but maybe i'm maybe i'm incorrect there i don't know um but does anyone have any

320
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,960
 thoughts on on how disc on three communicated with the finalists um and how that went well i mean i

321
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,200
 don't get the finest communications but uh it seems like you know judging by their action many of them

322
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,800
 did not feel that they were you know being honored as a hugo finalist but you know seems like treated

323
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,120
 as like something of an inconvenience because there's too many of them to fit in the room

324
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,640
 um which is not a good look um and as for communications i can see the argument for a hugo

325
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,080
 division but i there's also a lot of places where divisions in wollcons have to interact and maybe

326
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,920
 don't do a great job of doing it um and lots of areas you can improve that i think we shouldn't

327
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,400
 merge events at wisface well we know we could have merged events in wisface it just be really weird

328
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:24,800
 fundamentally events is about how you put a big thing on a stage and every day of the convention

329
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,320
 yeah and there's there's too much similar i think there's too much between like the few

330
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,920
 girls in masquerade to split them into any distinct chunks without then basically doing the same thing

331
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:40,720
 twice yeah divisions have to work divisions have to work together effectively and boards have to

332
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:48,160
 work together effectively and and clearly discom did have some issues may still have some issues on

333
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,280
 that front um i didn't see i was obviously not a finalist this year and i did see some

334
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:01,520
 some stuff coming that i was copied into that i had to say i didn't think that was perfect so yeah so

335
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:08,160
 if you've got the two divisions and they don't really get the chance to um sit down and work through

336
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,000
 the issues properly and then get it to if it needs to go to the chair or to the board for a decision

337
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,160
 get that happening at early enough stage that's when the sorts of problems that arise here in

338
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:26,320
 retrospect at the point where collet resigned and they issued a note saying we will work individual

339
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,040
 we were finalists on things around the ceremony and attending the convention and so on that at that

340
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
 point they should immediately install to the process of making that happen and that clearly

341
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,320
 didn't quite happen in the way that they'd planned probably because they were busy fighting other

342
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,840
 fires around the hotel going bankrupt you know and and that sort of thing you can see how that

343
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,120
 would cause the problems with the hugos to kind of get pushed down the road until the point where

344
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:01,600
 they then blew up and i don't think discom's problems are entirely confined to the hugos i think

345
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,560
 what we're seeing is we had a convention that had a problem overall with its divisions pulling

346
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,200
 together and the hugos was it has been the touch paper for it um if you had a hugos division you've

347
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,720
 put the rest of wasphus into it because the rest of wasphus is relatively tiny so it would just be

348
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,280
 the wasphus division plus half of events but i do wonder whether if this had been under nicholas

349
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,720
 this would not have happened and so if it was up to me i would say the hugo administrator

350
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,160
 administrates all of the things to do with the hugos especially at times when they have come in to

351
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,800
 fix problems with your communications about the hugos but maybe so i take your point i just wonder

352
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,400
 whether the hugos are high profile enough that it might be wise not to introduce potential points

353
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,640
 of miscommunication within your own organization around them um but i don't know at some point you

354
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,840
 have to have a consistent view of what the convention believes and what its policies on things are

355
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,440
 that there's a there was a problem with the division heads and the board actually communicating

356
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,880
 any useful way and i don't know where that problem rests obviously what i said about having a hugo

357
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,200
 division rather than different divisions each of which in direct with the hugos does presuppose

358
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,400
 that the problems that discom three had came from disparities and miscommunications between

359
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:31,360
 divisions and not from the chair the chair has resigned and they are currently looking to put

360
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,640
 a new chair in this is the second well so collet fosard resigned and she was the co-chair of

361
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,920
 discom three and now boulogon has resigned and and he was the the remaining co-chair who had become

362
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,960
 there for the chair of discom three um and so like i suppose the other argument is if these

363
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,040
 decisions were taken at the very highest point restructuring the divisions wouldn't have helped

364
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,200
 and then that explains why um boul has has resigned because this is presumably a fundamental

365
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,840
 difference of opinion between um the hugo team and the chair rather than the hugo team and other parts

366
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:09,120
 of the discom structure and there's no way for us to know um but the fact that the chair has resigned

367
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,600
 might be suggestive or why not in that regard i think the fact that the chair has resigned and

368
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,680
 the policy has been reversed might be yes uh we stress dear listeners that this is speculation

369
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,120
 if your head of hugos goes to the chair and to the board and said well you can hold this line as

370
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,200
 long as you want but it's not sustainable and when it gets out into the public it's all going to fall

371
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:39,440
 apart the director of communication should be there saying either no my view is it's manageable and

372
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,160
 this is the line that we will take on it and this is how we will hold it or they say no i'm with the

373
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,400
 i'm with the head of the hugo division here or the withers with division here and it's not sustainable

374
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:59,360
 now i would say that that's why you have you know why head of communications is a board level role

375
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:05,120
 on the worldcon because you are going to have um things that come up that are going to require

376
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:11,360
 the entire board to speak coherently with one voice on a line that the members of the convention

377
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,680
 will tolerate and i don't think they'd i don't think they'd be doing that i think don't think

378
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,480
 discana's done that very well at all well they don't have one they don't have a communication

379
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,920
 director and that gets back to why i've asked easter con to merge basically merge

380
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,920
 parations and communications because i agree with you there needs to be a consistent line of

381
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,800
 communication but i don't think any fanish convention actually does that because they don't

382
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,560
 have communication they have outreach and i would argue the outreach division is not i mean i think

383
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,200
 probably it is doing a lot of the communications the role of a communications division but like

384
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,280
 it's not geared towards that it's geared towards advertising effectively and so i and then you've

385
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,600
 got publications which are the other half of the voice of the convention and you probably need to

386
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,280
 merge those two into a communications division that does what you just said because i completely

387
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,760
 agree someone needs to be on the board doing that generally speaking it's the chair so if you look

388
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,320
 at dublin for example the voice of dublin was james bakins voice i think we are so far off topic

389
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,360
 this is actually a different discussion especially there was a job supposed about the

390
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:20,960
 vote like what is the voice of a convention and conventions with individual voices that might

391
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,200
 be interesting for a future podcast do you want to kind of draw this to a general conclusion oh a

392
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,920
 general conclusion of discana yeah i've got no idea how to do that no i'm either yeah it's got virtual

393
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,400
 memberships and they're seventy five dollars which is an absolute steal because you'll be paying

394
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,960
 fifty dollars for the hugo packet anyway which is an absolute steal so an extra twenty five dollars

395
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,320
 for hanging out with fans online for five days in the week before christmas when you won't be

396
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,680
 busy at all does seem like i mean twenty five dollars is nothing it was seventeen pounds i mean

397
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,160
 if i go into town and go for curry and have some beers it's going to cost me more than seventeen

398
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,240
 pounds i mean i i feel like this is this is now so cheap as to be a no-brainer everyone should

399
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,800
 join discol three and have a big faddish party and they will definitely be excellent social

400
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,360
 spaces otherwise i'll kill somebody no um sorry on the topic of virtually attending world cons there

401
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:27,520
 is a post on dreamwith from and k grey who says that she is looking for people or suggestions uh

402
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,880
 people to join the working group to address the question of remote attendance and or

403
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:40,480
 participation in the wussford's business meeting and suggestions for the same so if anyone is

404
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,240
 interested in being on that working group or suggesting things for that working group uh then

405
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,000
 please do uh get in touch we've put a link to that post in the show notes uh but i'm sure if you

406
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,040
 can't work out again in touch with an if you don't want to comment on her dreamwith post then we

407
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:04,480
 can put you in touch as well and was the taf administrator when i won taf and she is a good egg

408
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,600
 and it's good to know that they're working on it she is but why would you ask people to do that

409
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:17,440
 in a dream-ruth post rather than say on joff or file 770 or something like that see also problems

410
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:24,320
 with communications uh at world cons no but i mean i i had not seen this and as someone with i think

411
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:30,320
 quite defined views on this uh i'm glad that liz spotted it um liz how did you find it i got it off

412
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:44,320
 twitter last weekend we went to conspire where allison was the guest of honor it was one of the

413
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:51,520
 guest of honor along with john clute and tardotomson at conspire which was the one day um sites

414
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:59,680
 which i can mention for the bsfa and the science fiction foundation and i did a talk and we're

415
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,840
 going to put a link to the talk in the show notes which is ideal for anyone who quite likes octa

416
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,840
 thought but would like it a lot more if it didn't have john and liz on it yes and for those who have

417
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,760
 not been listening to octa dot vlog conspire was the combined bsfa and science fiction foundation

418
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,720
 agms and had panels alongside and allison ran an afterparty because i texted her and said are you

419
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,160
 running an afterparty and she did and it was great and we all got a bit too drunk had it was very

420
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,680
 interesting because i put put it on not only the places where i would invite friends to my parties

421
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,840
 but i also put it on the bsfa discord and said anyone who fancies an afterparty after conspire

422
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:50,400
 come along so we had a mix of the normal sort of luscious and people who might otherwise have

423
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,440
 thought they were getting serious science fiction talk who would seem to be quite surprised to be

424
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:03,680
 exposed to graham chana kennick farrey saying get off my lawn like a good surprised or a bad

425
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:11,280
 surprised and allison's talk was on the topic of her year in virtual fandom and um was i think

426
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,520
 well received my friends liked it that is true i don't know if anyone who wasn't my friend liked

427
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,960
 it it's now available on the internet so you can laugh at me oh nice well put a link in the show notes

428
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:32,400
 anything else to say on conspire i spent the first half of it panicking about my talk so i hope it was

429
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,000
 good and then i listened to tardis talk which was immediately after a while and he was interviewed

430
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,360
 by caroline mercy and that was pretty interesting that's probably also available online um we will

431
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:50,560
 put a link to the best bsfa discord in the show notes uh where you can go if you'd like to see

432
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,680
 what people said about conspire while they were there uh and you know chat to the sort of people

433
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,920
 who attended that was the octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

434
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:11,600
 and it's goodbye from me

435
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:31,360
 yeah the day uh i think the day before yesterday as we record possibly yesterday uh it was announced

436
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:37,840
 that there is going to be a second season of good omens gosh wow oh boy oh boy oh boy i would have

437
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:44,400
 been mildly excited about this i think maybe you know plight intrigue to a general feeling of vague

438
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,440
 positivity if it were not for the fact that they have announced that john finamore will be a writer

439
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,880
 on the project my excitement went from vague to specific and intense so i am super excited about

440
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,360
 this because john finamore is a writer of some repute he has made many radio programs which i love

441
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:09,280
 and worked on television programs which i also love and i am hugely excited to see him uh being on

442
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,760
 a science fiction television project uh it's going to be very good or a fantasy television project i

443
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:23,280
 suppose uh delete is applicable depending on your views on genre i feel like having Neil Gaiman

444
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:32,400
 partner with a co-writing partner who is much funnier than he is can only be to the benefit

445
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,400
 of the project because that's obviously how the good omens original good omens worked because

446
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,600
 gaiman has great strengths as a writer but he's not really a humorist um go on i'll just stand

447
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,760
 here while i are in tahr audience right so it tells me i was going to say direct letters of comment

448
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:59,040
 to octa thought cast at gmail.com come on i don't think that i just don't think that's too i mean he's

449
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:06,800
 he's kind of whimsical and has a sense of of the absurd and the the liminal spaces between

450
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,280
 um reality and fantasy and all of that stuff but i don't think he's funny whereas pratchett is one

451
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,680
 of the funniest writers ever to live and as john says john finamore's pretty bloody funny that's

452
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:27,200
 kind of good and and i think the best bits of the previous good omens were the bits that came from

453
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,560
 the original and they were not the bits that that gaiman kind of padded in later because those bits

454
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,800
 were less funny it's very strange to me because i remember getting good omens out of the library

455
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,640
 when i was maybe oh i don't know 12 and i read it and then i closed the book and i went back to

456
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,440
 beginning and i read it again and i've said that on the podcast already but i basically loved it

457
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,200
 and so it's very strange to me to find that they're they're saying they're making even more of a good

458
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:59,440
 omens tv show and i'm not immediately jumping up and down with joy i very much enjoyed the first

459
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,760
 series of good omens but i did think it was a bit too slavishly devoted to the book in that it took

460
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,640
 jokes that work on the page but maybe not on tv and then forced them onto tv like a lot of narration

461
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,360
 a lot of narration and i think there's also a few bits of the book that maybe haven't age well or

462
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:23,440
 don't work um so well on maybe don't work so well it's on tv because you know all the

463
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:30,240
 perspectives but all the bits with um chadwell and mr. stracy like were strangely not funny

464
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,520
 anyway i'm sure they used to be in the book and i don't know whether that's yeah because i have

465
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,560
 changed all the book because that the tv doesn't work as well as a book that was a bit rambly um

466
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:45,360
 so good omens too i am tentatively hopeful because there isn't a book there's just discussions that

467
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,200
 no gay men terry pratchett had about a sequel that they never wrote so there isn't sort of a

468
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,120
 uh a book that they will follow very very slavishly and maybe insist on keeping all the funny lines

469
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,520
 in from it because they'll have to write the funny lines afresh and i think this could be good

470
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,280
 because it might mean you get something better suited to tv it sounds like they got john finamore

471
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,440
 who the small amounts john finamore i've listened to were very good and everyone tells me i should

472
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,200
 go and listen to more john finamore so maybe i will go and spend three hours on a plane listening to

473
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,400
 john finamore souvenir program um so i'm tentatively hopeful oh there is one thing i would say Liz

474
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,880
 which is how much do you enjoy laughing until you cry in front of strangers on a plane oh that might

475
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,200
 be a problem because i can't take no ask off to blow my nose so maybe i'll have to wait until i'm in

476
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:35,120
 quarantine so you see i'm sort of tentatively optimistic but i'm not like jumping up and down

477
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,680
 and being very excited yet but i did think david tenant and michael sean were very very good

478
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,040
 sorry i i will echo everything you just said um in the same position that good omens was one of

479
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,240
 my very favorite books is i discovered it in the school library and and yeah like you reread it

480
00:48:52,240 --> 00:49:01,680
 multiple times um and loved it and also i i enjoyed the first season of the tv show um but i think i

481
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,240
 was i am in the same boat as you that when i heard that season two was happening which i actually

482
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,200
 heard of punctuation it did not film me with joy i was like oh cool i probably watched that and it

483
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,240
 is very much the news that that finamore has attached that has taken me up um but i will say i do find

484
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,560
 your game and funny i i find um especially um oh god what's it called the one in london never where

485
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,640
 especially never where i i remember finding very funny when i read um so i don't know i mean he's

486
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,280
 nowhere near as funny as pranjai i think that is it would be ludicrous for me to try and hug you

487
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,680
 otherwise um even if it meant we got letters uh but um but yeah i think i probably find it more

488
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:46,320
 funny than us and it sounds like i like game and well enough i just don't think that his humor is

489
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:52,560
 the primary thing that's good about his work um i am enough older than either of you that

490
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:59,760
 i was an actual adult at the point where good ermans came out i i saw you i saw you reacting very

491
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,000
 sadly when me and liz were saying that and i was like sorry alla said that was an accident

492
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,760
 and i i enjoyed it i enjoyed it very much i thought it was a very good novel i

493
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:16,720
 but it didn't have the same formative influence on me that it did for people who read it as a

494
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,080
 as a young teen i'm fairly sure it was my introduction to both game and and pratchet

495
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,360
 i might be wrong about that but i think it it's solved very well
