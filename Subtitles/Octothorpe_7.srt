00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 Amazingly creating VR social spaces is one of the things that I am particularly interested in. You never get it.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
 It turns out I was born to to run parties without having to tidy up the house

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,520
 before or afterwards.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:29,040
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very seventh episode of Octa Thor.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,560
 A podcast about science fiction and science fiction fandom.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,600
 We are sponsored this week by Stow shirts. I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,240
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,000
 For those listeners who are reading the news and Twitter and Facebook and sort of generally

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,200
 staying up to date, there have been widespread protests against police brutality and the treatment

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,840
 of black people in the United States of America for most of the last week.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,520
 Here at Octa Thor we are aware that a lot of you may be listening to us to get away from the

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,600
 terrible and awful news happening out there in the wider world but equally we as a trio feel

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:24,480
 quite strongly about social justice and we are very much standing with the protesters as we are all

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,440
 white. We are not necessarily the best people tell you where to go to educate yourself.

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,360
 So if the listeners of Octa Thorpe have any suggestions for literature or for places to donate

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,520
 money then please send us locks and tell us where we can donate money and what we can recommend

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,480
 to our listeners in order to help them educate themselves about everything that's happening at

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,320
 the moment. If you want to start educating yourself about black writers of speculative

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,080
 fiction you could go and look at Fire Magazine and we'll put a link in the show notes to that

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,760
 too and there's also the Black Spec Fic Report which reports on kind of the state of the industry.

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,440
 The writer survey I think is quite American centric. I'm not sure about the contributors to

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
 Fire Mag but I believe it is based in the USA so if anyone knows of any equivalent

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760
 initiatives in the UK I'd like to hear about them.

24
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,520
 And I should say I've had a couple of people as always happens when there's anything trending

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,640
 getting in touch with me and saying have you made this badge or this t-shirt or this thing and I

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,880
 would suggest that you should go and get your protest gear from black and minority ethnic owned

27
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:49,920
 businesses. In Letter of Comment news we had a conversation of comment with Lillian Edwards

28
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,800
 at the first Thursday pub meeting in which she told us that Ian Sorenson says that my microphone

29
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,080
 is better now which is true it is. Hoorah!

30
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:11,120
 Last time we recorded was in the middle of Bulticon which was being held virtually. It is the

31
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,880
 Baltimore SF Groups Convention it's held every year and they did a variety of programming and

32
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,720
 social spaces on the internet and we decided not to talk about it last week because it was still

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,960
 happening but what did we think of Bulticon? Did we go to Bulticon? Liz it's rather a

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,960
 wrong time zone for you I understand. Yes really everything is in the wrong time zone for me but see

35
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,560
 many many podcasts previously complaining about this so I didn't it's like I keep meaning to go

36
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,480
 to things but it's one that they're in the wrong time zone but also that every time there is a

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,920
 convention I have to then work out what is its local time zone and how does that compare to my

38
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:59,120
 time zone and what time actually is it and usually I never get to the third stage so I had to say

39
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,320
 one thing I would implore virtual conventions to do is to maybe put somewhere in small letters their

40
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,480
 time in like UTC or something just to make it easy for us all to work out what time it would be

41
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,640
 in our own time zone. That is a good idea actually that should be a thing that happens.

42
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,840
 I'm sure people from Conzil and listening to this podcast I am not sure people from Conzil and

43
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,960
 listening to this podcast. I was intending to spend quite a lot of my weekend at those conventions

44
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:36,560
 both at Wiscan and Bulticon and it mostly didn't happen and I'm not entirely sure why not I kind

45
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,640
 of dropped into the discord's a bit and they were fine but I never found like the buzzing zoom party

46
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:53,200
 of my dreams or anything of that kind and I didn't go to any program items because I have a problem

47
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,160
 with my life at the moment which is that for all the time lockdown and can't do any of the things

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,240
 I would normally do I am incredibly busy all the time. I have no idea how this has happened but it

49
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,080
 clearly has happened and I'm surrounded by things I should be doing all of the time. Yes and so I

50
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,720
 didn't get to a lot of it. I did talk a little I understand that Bulticon was an enormous success

51
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,920
 and I talked a little bit to some people who had had a good time and they really liked lots of

52
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,120
 things about the way that it worked. My wife, Spania, also attended Bulticon and she wrote a

53
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,720
 very excellent blog post about it and she basically sent me a text message saying I didn't lock but

54
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:43,360
 here's a blog post so I will include a link to the blog post in the show notes and you can go and

55
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,040
 read her thoughts on everything. Spania did an awful lot of socialising on this board in the

56
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,760
 text chat so she had quite a different opinion of it than me and Alison did which is interesting.

57
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,520
 She I think thought it worked very well but she also went to some of the zoom parties and she

58
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:11,200
 thought that that was good. Right and I also talked to the Glasgow in 2024 team who said it was a

59
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,320
 lot of fun but not very many people came to our room party so we're now worried about room parties

60
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,400
 at Conzeland and will you run them all and I said no I would not run them all but I will run one

61
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,760
 and they said it won't be very difficult because only a very few people will come and I'm like

62
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,840
 not if I'm running it so I'm telling you now I'm going to have an awesome and enormous room party

63
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,280
 at Conzeland and it will be timed at like I don't know eight o'clock in the morning UK time but you

64
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,680
 know just day drinking it's the best. I will say that the problem I think the Glasgow in 2024 room

65
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,600
 party at Bulticon had was that I did not know it was on so I did not attend and I feel as someone

66
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,320
 who is a pre-supporter of Glasgow in 2024 and man who was at Bulticon I perhaps should be in the

67
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,880
 middle of the Venn diagram of people who heard about this room party so I do think there might

68
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,640
 have made a slight problem with the communication there because I would have been there with bells

69
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,360
 on had I realized it was happening. I think you had to look look down a long chain of information on

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,840
 Discord to find the Discord channel that was Glasgow in 2024 and then go to that and I think there was

71
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,800
 an issue with multiple nested Discords possibly rather too many of them. I think part of the

72
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,840
 problem is that like I don't know why they didn't advertise it on the Glasgow in 2024 mailing list

73
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,760
 for instance which I subscribe to yeah if it's a virtual thing that anyone could come to you can

74
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,040
 make it buzzing by advertising on your mailing list and then people will come. I do think that

75
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,240
 there should have been and I don't know if there was I suppose I could double check as we record

76
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,280
 there should have been like a room party/social um notice board equivalent on the Bulticon

77
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,400
 Discord if there was one of those I'm not sure I really noticed it but that probably should have

78
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,560
 been like quite prominent. I will say so I went to Bulticon I did not go to any Zoom parties because

79
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,360
 they all started after I went to bed and I am some sort of lame person who goes to bed before 2am

80
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,680
 but I will say that generally speaking I enjoyed the panels I went to I went to three or four panels

81
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,880
 I went to a panel on Star Wars the end of the saga which I thought was going to be a super great

82
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,480
 panel like looking at the nine part thing and like how it went and what they should have done

83
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,480
 differently and what they could take away and actually devolved into people just talking about

84
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,720
 their favourite parts from their past strikes back which if a modest wasn't quite the angle I wanted

85
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,960
 from the panel and I eventually gave up I do wish that panelists would read the panel description

86
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,080
 like it's my biggest bugbear just guys there's a description of what the panel's about please

87
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,880
 discuss that because that's why I clicked um the other two that I went to were both on tabletop

88
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,600
 games and they were actually really really really good um I really enjoyed the way that the Zoom

89
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,320
 kind of webinar mode lets you ask questions and stuff and then people from those panels were hanging

90
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,760
 out in the discord text chat after the panels and you got to talk to them a bit more there

91
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
 and you also got to see people talking about other gaming panels you might not have been to

92
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,120
 and that actually worked really well so I think I think from my perspective I kind of mostly ignored

93
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,000
 the dealer's room the artist Sally and the fan tables on the discord but the little gaming segment

94
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,200
 with the different channels worked quite well I think next time I would probably um I would

95
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,240
 probably advise condensing the discord channels for the dealers and artists of anti-ables a little

96
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,600
 bit because I think there was just way too much variety there um but I can see why they did that

97
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,040
 but I'm not sure it was what they should have done um but I think these things will be things

98
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,840
 that we get better at over time and I think baltz college the first place I've seen do this with

99
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,120
 what I would say was quite a high level of success so um I I thought it was quite good I was quite

100
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,240
 encouraged I will say harking back uh several minutes at this point Glasgow in 2024 did put it on

101
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,280
 their twitter feed and I wonder if they're trying to do the sort of thing where they keep their

102
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,760
 mailing list low volume announcements and announce things like an upcoming party in two days on

103
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,800
 their twitter feed so that might be part of the issue okay so so twitter's a terrible way to

104
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,720
 announce anything unless you announce it every half hour for because how people use twitter is

105
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,280
 that when they're on twitter they dip in and a twitter stream rushes past them nobody's actually

106
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:42,080
 reading everything that the 9 000 people they follow um posts every single time it's it's even

107
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,480
 worse than facebook for that um and at least if you put something on facebook and lots of people

108
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,200
 say they are going then eventually facebook will go oh yes that's an event I should probably show

109
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,040
 you well and the other thing is that I like the Glasgow in 2024 page on facebook so if they had

110
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,760
 made it into a facebook event presumably they could have invited me and I would have seen it that way

111
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,640
 but I will agree that twitter is great and I think it's very good for many things but the thing I

112
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,960
 think it's absolutely awful for is announcements because as as Alison just said like the algorithm

113
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,640
 means that I don't see posts in the order they were published anyway and if twitter doesn't show

114
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,760
 me that tweet then I there's no way for me to see it and the thing I love about mailing lists is

115
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,520
 that when someone says me an email I read the email and that is a one-to-one correspondence which

116
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,560
 which facebook and twitter are sadly algorithmically eroding uh which I get I fully understand why

117
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,760
 they're doing that but it does it frustrates me when stuff is announced on twitter and I'm like but

118
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,080
 I never could have seen that because I have run mailing lists I now know that when you used to

119
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,640
 send things to people in the post you never really understood how many people were reading them

120
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,800
 but when you email people you do learn how many people are reading them because mail chimp or

121
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,240
 whatever you're using will give you a read percentage and if you're doing well that read

122
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,200
 percentage is somewhere in the margin in the order like a convention mail app will probably get a

123
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:15,520
 40% open rate and that's the reason why conventions are kind of going will mail you less will will

124
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,680
 not use the mailing list as people just aren't reading their email no I understand I do think

125
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,520
 it's probably better not to pepper people with email so I do I understand the tensions but what

126
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,720
 you actually do to announce things is you have multiple channels you get in touch with the people

127
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,520
 that you want to be at your fantastic buzzing party and say will you be there and they go yes of

128
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,280
 course I wouldn't miss it for the world and you go can you tell all your friends on your podcast

129
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,560
 or whatever yeah and you actually you know it's like any any other event would be that you do have

130
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,520
 to market things a little bit more aggressively than just sticking up your hands saying we are

131
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,600
 running a room party at bolticon and of course you busy people all over the world who are overwhelmed

132
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,680
 by the amount of stuff you have to do on the internet at the moment will immediately think of

133
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,000
 our party as being the first thing that you want to do it's become clear that that in fact Facebook

134
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,400
 marketing for conventions is quite effective at has been effective at pulling in people who would

135
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,960
 not habitually have got the easter con the easter con the makeup of the easter con has changed

136
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,440
 extremely dramatically over the last five years and although long con gets some of the credit for

137
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:34,960
 that it's also the fact that we accidentally reached out to a broader community by just doing very

138
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:42,160
 basic social media stuff and and also by the people who go talking about it and and raising

139
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,400
 bells for it and i don't see any reason why you can't do that with the online conventions

140
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,680
 as well you just have to make sure that you've got a a value proposition that is compelling at

141
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,680
 times when people have a lot of other things on their plate

142
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:08,080
 on the topic of value propositions consieland have announced that they are also going to use a

143
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:16,240
 mixture of zoom and discord to run their convention and one question we had when we read this is

144
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,360
 what is the value proposition of this given that bolt con has done this seemingly free at the

145
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:31,120
 point of use so um uh listen did you want to start talking about this and then me and Liz can jump

146
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,840
 in with our excellent opinions i wanted to 100% make clear that i am pontificating from a

147
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,320
 complete state of ignorance here and i wanted to say that i guess that bolt con probably wasn't

148
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:51,040
 free um that they will have had there a convention that doesn't that runs every year so they will

149
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,840
 have things like a corporate structure and a bank account and a set of and and they would have

150
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,200
 been able to put some money into this in the knowledge that they will have um future physical

151
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,760
 conventions in a way that conventions that only run once like a world con may not be able to so

152
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,680
 it is possible that it was not as free as all of that um these will all be tied together with a

153
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:23,040
 single sign in point for authentication so so i feel like conzeland is planning to wall off its

154
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,440
 garden and i i guess that bolt con because it was free didn't need to wall off its garden and i i

155
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,280
 guess is that the the process of saying only con see on only conzeland members are going to be

156
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:43,520
 inside the loop here will make this more expensive uh and if you can spot the floor in that reasoning

157
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,720
 i think you're right i think that bolt con almost certainly as a continuing convention has a reserve

158
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,400
 that they can probably call upon because they are an established organization that has been going

159
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,320
 for a while and will have a continuity the disadvantage in this sense that world cons have is that each

160
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,680
 world con for those who don't know is a separate organization uh and so there is no um continuity

161
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,800
 in the amount of of money on the organization that you have available to you other than what other

162
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,800
 world cons have been able to donate to you and i don't know how much Dublin did in donating to

163
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,760
 conzeland but i wouldn't be surprised if it was relatively low because i suspect Dublin spent

164
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,880
 quite a lot of money on running their convention and so it might well be that this is mostly driven

165
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,280
 by the father bolt con might have a source of stability that conzeland doesn't and so it might

166
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:45,360
 well be a slightly unfair comparison to make in some ways if you look at the easter con easter cons

167
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
 pass along money between easter cons and these pass alongs can often be quite large um compared

168
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,600
 to the relatively small budget of an easter con um and and they've been getting bigger um and we

169
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,680
 intended when running fully con to reduce the size of the pass along deliberately because we

170
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,560
 thought they were slightly too large um but we we did end up passing along quite a lot of money

171
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:11,760
 and we will use i think it is likely that most of that money is going to get used up dealing with

172
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,520
 this year's easter con refunding where it needed to and the incurring the expenses it couldn't get

173
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,400
 out of and then next year's easter con coping with what is likely to be a very disrupted

174
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,440
 easter con for a number of ways and i would suspect that between those two we will probably not have

175
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,320
 very much pass along at all left at the end of it um so it's kind of like oh yes easter con has

176
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,400
 been saving for a rainy day and that is a thing that that it's done now i imagine that conzeland

177
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,840
 has an enormous amount of incurred expenses that it cannot get out i think there's also one extra

178
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,560
 aspect that conzeland will have to deal with i think bolticon in a way could have sort of open

179
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:54,800
 zoom and open discord and largely fly under the radar and i didn't hear anything about any problems

180
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,640
 they had but i think a world con is a much more visible entity and also the world con has had

181
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,560
 problems in the past well you know will con is a higher profile thing and it has uh you know had

182
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,560
 the whole thing with the puppies and the hugo nominations and it's possible they also feel

183
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,600
 that a they need to be a little bit more of a walled gardener to put some effort into making

184
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,680
 sure that no one disrupts their higher profile event and also into more people points to do

185
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:32,160
 moderation and to try and keep things as safe as possible um for everyone when they do have the

186
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,600
 event just because of numbers so i don't think any of these open events have had problems so far

187
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,960
 but it's it's not hard to think of a world in which they could have problems from a bunch of

188
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,080
 bored people deciding to disrupt proceedings

189
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:58,320
 i think that segues quite nicely into a discussion about what the relative strengths of zoom and

190
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,280
 discord are in this space my understanding is that one of the reasons discord has gotten more popular

191
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,760
 recently is because they've recently introduced an awful lot of features to allow for that kind

192
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,160
 of effective moderation to be more easily implemented and i saw that there were to get into the bolt

193
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,360
 econ you had to agree to a code of conduct before you were allowed to enter the bolt econ discord

194
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,200
 and there were moderators who were able to step in but i think you're right that cons elend will

195
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,240
 have a harder time with that it will be a much bigger enterprise but i think it's interesting

196
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,800
 that the way that do you see the the way that discord can be used to facilitate that kind of

197
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,200
 code of conduct might be one of the reasons we're seeing that as the like spokes in between the zooms

198
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,160
 which are the kind of panels and room parties um and i think that's a really good use of the two

199
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,600
 technologies really playing both to their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses

200
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,200
 discourse strength being like the fact it's always there and you can always go and it's got the

201
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,120
 moderation and zoom strengths being that the video quality is higher it's a lot easier to get started

202
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,920
 like you just click a link and it appears um and you can do the webinar boat stuff which is all

203
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,200
 kind of baked in um very much playing to the strengths of both platforms yeah i mean i think

204
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,840
 it's quite clear that a combination of zoom and discord is very good for all this stuff i mean i

205
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:30,960
 haven't i've not thought about running a party in the form of um having the having the actual party

206
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,880
 going on in discord with a set of video chats but that might be a better way to run big parties i

207
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,240
 don't know um i'm still i'm still amazed that nobody has really solved the problem of running

208
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,280
 big parties it's given that it's been months now and given that big parties are one of the things

209
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,640
 that humans like to do a lot i know i just keep talking about parties all the time um when we get

210
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,600
 to what i'm doing to stay set in the pocket it's one of the things i've been looking at is whether

211
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,520
 there are any really good vr party apps because it feels like vr parties ought to be totally a thing

212
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,160
 that could solve all of these problems but you know what they're not or at least if they are

213
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,240
 that i haven't found one yet and actually one of the things that we were talking about um i'm

214
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,320
 almost certain it was on one of allesans in terminable zoom parties um possibly after a tap

215
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,680
 pop possibly after a tap zoom maybe it's a lot of pop music maybe a thursday uh they're lovely

216
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:32,240
 but there are many of them and they all slightly blur into one which i enjoy about them um and also

217
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,080
 i've just googled in terminable and they are endless you are always zooming allison it is 100%

218
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,560
 that i i do not believe you will ever stop partying i am actually slightly less zooming than i would

219
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:52,640
 like to um i feel like i i'm not i'm not running fewer events than i'd like to but i i kind of find

220
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,360
 i get to the beginning of weekend and goes who's running a party this weekend and they're never

221
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,960
 quite enough of those people so maybe there are great parties going on to which i am not being

222
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,960
 invited but they probably are but i feel like i mean i never was going to invite me to loads of

223
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,800
 things now i'm going to have to go no no but i would like that to be more things out there that i could

224
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,000
 just kind of drop into if i feel like it where people will be having buzz but i will say that

225
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,320
 jerry was saying that balticon also had a presence on second life where you could go and interact

226
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,200
 with people in second life and i was like and it gets better what you were saying about yeah about

227
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:44,240
 VR like party like it's 1999 Liz do you use second life avid second life user i have never used second

228
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,360
 life mean either i used it in 1999 i don't know what was it actually 1999 i'm just checking but yeah

229
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,360
 no and i think that gets back to what you're saying about like it would be it sounds like what you

230
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,840
 want is a VR world where you could go and like more realistically interact and then i heard that

231
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,880
 they were doing a second life thing and i'm like oh no because i think that's the attempt to do

232
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,200
 something like that but i just don't think it actually works or provides that experience in any

233
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,320
 meaningful way and hopefully one day but not not today but kudos to them for trying i don't think

234
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,800
 conzeland has announced their aggressive second life uh home utilization yet and obviously i think

235
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,320
 i speak for all three of us when i say i'm waiting with baited breath to see what they plan i am

236
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,120
 actually wrong apparently you can party like it's 2003

237
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,920
 excellent

238
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:50,880

249
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:50,640
 we should we should talk briefly about the nebulous and wizcon which we i think i speak for three of

250
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:58,000
 us did not attend but allison gosson sleeky gossip before the nebulous happened so um

251
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,440
 when it wasn't really sneaky gossip steven silvers said he'd been running um zoom parties along

252
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,520
 the lines of the ones that i've been running for up to 500 people with a lot of rut of i he'd

253
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,480
 been running them for up to 150 people with a plan to run for up to 500 on nebula weekend and

254
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,800
 i've heard nothing i feel like if 500 people are gone to a to the nebula party i would have heard

255
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,360
 about it but they were probably all american science fiction authors so maybe not but if you

256
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,600
 were at the nebula zoom party do let us know how it went so he was using the same system as we do

257
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,560
 where you have a lot of breakout rooms people move between them he was doing a thing very cleverly

258
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:40,480
 where he put everybody into a lobby and then he had moderators in the lobby trying to divide people

259
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,360
 up into smaller rooms i slightly worry that that leaves you with hundreds of people in the lobby

260
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,080
 and he was leaving people in the waiting room until he had a bunch of say six so then he bring them

261
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,480
 all in at once and um give them the spiel about how it was going to work and things like that um

262
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,760
 but i don't that was all in the practice which is what we talked about so steven if you're listening

263
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,720
 then that would be a great thing to know about how it went and um yeah and if you're not listening

264
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,920
 if anyone was at the nebula zoom party i really really want to know how it went the one thing i

265
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,840
 must say i really dislike about zoom is the bit where you wait for the host to notice that you

266
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,640
 want to party and they eventually let you into their party but it's i guess a bit like queuing to get

267
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,640
 into a room party as a world con so it's a pleasing recreation of a fannish tradition it's replicating

268
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,400
 that bit of the party where you decide to go to party and you get a drink and you sort of hang

269
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,480
 around at the edge to want to work out if you know anyone at this party or if you're just gonna stand

270
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,000
 around looking like you are a cool loner it's actually replicating the part where you're

271
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,960
 standing on the doorstep and your hostess had a has engrossed in conversation and the last thing

272
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,200
 we want to do right now is open the door the second

273
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:05,440
 the other thing we did not attend was wizcon do Liz do you know anything about wizcon yes i have

274
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:13,840
 been to wizcon quite a long time ago now uh 2006 and i enjoyed it but i've never managed to go back

275
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,080
 so i was sort of thinking about trying to go back when it was a virtual convention but i completely

276
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,240
 failed to do so because of inertia and time zones but they i think they were paid as well so i would

277
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,240
 have had to make a proper commitment to working out if i could go to things really before you

278
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,200
 couldn't sort of dip in and out um but it is the of the ones that were running on memorial the day

279
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:42,080
 what that was the one i would quite have liked to go to registration for wizcon cost $10 you could

280
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,480
 pay zero dollars if you could not afford the $10 and they also had membership levels at $25 and

281
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:56,480
 $55 for those who felt able to more support the convention so it wasn't um it wasn't sort of

282
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,560
 conziedland levels of money um but it was sort of a small tip i hadn't realized it was only $10

283
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,640
 um i think i must have seen one of the higher numbers and decided i need to think about it if

284
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,160
 it's only $10 and that is within my realm of yep i'll just take a plunge on that and if i don't end

285
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,160
 up going to any of the events well i like wizcon and they can have my $10 yes no that's that is fair

286
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,880
 i was i don't know whether baltachon had a tip jar but it does occur to me as well that you you

287
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,280
 really need to have some sort of like paper or or drip or whatever other service um tip jar

288
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,880
 um on your um on your convention website to allow people to contribute to the costs i think

289
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:48,320
 i'm still very much looking forward to conziedland i am i think part of the thing about the virtual

290
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,640
 trip is trying to get myself into a headspace where i really am focusing when you there's a focus

291
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,000
 thing when you decide to go to an actual convention in actual life you go right i am going off

292
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,960
 if we ever have these again i go somewhere for the weekend and i spend my weekend there and i do

293
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,480
 the convention when a virtual convention comes into your life you're kind of like oh i'm doing

294
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,120
 everything else i'm doing else and then also there's this convention going on and i think actually

295
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,640
 saying no i'm i'm going to block out three days and the convention is going to be what i do for

296
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,160
 those three days is a very different way to think about these and i'm not sure how many of us are

297
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,080
 doing that just yet did that make any sense that did make sense because i think when i was

298
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,840
 thinking about oh should i try and get to any of these uh online conventions over the moral day

299
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,400
 weekend i was thinking about it and oh i might dip in and out of some events if they're in the

300
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,200
 right time so and i wasn't thinking i will take the plunge and commit my weekend to it as i normally

301
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,520
 would for convention yes i think i think that's fair and i think that was very much the

302
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,320
 thing i did with um bolticon was i signed up for the panels that i was interested in going to and

303
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,240
 were in the right time zone and then i didn't really think i was attending bolticon but i got to go

304
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,880
 to some cool panels which is the way i was thinking about it but i think if there was going to be

305
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:17,040
 a convention i usually attend happening virtually i would be taking that as a i will block

306
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:23,520
 the time out and do this as if i am at the convention and the next convention for which that happens

307
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:31,440
 is probably going to be the virtual uk games expo which is being held in mid-August they have

308
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:39,280
 cancelled the physical one and they are holding a virtual one and i will be thoroughly and enthusiastically

309
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,400
 attending oh how much does it cost and what are its dates uh so it's the 21st of august

310
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:54,320
 um to the 23rd of august i have found the part on the website uh we've decided to make virtually

311
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,760
 expo freely available to anyone who wants to join in so there are no entry tickets but there will be

312
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,240
 the option to donate and some activities such as role-playing games and tournaments will still

313
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,640
 require individual tickets and will attract a small fee in order to participate so free to attend the

314
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,400
 sort of show floor but perhaps small amounts of money to attend some of the events happening

315
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:23,120
 they're using twitch discord zoom youtube um it's being sponsored by paizo and walen games and

316
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:31,200
 wahammer and katann um so big sponsors i i had not heard of uk online games expo and because

317
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,200
 gaming conventions are one of the things that i very very much enjoy but have had to decide

318
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:46,160
 or a piece of life that is too much for me um you know i can't manage to squeeze them into my life

319
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:52,240
 i'm actually extremely excited about the idea of a virtual one and um i might walk over long to

320
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,400
 that so that's quite exciting it's going to be very interesting to see how some of the tournaments

321
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,840
 are run because asthma d which is one of the big big board game companies in the world has been

322
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:08,080
 clamping down on methods to virtually play their games in recent weeks and it will be interesting

323
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,080
 to see how you run a tournament for a game that has no official digital client and the parent

324
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,200
 company of which has been strongly discouraging online play so i don't know whether those will

325
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,640
 actually happen or what they will look like if they do but you know which games are asthma d what

326
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,440
 are they what games are they famous for john so they do anything with the arkham horror branding is

327
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:39,040
 asthma d anything with the star wars branding is asthma d unless it's hasbro but there aren't any

328
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:46,240
 tournaments for hasbro games anything with legends of the five rings branding game of thrones branding

329
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,880
 katan is asthma d like if it's not if it's not hasbro and it's not wizards of the coast

330
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:03,360
 it's probably aspody it's basically breaks down ticket to ride pandemic uh kakasan small world

331
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,320
 misterium i'm not sure they originally developed all of those but they've sort of swallowed up some

332
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:15,360
 smaller companies at this point so essentially huge swathes of games are now aspody they've been

333
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,160
 eating companies and then they recently got sold to a venture capital company and you know

334
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:26,640
 capitalism is is great obviously wouldn't hear a word against it but um but yeah slightly sad

335
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,520
 oh so the basis they're basically the electronic arts of board games oh geez that is a particularly

336
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,920
 good comparison which makes me very very sad Alison so essentially the bit where you're starting

337
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,480
 to spend too much money on arkam aura you have no idea how that's going for you uh right let's move

338
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:58,640
 on we should talk about the hugo voter packet on the subject of things which are terrific value

339
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:05,040
 um i signed up for a supporting membership to conziland after the last episode of octa thought

340
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,520
 and i have downloaded my hugo voter packet Alison and Liz have you downloaded hugo voter packets?

341
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,480
 i have but it took me so long to download my hugo voter packet which is enormous i had to have a

342
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,800
 little lie down after that so i haven't really looked at it very much but you have told me that

343
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,360
 it has the whole of the wicked and the divine in it and i am very excited about that because the

344
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,640
 wicked and divine is an excellent graphic novel that everyone should read yes it has the entire

345
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,320
 of wicked and the divine and it also has the entire of monstrous and the entire of paper girls in it

346
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,680
 so all of the back issues for those comics are available and i think Liz is particularly excited

347
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:47,040
 well i have already read all of wicked as well so i do not need that from my

348
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,160
 voter packet i basically haven't signed up to conziland yet but i am considering signing up for

349
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,120
 supporting membership um basically i will sign up for supporting membership in a very

350
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,680
 mercenary way if the amount of stuff i haven't read which is in the voter packet makes it seem

351
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,880
 like a worthwhile proposition and then i basically get to vote in the hughos as a bonus okay i'm

352
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:18,960
 i'm going to put my grumpy old fart cap on now and go i believe in the world con community and i

353
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,400
 think that it is worth buying a supporting membership to the world con each year even for years in

354
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,960
 which you could not possibly travel to it because we are we are one if you can afford it obviously

355
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,280
 because people have to pay that spend their money on different things because we are one community

356
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,440
 and and having the membership every year and voting in site selection and the hughos and being

357
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,560
 part of the world con community is a bigger thing than any one world con and you understand that

358
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,040
 sometimes the world con will go to places that you cannot possibly get to don't go where i can't

359
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,080
 follow yeah like that i do by supporting memberships to the world con every year for exactly those

360
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,840
 reasons the reason i bought the cons unit one very late is because i thought i had voted

361
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:10,080
 in site selection at sam house a but i can find no evidence that this thought was actually based in

362
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:16,160
 fact or anything approaching evidence so um having reluctantly conceded i might not have done

363
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,800
 that i eventually bought a supporting membership um but yes usually i vote in site selection and

364
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,320
 that gets me my supporting membership um without me having to do anything else but this time it does

365
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,960
 not appear to have worked which is probably my own stupid fault it's true that sounds so i sound

366
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,000
 overly obsessed with free stuff at this point i have bought quite a lot of supporting memberships

367
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,840
 in various conventions and world cons in the past i don't know why i never got around to buying one

368
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,680
 for cons eland i think it is now clear that the that the hugo that putting your things in the

369
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,960
 hugo but voting pack does encourage people to pay attention to them and maybe vote for them and

370
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,240
 certainly increases the chance that they will win the hugo but probably is also quite good advertising

371
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:13,760
 for things generally i worry slightly about the tendency for people to buy a by hug by world

372
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,640
 con memberships just for the hugo pack because it's not quite that's what gave us the sad puppies

373
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,600
 but that's what gives us a group of people who are interested in the world con only for

374
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:34,480
 what it can provide as a reading service and and that seems a bit of a shame yes i don't want to

375
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,600
 suggest that the only reason to support the world con is the hugo voter packet but obviously the hugo

376
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:48,960
 voter packet is a pretty fantastic perk that one gets if one is in that community and i will say that

377
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,240
 i have oftentimes used the hugo voter packet as a way to try to encourage friends who are perhaps

378
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,400
 less in the world con fandom to support the world con and maybe bring them slightly more into the

379
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:11,120
 fandom which is i think also a kind of good carrot to use if that makes sense it's true i also feel

380
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:19,040
 that i am sufficiently embedded in world con fandom and have given quite a lot of my effort in

381
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:26,080
 kind to world cons in the past but i don't feel i always need to support them with my money that's

382
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:32,880
 fair for those who don't know liz has deputy department headed or sorry no liz has deputy division

383
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,040
 headed at world cons in the past a job which is very difficult allison has also deputy division

384
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,480
 headed in the past a job which was very difficult and i have also deputy division headed in the past

385
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,760
 a job which was very difficult so um we are all speaking as deeply entrenched members of world con

386
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,200
 fandom who have never been quite daft enough to rise to the position of full division head

387
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,080
 which would be insane this is where allison is like i was division head of something and i'm like oh

388
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:13,120
 no why no no i've been area head i was area head at 1995 and 2005 and i was a ddh at 2014 and have

389
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:20,880
 no further intention have no ambitions in that direction at all yes the only one of us who

390
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,880
 will ever chair a world con is of course liz i've been going down in responsibility i've gone from

391
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,120
 deputy division head to area head to person who hangs around a bit because they know how the

392
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,240
 programming database works so clearly my next role will be just hanging around for no reason whatsoever

393
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,320
 excellent i think i should say that it isn't a progress so i have been i did area head jobs

394
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:52,560
 two uk world hogs and then a ddh job but at other world cons i have also taken quite dull staff roles

395
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,320
 like for example the person whose job it was to inject jokes into the newsletter and that sort of

396
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,240
 thing that's a pretty vital role

397
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:10,640
 shall we move on staying sane in the apocalypse aka allison attempts to bring the entire world

398
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,280
 to her house so what have i done i've run some more to do parties one of the exciting things that

399
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,880
 happened this month is that facebook um included a checkbox on events for this event is happening

400
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,120
 online which has stopped the repeated messages that i and all my attendees were getting saying

401
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,520
 are you really going to an event with 50 people don't you know that that's not allowed under the

402
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,560
 lockdown rules so now it has a little checkbox where you can say my event is happening online

403
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,840
 but being facebook i slightly worry that what zuckerberg is doing is trying to because now i get

404
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,240
 a lot of advertising from facebook about how wouldn't i be rather using facebook's social media

405
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,320
 facebook's video conferencing tools to which the arts reason though i am still using a combination

406
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,800
 of zoom and breakout rooms because i've not yet found anything better but i could be persuaded into

407
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:04,080
 discord instead and yes i'm running big resumes i'm running small zooms i'm i've not gone into

408
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,040
 the enormous i kind of think once you've got about 20 or 30 people that's probably enough for

409
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,280
 for me to have a fantastic time and there's an extent to which i don't necessarily care about

410
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,880
 anybody else and i have bought a VR rig that's why i bought an ukulex quest i might my child stopped

411
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:28,320
 working for me on the completely spurious excuse that she was studying for her finals and therefore

412
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,200
 did not have any time to make badges for minimum wage they'll notice that she does have time to run a

413
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,240
 turnip empire on animal crossing but you know people make their own priorities i mean to be

414
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,320
 fair allison you're benefiting from the i was about to say i am benefiting from the truth

415
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,840
 from the turnip empire but obviously you're benefiting from the vegetables

416
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:54,800
 all right that's it stop the podcast episode seven were peaked there's nowhere down there

417
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,920
 nowhere but downhill from here right um so instead i basically had to do all the minimum wage batch

418
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,840
 making it shipping work last month and at the end of the month i looked at what i thought i would

419
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,680
 have paid for the number of hours i had spent doing it and i bought an ukulex quest um and also

420
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,120
 because i i had said when i decided to buy nothing that i would spend my money on experiences rather

421
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:23,200
 than things and if i still can't get out of my house to do anything then clearly sticking a headset

422
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:32,080
 on and and going and swimming with dolphins or or um playing some vr game is is as close as i can

423
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,440
 get to new experiences and they are new experiences it was like utterly science fictional it was

424
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,240
 completely sense of wonder for me now i mean i i've obviously used some vr stuff before but

425
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,160
 there's something about the fact it doesn't use wires so it's just wherever you happen to be so

426
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,520
 you can take a tiny patch of your house from which you've managed to clear clutter and then you put

427
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,040
 this headset on it suddenly or in a gorgeous geodesic dome that has been tastefully furnished by somebody

428
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,840
 else and in you go oh i can see how we might all be doing this um and um it's equal parts of oh my

429
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,520
 god this is a really futuristic feeling and oh my god the world as i know it is going to collapse i

430
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:20,560
 look at what has happened between when i bought my nintendo game and watch in 1980 and the oculus

431
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:27,440
 quest and i extrapolate forward and i'm like we are going to get to the point where real life

432
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:34,640
 does not necessarily have a lot to offer that is better than these systems it is the opinion of

433
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:41,440
 the octa thought podcast that we should all live in small pods plugged into some sort of central

434
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,560
 computer where we socialize without risk of pandemic and is this how the matrix starts allison

435
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:55,200
 is this how the matrix starts that was literally where i got to i was like i can see a world where

436
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,240
 actually people do this in enormous amount and that's the matrix yeah and that was kind of weird

437
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:10,080
 it was a very weird feeling and and and yet when you sort of go well if say facebook's creating

438
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,320
 avatars now and you can see that one of the reasons that facebook's creating avatars is if you want

439
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,680
 to do something that's like second life but works getting people to have realistic consistent

440
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,200
 avatars for themselves is one of the ways in which you make that happen so you go into your virtual

441
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,360
 space and you go oh yeah that's john because i recognize his avatar and yes and this is all

442
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:38,320
 quite the weird thing and but but you know when you're saying well we can't actually go to see

443
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,600
 i still can't see my family and i feel like there's a there's going to be attractions this sort of

444
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:50,640
 thing oh also beat saber is a lot of fun beat saber is is fun beat saber is the only vl game i have

445
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,640
 played and i like rhythm games because they're the only games i'm actually any good at every

446
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,960
 other game i have to put it on easy mode and die a lot and beat saber is just like yep i'm gonna go

447
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,000
 for this and it's it's fine although hard work so beat saber is great have you played any other vl

448
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,800
 games because do they make and someone should have made this a sort of like matrix crossed with half

449
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,160
 live crossed with inception style game where you can do the matrix and run up walls and

450
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:26,800
 reshift reality i think my feeling about games beat saber is fine but beat saber feels to me like

451
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,040
 a tech demo rather than a game i feel like we are so there's a set of games that are coming out now

452
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,080
 that are set at the star wars universe where you get to run around with light saber um but i feel

453
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:44,560
 like we are only at the very beginning of of exploring what you can do with this game space

454
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:53,360
 there is a game called super hot VR which people talk about where you only move the the bad guys

455
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:59,920
 only move when you do you're in a kind of weird matrix like environment there and you and there

456
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,320
 is bullet time so as long as you're not moving the bullets aren't moving and if you start to move

457
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:11,600
 then the bullets move and that is quite freaky and it also is quite intense when they talk about

458
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:17,280
 intense VR experiences they mean they mean roller coasters they mean things that set off your balance

459
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:24,960
 so it's not intense in that way at all but i found it intense in a gaming way i am five foot tall

460
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,360
 and it didn't seem to have any height adjustment so these guys that were coming towards me but

461
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:37,360
 only when i moved were much bigger than i was and that was quite freaky i'm not so i've only played

462
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:43,120
 the demo and i'm not saying i won't buy it but it felt like and i've heard other people talking

463
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:49,280
 about VR is saying that some of the really intense first person shooter games are not working for

464
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,440
 them because it is just all too much so other people really like that sort of stuff but it's just

465
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,880
 early days early days for all this stuff and and there is a game called star trek bridge command

466
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,560
 i think that Ming pointed me at Ming has a headset Ming is in New Zealand Ming and i could play this

467
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,800
 is a cooperative game where you work with other people on the bridge of the enterprise or some

468
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,840
 some federation starship in order to solve problems and i haven't actually played it yet but but

469
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,960
 that's something that feels to me the sort of thing that i am actually looking for which is cooperative

470
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:28,160
 games in VR between people who are not located in the same space in the real world

471
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,240
 for your you know to make up for a thing like ballgame like i like cooperative game gaming generally

472
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,240
 there's apparently a version of keep talking and nobody explodes which is a game which my family

473
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:45,600
 has played endlessly to the death we have absolutely run all the love out all the possible joy out of

474
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,000
 this game at this point but apparently there's a VR version of that so that one of you is sitting

475
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,440
 with headphones and the quest and the the the VR set on with the bomb in front of you and actually

476
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,200
 physically manipulating it and the other people are sitting with the decoding the decoding manual

477
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,440
 trying to tell you what to do um so but i'm not playing that either so i've played a bit of

478
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:15,040
 beat saber and i've done a few i've done some things like i have done some VR um i have played

479
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:22,000
 the star wars VR game on playstation 4 and it made me feel a little bit

480
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,200
 queasy i had to spend some time looking very fixiddly at a planet in the distance in order to

481
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:36,800
 avoid feeling very queasy um so i am and but i'm very much looking forward to VR becoming a bigger

482
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:43,440
 thing because one of the things i really am finding very difficult about the apocalypse is that i

483
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:52,480
 have a weekly roleplay in which we do quite a lot of highly cooperative storytelling and part of the

484
00:48:52,480 --> 00:49:00,400
 problem with zoom and discord and all of these things is that it's very difficult to um pick up

485
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,960
 on other people's social cues in a week in a way that means that everyone can join in without

486
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,000
 having to sort of go around the room pointing at people saying now it's your turn now it's your turn

487
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,120
 because louder voices dominate and quieter voices find it difficult to get a look in

488
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,840
 and this can really disrupt the dynamic so i'm very much looking forward to VR as a mechanism

489
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,800
 for role playing games because i think i hope that VR will be a better way of doing that that

490
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,160
 doesn't fall prey to the same problems that video chatting uh falls prey to so i am sort of

491
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,160
 optimistic and hopeful about the potential for VR chatting as a replacement for video chatting

492
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:44,080
 but i i don't know what timescale that's a realistic um proposition on 20 years like uh

493
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:50,960
 like nuclear fusion right it's 20 years away no i think it depends really on how pandemic goes

494
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:59,760
 because if we are still here in a year um not really going to the pub then i think at that point

495
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,160
 a lot of this stuff will have happened because there will be so infinitely much money in it

496
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,800
 i also did see and i've been looking for the link for ages which is why i've been super quiet

497
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:20,400
 uh someone developed a sort of top down 2d chat room idea where you wander about a 2d space and

498
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,440
 you can talk through your microphone and people who are closer to you can hear what you're saying

499
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,360
 more clearly and people who are further away hear you less clearly and you can wander around

500
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:35,280
 an actual kind of physical space talking and it replicates a bar in 2d and i am looking for the

501
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,200
 link and the name of this and i cannot find it it's very frustrating uh if i do find i'll put a link

502
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:48,320
 in the show notes um but so they've got to get there's a problem with all of these systems at the

503
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:54,720
 moment is that they have to get over the the level of adequacy that we've established now with

504
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,800
 with the zoom in the break out which is clearly not that adequate but it's still

505
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:05,280
 a lot better than a lot of these systems are quite managing yet and the other thing about the

506
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,800
 VR rig that i was going to say is that although my house is not small really it's got five adults

507
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:19,440
 in it and i've been and i don't think of myself as the world's greatest introvert but when i put

508
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:26,000
 on we don't think of the quest introvert either no you're a terrible introvert Alison yeah indeed

509
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,160
 but when i put the quest on i'm alone in a way that i never am in my own house at the moment and i

510
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:42,800
 quite like that it's quite isolating and i have been missing feeling as odd in a type of self-isolation

511
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:52,320
 i have been missing feeling actual time alone to do things i want to do in comfortable spaces because

512
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,720
 my house is not so i've made that many comfortable spaces and they're awful at the name of the service

513
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:03,680
 i was thinking of is Calla and i will put a link in the show notes it is C-A-L-L-A is this a thing

514
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:10,720
 you're planning to use on your virtual guff trip Alison i am hoping that i will be able to do some

515
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:22,000
 of my tours virtually i have a really whizzy idea that i am going to do VR stuff whilst streaming

516
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,520
 whilst streaming it to twitch streaming both the VR stuff and me using using twitch streaming tools

517
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,000
 which i already use a little bit and so that people will be able to come along and watch me

518
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:38,080
 swimming swim off the great barrier reefing real time or something and that will be hilarious

519
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:48,960
 please get in touch for recommendations for ways we can support and learn about the black

520
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,800
 lives matter movement and also b-a-m-e people in the UK and in the community in the UK in general

521
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,360
 and please also write in with your experiences of virtual conventions we would love to hear from

522
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:06,640
 you thank you to Stow shirts for supporting our podcast this week that was the seventh episode

523
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:13,120
 of the octa thought podcast so it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

524
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:19,120
 the theme music for this episode was fanfare for space by kevin mccloud at incompatec.com

525
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:29,200
 used under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license

526
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:37,920
 is this the point where i can say that lillian and christina are hoping to do a podcast and

527
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,160
 when they first told me about this or rather when lillian first told me about this i said

528
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:48,800
 but you'll have to find someone to do all the work and they have now found in sorenson i believe

529
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:54,560
 so he is investigating other podcasts which is how he's paying attention to john's microphone

530
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:00,160
 so i'm very much looking forward i am waiting with baited breath for that podcast to appear

531
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:07,360
 in my podcast feed i will be listening avidly yes no no pressure obviously the fact that we've

532
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:13,360
 announced it doesn't have any ramifications for whether it has to happen uh and allison's decision

533
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:26,000
 to do that was entirely her own uh well i mean i think you know one of the things i always liked

534
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,800
 about fanzines back in the day was that they could be relentless pis takes you know a little bit

535
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,320
 edgy about the the community and the things the community we're getting up to

536
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,600
 and i feel like we should capture some of that flavor in apocos

537
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:50,720
 more antagonism um i do feel if i was going to pick some adjectives to describe our podcast

538
00:54:50,720 --> 00:55:00,960
 edgy would be quite a long way down the list oh okay now i maybe don't mean edgy are you

539
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,200
 are you indicating that you think three middle class white people during a podcast are not at the

540
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,800
 forefront of edge we talk about things we like liz what could be more edgy than this

541
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,560
 my 19 year old son did call me an edgelord this week

542
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:26,960
 right well we're going to come back to that later 100 and i was like what do you mean by edgelord

543
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,760
 dear and he explained and i said and i said you mean like kylo ren and he said yes oh dear

544
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:40,800
 oh allison i i i said that that's that's unfair i said what i actually said was that's unfair

545
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,400
 quash quash quash quash quash quash quash quash quash but we'll come back to that

546
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,080
 i would like to reassure people that allison was miming uh destroying a control console with a

547
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:56,640
 lightsaber and not miming beating her children uh that's important to note the context of the video

548
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:03,280
 was uh key in that particular direction um before we descend the noise is a terrible

549
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,880
 yeah everyone knows it goes warm exactly
