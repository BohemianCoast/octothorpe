 Hello everyone and welcome to the 91st episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for Science Fiction

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,680
 and Science Fiction Founder which is coming to you on the 31st of August, 2023. I'm John

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:33,560
 Coxin. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. And we have some letters of comment for you

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:41,360
 all. We got some letters of comment. First off we got letters about, oh no yeah we got

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,360
 letters from Chris Garcia and Abigail and it turns out that Chris Garcia and Abigail

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,600
 Nussbaum are going to have to have a cage fight. Oh that sounds good. This is news to

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,680
 both of them. But we basically got various letters about AI. Thank you everyone who wrote

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,080
 in about that. Chris says he's looking forward to Asteroid C and Abigail said that Liz would

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,360
 not succeed in baiting her with praise for the last blade priest. So your attempt to

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:17,400
 hook an Abigail has failed Liz. Well has it failed or did she write a letter? See because

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,680
 I was like it's a bold move to put a PS about not being baited at the start of the successful

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:32,120
 reeling in. I think it is a bold move. I think Liz has caught and that's a fishing trip that's

14
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,480
 gone well for you Liz. Yeah to be fair to Abigail she has read other things on the kitschy's

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,960
 red tentacle shortlist and I have not so I can't say if they're better and for I know they may

16
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,520
 well they may well be better but I still enjoyed it so they're... She also explains that sub-length

17
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,240
 that I was being to one note about Luddites. So I think when I talk about Luddites I do know

18
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,040
 something of the history so I was including the fact that the Luddites weren't totally

19
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,440
 daft about their protests. It was it was reasonable. I still think they're wrong and Abigail thinks

20
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,400
 they're totally reasonable which is fine. I think we can we can have differing opinions.

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,280
 Laurie Anderson also says "Hugok to Thorpe girl" so that's good. Liz has done a thumbs up and a

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,840
 triumphant facial expression Laurie so um... I mean I can't hug them because on the other side

23
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,520
 of the planet but you know metaphorically. Yes. I still haven't got over the fact that she's

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,640
 Laurie Anderson. I just want to go oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh every time. I assume that's referencing

25
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,440
 something I am too young to know about. Yeah yeah it's a superman. I see.

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,000
 Alison will provide links for the show notes. No I found a link that's actually uh huh huh.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,120
 Well there's there's a joke for all of our older listeners. We have plenty of older listeners.

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,440
 I'm gonna clip I'm gonna clip that out. That might be a useful thing to have all the self-force.

29
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,120
 Just it might be useful if I have a button that I compressed that just says in Liz's voice there's

30
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,800
 a joke for our older listeners. I can be useful at conventions. Okay guys look you don't have to

31
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:21,640
 remind me of my impending senility all of the time. What we've done here listeners is we've kept

32
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:30,280
 strictly on topic and we've not digressed so that's good. Right then we did get letters about

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,640
 six wakes. We heard from Christopher J Garcia. We heard from Laurie Anderson. We heard from

34
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,320
 Edward Moreland and then we heard from Ali Brooke, Ali Baker Brooks and David Curry about

35
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,400
 problems they have with the representation of their expertise in culture. So yes I think it's fair

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,640
 to say that some people like the book and some people didn't. You've just summarized the whole

37
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,760
 episode, child. Why are you gonna be bothered by this? But I did hear from at least two people who did

38
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,240
 who had not read the book, who did then really enjoy it. So I was glad because even if you read

39
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,400
 it and you hated it I'm very sorry to you but if you read it and you loved it, hooray hello.

40
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,840
 Yeah Emily January really liked it so that was she read it because of our episode and she really

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,200
 liked it and I was like *sigh* and also having just finished the spare man this is a spoiler for

42
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,920
 a Hugo episode. I actually need to make this joke in the Hugo episode which is I think I may just

43
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,520
 not like books with food bridges in them. Fair enough. Fair enough.

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:41,720
 Shall we talk about the Clark Award? Yes, we can talk about the Clark Award.

45
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,960
 On the topic of books, so the Clark Award was awarded.

46
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,080
 Liz do you want to tell us about this? So the Clark Award was awarded this year

47
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,360
 in a nice ceremony that I did not attend that was in the UK. Do we want to explain what the

48
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,760
 Clark Award is for our new reviewers? New listeners. Oh I suppose I could do that. So

49
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,480
 the Arthsee Clark Award is an award for the best science fiction novel first published in the UK.

50
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:19,160
 It's been running for, ooh I don't know how long it's been for now since about 1987 I think

51
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,040
 and it's a Judgement Award, a jury award, so there's a jury which is made up of judges from the British

52
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,200
 Science Fiction Association, the Science Fiction Foundation and currently the Sci-Fi London Film

53
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,480
 Festival. And so these judges read nearly every single science fiction novel published in the UK

54
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,480
 in a year. They do have to be submitted so of course for publishers who don't submit them but

55
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,280
 generally they're getting a submission list of kind of up to 100 books and then they pick a

56
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,160
 shortlist of six and then they get together and pick a winner. And the winner is, it has been

57
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,760
 announced previously I think earlier in the year kind of in May or June when that was when the

58
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,280
 Sci-Fi London Film Festival was but this year it was announced in August and the winner was

59
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:09,080
 Venomous Slump Soccer by Ned Bowman as I believe mentioned by John as his sort of stealth pick on

60
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,080
 a previous episode. But as it happens I managed to read all of the Clark shortlist before although I

61
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,600
 did not read every single one of them before the award was announced I fell slightly short.

62
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,520
 Were you on a long intercontinental holiday involving a lot of reading Liz?

63
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,880
 I did go on a long intercontinental holiday involving a lot of reading which is why I've read

64
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,360
 about 20 books since our last episode so I've got lots of material for picks now really maybe for

65
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,080
 the rest of the year. And so I did read I think I read three or four of them while on that holiday

66
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,600
 which was very nice thank you to Neil Harrison who lent me all of those and then I read the other

67
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,160
 two myself and yeah I would. So the Clark award always comes up with a shortlist where I don't know

68
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,920
 it's interesting because there's usually some overlap with other awards but quite often there

69
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,440
 will be kind of some left field books quite often ones that were published by more literary

70
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,320
 publishers or not marketed as science fiction quite often something completely out of left field

71
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,320
 where I have no idea at all why that book has been nominated. Sometimes it's quite fun because you do

72
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,920
 know who the judges are and then you can you know try and wonder what they saw in a book you think

73
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,080
 was terrible but I think it usually picks a pretty good book as the winner. And this year I would

74
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,440
 agree I really liked Venomous Lumpsucker by Ned Bowman which is about you know the the titular

75
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,280
 Venomous Lumpsuckers are a type of fish which you know being studied and maybe more intelligent

76
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,360
 than previously thought and this is a big thing because we are in this sort of climate change dystopia

77
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,400
 where part of the economy now involves extinction credits and you know paying if you drive a species

78
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,920
 extinct and kind of the whole market that would just horribly inevitably spring up around this

79
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,360
 like okay so if I was predicted to make 15 species extinct but actually only made 10 extinct do I

80
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,600
 now get some some tax credits back for not making them extinct. How do we incentivize companies and

81
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,280
 nations not to top down forests? The price of these extinction credits fluctuates which means

82
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,560
 there's a kind of really comedy segment where they go to a place where the last known example of a

83
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,760
 species is being kept and when the extinction credits weren't worth very much known was really

84
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,520
 paying very much attention to it because they didn't get very much money for keeping them alive and

85
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,360
 now extinction credits have become extremely expensive and so they're all like yeah we're going to get

86
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,240
 lots more money but oh wait some of those species maybe are not quite as alive as we hoped and we

87
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:41,080
 thought no one was checking. It's basically a kind of funny dystopian counterpart to I would say to

88
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,800
 Kim Stanley Robinson's Ministry for the future because they're which can kind of posit a sort of you

89
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,760
 know different credit system and incentives and things and have them work as intended this is like

90
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,200
 how you get all the credits and systems and have them work in a kind of the way you can imagine they

91
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,120
 might do under a current capitalist system. So I really enjoyed it. Don did not like it as much

92
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,320
 think sorry Dom. My reaction to this is actually very similar to Liz's reaction to six weeks where

93
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,280
 I liked the ideas and I thought the execution was quite poor. I think my main problem with it is it's

94
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,560
 a book that posits that the UK is completely irrelevant and yet the entire world knows the UK

95
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,080
 by a special name and the UK turns out to be pivotal to the plot and it's like you've got a pick one

96
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,080
 either we're special or we're not but he kind of has his cake and eats it there. We've been not

97
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,400
 doing that for a long time. No I know and I'm like you can't criticize British exceptionalism

98
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,600
 while also practicing British exceptionalism that doesn't land for me which I found very frustrating

99
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,280
 I'm a bit worried at one because I thought it was okay and I'm a bit worried I'm gonna like all

100
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,080
 the others even less. I haven't read the others yet so we'll see. You have read at least one of

101
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,520
 them right? Yeah I like the anomaly a lot. I understand why it didn't win but I like the fact it doesn't

102
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,760
 commit to an interpretation. It's a very it's on the very literary end of science fiction I think

103
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,640
 in that it is much more idea interested in the ideas than the mechanics of the ideas but also

104
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,920
 it's a what they called the oh oh hang on if I go to the anomaly to Wikipedia page it will tell me.

105
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,840
 From there a Lupien work which is one where you basically firstly it's very French and secondly

106
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:33,800
 it's one where you like adopt faux constraints on your writing as your writing and so like it is

107
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,440
 also a literary experiment which I could see some people might have gone with. This is the same

108
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,640
 group that like writes books in palindrones or without using the letter E or stuff like that

109
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,640
 but I haven't read the others. I've heard mixed reports. I'm looking forward to the coral bones

110
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,440
 because I've heard good things about that. I believe that one of the things about the way that the

111
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,880
 Clark Award is structured is that the judges always come from very different perspectives so

112
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:10,920
 judges meetings are allegedly extremely angry but kind of they've got a lot of they've got a

113
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,440
 they're not angry they're just disappointed. They're disappointed. I think that's individual

114
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,880
 judges are in fact disappointed because they come in going one of these books is much better

115
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,600
 than all of the others and then and then it turns out that all of the judges believe that but they

116
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,200
 are picking different horses. Yeah I mean I enjoyed the anomaly but it is basically like a sort of

117
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,880
 I like its sort of character extrapolation stuff of what would actually be the effect on people if

118
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,280
 a certain thing happened but it's science fiction feels like it's got the middle bit where it sort

119
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,240
 of lays out a bunch of potential science fiction like explanations for why a particular thing has

120
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,000
 happened that just feels like a big info dump in the middle of the novel in a way which I wasn't

121
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,560
 very interested in. It has the same problem as six weeks that Edward Moreland was annoyed by

122
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,880
 which is the other problem it has is that all of the people from the religions basically agree

123
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,200
 and Edward Moreland says that he feels that this is unrealistic. I think it is but I think that I

124
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,840
 feel part of the problem there is if you try to do a realistic take-off all the religions would do

125
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:24,040
 in reaction to certain very difficult uh ecumenical questions that that would be and you'd end up

126
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:31,240
 wearing a 26 novel epic it's a lot to grapple with I could understand why authors don't like doing so

127
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,360
 but yeah I mean you're going for plausibility here that they have managed to kind of pick a

128
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,680
 representative per religion which would probably be a whole novel in itself of like who would you

129
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,080
 pick as a representative for each world religion. It especially has like as someone who grew up in

130
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,280
 the church of England like you can't even there's not I mean there's not even just two different

131
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,680
 groups in the church of England with opinions like it's fractal right there's disagreements all

132
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:03,320
 the way down. I think that's all true about the anomaly but I think I liked it better than Venomous

133
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:09,960
 Lumpsucker but I still didn't think it was great I thought it was solid. I think that's my main

134
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,960
 the 2022 list has so many books that I thought were great on it and the 2023 list is like oh

135
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,240
 I was excited and now I'm not so I don't know we'll see maybe after I've read the bar I have a

136
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,440
 different opinion. So I would say they break down into the three that I would recommend you read in

137
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,040
 this three where I'd say you probably don't need to bother or I was less excited by them and

138
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,560
 the anomaly is one of the three I enjoyed along with Venomous Lumpsucker and The Coral Bones by E.J.

139
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,720
 Swift and then the other three the Red Skullers Wake by Alette Bodard I already talked about a

140
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,840
 few episodes to go there's Plutishine by Lucy Hissick and also Imagine on by Tom Watson and I

141
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,880
 would say they're all kind of flawed in one way or another and I would have been a little

142
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,080
 disappointed if any of them had one but they didn't so I'm pretty happy with that. I think we

143
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,640
 talked about Plutishine at all we talked about Plutishine before I'm surprised it was on the

144
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,360
 shortlist and I would have been quite a stylish difficult one it would be a remarkable departure

145
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,400
 for the Clark Award judges if it had won. It is interesting because the 2022 shortlist had

146
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,640
 two I detested and three I loved and one I thought was okay but I understood why it was the winner

147
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,760
 but this one just seemed to be much more it seems to be in many ways a much safer shortlist

148
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,840
 I don't think there's anything I will truly detest and I don't think there's anything that

149
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,480
 will completely capture me it seemed to be much more kind of regression to the meme

150
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,000
 than previous ones and I don't know whether that says something about 2023 or 2022 as a year for

151
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,800
 the genre because the other thing is the I mean spoilers for our Hugo book discussion episode

152
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,720
 listeners but I think the same could be argued of the Hugo finalists this year as well where I don't

153
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,400
 think there's one that really astounded me. A lot of people are saying a lot of people are saying

154
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,640
 gosh isn't it a week year for the Hugo shortlist we are if we conclude that we will not be alone

155
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,360
 in our thoughts but I've only read two of them so far but I've read two of them that's amazing

156
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,120
 yeah no well done well done and the one that I've seen a lot of people say should have been on

157
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,400
 these shortlists was the moon day letters which as we previously discussed I liked a lot but I

158
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,760
 thought it had flaws I don't think I've read any books that I would give five out of five on good

159
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:28,440
 reads from 2022 yet maybe there's one lurking I just haven't heard about Sea of Tranquility by

160
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,560
 Emily Cindre-Mantle oh yeah I haven't read that one yet it is on my it is on my radar as is

161
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,240
 I don't give book star ratings really because I kind of think well a lot of books are just kind

162
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,960
 of not not a book that's being written for somebody like me but um Sea of Tranquility is

163
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,640
 absolutely a book that's being written for people like me and if I gave star ratings I'd

164
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,600
 give it a five stars because it's short and thoughtful the other one that I'm looking forward to reading

165
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,840
 which I think I will love is the spear cuts through water which I have not yet read yeah you'd love

166
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,720
 the Vanish birds I did love the Vanish birds but it was very good people say the spear cuts through

167
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,600
 water is better than the Vanish birds I have not read either anyway books in it but I'm glad you

168
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,160
 liked I'm glad you liked the numerous love sucker Liz I um yes hoorah and I would just say yes the

169
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,120
 final the final book that we because we haven't mentioned it on this podcast at all yet is metronome

170
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,400
 by Tom Watson which is very much your literary science fiction pick but two people who have committed

171
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:32,920
 some mysterious crime and their sentence is to live alone on an island or is it and every day

172
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,480
 they must take pills that get spent three times a day to keep them alive basically and it's about

173
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,080
 what happens when they come up to supposedly the end of their sentence and relief does not arrive

174
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:50,520
 and you learn more about their backstory and why they're on the island and it's fine it just feels

175
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:58,120
 a bit like not very new not to spoil too much but it does turn into a fairly standard dystopian

176
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,360
 reason for why these two have been exiled to an island and then it all goes a bit off the rails

177
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,400
 at the end I wouldn't recommend seeking out unless you're being a clerk shortlist completist this year

178
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:23,960
 and then on the topic of awards the Hugo voter packet has been released yes so a lot of people

179
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,320
 said that they were having a lot of trouble downloading and that was because

180
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:34,440
 Chengdu hadn't sorted its certificates out but they have sorted that all out now and I found it

181
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,960
 straightforward to download some of the downloads are huge and I'm you know I always cut slack to

182
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,840
 the best graphic story category because if you significantly reduce the size of those files then

183
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:55,400
 you also reduce the quality of the past probably what people really want but there's two enormous

184
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,520
 files one of which is I think the episode of the expanse that has been this is a finalist has

185
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,560
 been included in full but I wouldn't recommend anybody watch that if they haven't watched the

186
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,240
 previous 197 episodes of the expanse or how many have ever been in the hour so I'm not sure what

187
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:21,480
 used the two and a half gigabytes there is for you but in best related work there's a four gigabyte

188
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,600
 download that is the uncompressed audiobook of Terry Pratchett A Life with Footnotes by Rob

189
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,200
 Wilkins it's narrated by Rob Wilkins and it's lovely to have it in the packet I think that might be a

190
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,480
 first supply the audiobook edition as well as the print versions love it but they could probably

191
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:45,960
 have compressed that uncompressed audio is quite big yeah yeah I can see so I can see what they're

192
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,360
 going for so I would say also I had a problem downloading the packet at the start because the

193
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,280
 links would not automatically open when you clicked on them you had to basically go and open them in

194
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:01,640
 a new tab because the HTTP HTTPS was messed up but I also had some very slow downloads and I'm not

195
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,760
 sure why but it meant I actually haven't downloaded best related work yet because

196
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,720
 I know it's going to be a slow download and I don't listen to audiobooks so I am thinking look in

197
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,120
 future if you're going to have like anything which is or maybe over gig for a certain thing

198
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,440
 then make it optional I don't need two and a half gigs of the expanse it's very nice but I've

199
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,160
 seen it I don't need no new book I'm never going to listen to and it'd be fine if they were you

200
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,960
 know hosted somewhere incredibly fast like previous ones I think have been hosted on Amazon's like

201
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,240
 hosting system and I've been very quick to download but these were quite slow and so I don't

202
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,960
 want to just sort of sit there downloading a bunch of files I don't need also all the downloads are

203
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,520
 called Hugo packet so I have like Hugo packet folders one through 20 or something but on the

204
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:52,920
 contents of the Hugo packet I can link to it but um our occasional correspondent

205
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,200
 uh a Sats Culture has put together a page which tells you what is in the voter pack

206
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,960
 for all the fiction categories so not for every category but I think just for

207
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,360
 the fiction and some of and I think that's dramatic or is it or it might be everything it

208
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,600
 might be everything but it basically tells you what you get in there is it a partial version a

209
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:17,000
 complete version pdf e-pub what language is it in and then a few notes and that is quite useful to

210
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,200
 see what has been what has been presented in every category you can see that basically you get

211
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,880
 complete versions of all the novels but only if you go to netgalley and request one of them and

212
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,280
 also some of them are only in pdf and not e-pub which is a tiny bit annoying to me because I

213
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,280
 would much rather read things in e-pub and I can't think it is that beneficial to stop piracy to

214
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,800
 give me a complete book in pdf but only part of it in e-pub so it seems a bit strange I don't

215
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,640
 understand the logic where you put it in pdf and not in e-pub I can understand the logic of not

216
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,120
 providing it because you think some of the Hugo electorate might buy it and I guess by putting it

217
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,000
 in pdf and not e-pub you think that people who are annoyed enough by pdfs will buy the e-pub instead

218
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,560
 but like it just seems very strange to me I don't I really understand the logic and if it is piracy

219
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,160
 based that makes even less sense to me because they must be aware these books were already out there

220
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,800
 they're out there as soon as they're published like the Hugo's is not how these works are making

221
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,720
 it into into the seven seas I mean I would buy the e-book if I thought they were books that if

222
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,640
 they were books I would otherwise gonna probably buy anyway then I would go and buy the e-pub but

223
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,880
 I think they might be books which I may not otherwise have bought so I'm not going to go straight

224
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,080
 out there and buy the e-pubs when I can I can read the pdfs I just prefer to have them in e-pub

225
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,440
 so they can go on my e-reader that's exactly it right like I'm gonna read the e-pub I'm gonna read

226
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,640
 the pdf and be grumpy I'm not gonna spend money I'm just gonna be grumpy and that seems like the

227
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,200
 the weirds you shouldn't want me to be grumpy whatever you read your book I will get it some of

228
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,960
 the books you get to the long end of the long extracts and it says do ask for the whole of this

229
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,480
 book on netgalley and I have asked for some of these and I have not yet been sent any this is one of

230
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,840
 these when I was doing the Hugo packet thing one of the reasons we just like netgalley is that there's

231
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:15,080
 a kind of secret if you are in the US caveat to netgalley because mostly if people are not in the US

232
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:22,200
 the publishers will not give it to you so so you're disenfranchising your non-us photos I don't

233
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,520
 I mean I don't like netgalley very much so I don't too much mind the netgalley thing I think the problem

234
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,920
 with the netgalley thing is that you can't just log in and make an account now you have to make

235
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,560
 an account and fill in your whole profile and say whether you're like a reviewer or what and put

236
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:43,000
 in like the website where you post your reviews like you can't just sign up as a Hugo voter who is

237
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,440
 interested in only getting Hugo voter packet things you have to sign up like as a full member

238
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,360
 to get it and I did get the one I requested but like it's just quite a lot of extra faff because I

239
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:01,400
 had to basically log in and say oh well I'm a I'm a podcaster and I might podcast it we do in fact

240
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,160
 talk about books on our Hugo finalist podcast now so if anyone would like to send me books please

241
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,640
 feel free but that's kind of what annoys me about the netgalley thing which is they're like

242
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,520
 requests us on that galley and it's like but how if you're just someone who is a Hugo voter and does

243
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,320
 not have a broadcast and does not like have a blog where they talk about the books they read

244
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,560
 I don't get the impression you're likely to be accepted so they're basically saying if you're

245
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,920
 an important member of the community click this button and we'll give it to you but if you're one

246
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,320
 of the plebs you can't have it sorry and I'm like the whole point of the Hugo voter packet is it's

247
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,840
 good because all the voters get the packet and so I would rather it didn't have this bifurcation

248
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,240
 so when we did the packet we basically if people said oh they can ask for netgalley we were like

249
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,480
 well you're gonna get up to everyone right and they were like absolutely oh that's good when people

250
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,160
 wrote to us and said this has not come through from netgalley which wasn't variably because they

251
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,480
 worded to the US we would write back to the publishers and say right you're gonna send him a deep

252
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,600
 pub then here's their email address and and I did quite a lot of because one of the reasons that the

253
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,960
 Hugo voter packet was a ton of work was that we did quite a lot of managing round the edges

254
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,400
 through the Hugo packet help the other thing we did was stick um whatever they ended up download

255
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,200
 was over a gigabyte we just stuck it on a streaming site and pointed people at it we're not gonna we

256
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,480
 we didn't let people download 4 gigabytes of you know expanse episode I mean I I know that I think

257
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,360
 the download should be optional but as someone who always downloads all of the massive things um

258
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,520
 I'm quite glad that they uh they are there because I like downloading them so just to say

259
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,920
 some of the other things so Vincent Best Novella is there entirely an e-pub which is nice and

260
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:51,480
 therefore I'll probably read that entire category quite excited by that um one story in Best Novelette

261
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:59,640
 has a full Chinese translation one novelt that is uh was in the Chinese languages only available

262
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:06,200
 in in Chinese unfortunately so that's a bit of a shame but in Best Nove's short story it looks like

263
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,120
 five out of the six nominees are available in both languages which is very nice so actually

264
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,480
 this is this is gonna be really nice I was worried that I would not be able to have any

265
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,760
 opinions on some of these categories because of stories I couldn't get to but actually I will

266
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,240
 be able to read most of the nominees in these categories I think it's worth saying I think

267
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:30,280
 for once in future the graphic story where volume four has been nominated I think the entire work

268
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,320
 is in there and I read the first two volumes while on holiday and pretty enjoyed it so now I'm

269
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,400
 gonna read the benefits that he goes and read all the rest everything else in graphic story

270
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,200
 seems to be there completely best related work there's a bunch of stuff I guess the only one

271
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,840
 where it might be hard to judge is Best Series you get complete works for two of them and for three

272
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,360
 of them you have to try and request copies on net galley and for one of them you there are any net

273
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,840
 galley requests links so it'll be interesting to see if that has any well I bet we can't really

274
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,440
 tell if that has any effect on the voting but I think that is very nice particularly as tiny

275
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,320
 spoilers for our Hugo episode but I read uh terms and mirrors known of the ninth and if you have

276
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,240
 not read Gideon the ninth and Harrow the ninth I think you will be completely confused by

277
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,160
 Nona the ninth so that's going to be an interesting one does having all the material you need in the

278
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,920
 Best Series packet help you in best novel if your novel is quite a difficult entry point

279
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:32,280
 John have you read Gideon the ninth and Harrow the ninth yes obviously uh brilliant um

280
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,640
 I'm sorry you could be a guinea pig I want someone who hasn't read him to read Nona

281
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,560
 it's time for our new segment which is called what does my wife think about the state of the field

282
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:48,520
 of science fiction da da da da da hey jingle it's basically it's fanny was going to read Nona the ninth

283
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,080
 because she was very unconvinced by Harrow uh she I think she quite liked Gideon but she did not

284
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,720
 really get on with Harrow she went to download Nona the ninth and then she read in the thing this

285
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,960
 is the third book in the four book series and she was like no this is not what Best Novel is for this

286
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,880
 is why we gave you lot Best Series push off with your series is and this triggered a run and that

287
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,840
 made me laugh quite a lot yeah I don't know I don't think Nona Nona didn't I just want half an

288
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,160
 hour of his spanias opinions can we just have you recording episode with a spaniel one day

289
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,920
 what spaniel thinks about the state of science fiction I think it would be fun yes I only report

290
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,520
 the things that I think that will make you laugh there are things that would make you argue with

291
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,760
 her and that's where the problem would arise so one of the things that's interesting about the

292
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,680
 voter packet is that it's not complete and for example best fan scene where people did submit

293
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:43,320
 uploads to it has not appeared in the packet and there may be more but I'm not sure so it seems

294
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,360
 quite strange to me that it's complete in most areas but not in others did one of you just say

295
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,560
 there's the whole rivers of London nine books as long as you like PDFs yeah that's what I said

296
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:01,400
 I am I'm on net galley as we speak uh which is bad form I know I shouldn't do these things

297
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:08,280
 but uh I am doing so you know there's that and I am requesting the books but I had to update my

298
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,200
 account so I created it before you needed to give them loads of information but they have

299
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,800
 basically when you log in they're like oh you have to give us all the information so I am now

300
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:26,840
 listed as john c/media-comer-journalist which is ludicrous yeah I'm a serious book reviewer

301
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:33,320
 there's no option for I just quite like books I think that's what makes me I think that

302
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:40,200
 what makes me a little bit sneer about using net galley which is you shouldn't need to be

303
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,360
 anything other than someone who quite likes books to engage with the Hugo voting you should not

304
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,440
 need to have an outlet I should not need to give a URL of where I am going to discuss this book

305
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,240
 and I understand why net galley does that because it is a book for reviewers to ask for copies of

306
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,760
 review books but that is not what the Hugo's there's no there's no implication of a quid pro

307
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,640
 pro of like I will read this and might review it in the Hugo packet you read it and might vote for

308
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,160
 it so like put it in or don't put it in but the net galley thing is daft imho I'm feeling very

309
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:18,520
 punchy today sorry I'm very opinionated I mean it's a net galley thing because they can

310
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:24,440
 do one of those like watermarked e-pubs that has all my details in or something

311
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,040
 I haven't actually opened my net galley one yet but if they did that I guess that would kind of make

312
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,480
 sense right like if you buy books or for so books then they're all DRM free and they email them to

313
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,000
 you if you go to request short and requires books on net galley you can just download them you

314
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,600
 don't actually have to request them they're just there so like if you have been thinking about

315
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,480
 reading those they just have a read it link rather than a request access link um so that that and that

316
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,560
 I think is that I'm fine with is the requesting bit that I find odd I haven't read those and I

317
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,920
 think they're the only ones in best series I haven't read hmm maybe I read one or two Rosemary

318
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,160
 room is fine it doesn't take long and it's not like it's not so terrible you throw it across a room

319
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,920
 but equally I don't think it's good enough to merit winning an award

320
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:20,760
 site selection uh Liz has written in the show notes

321
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,280
 site selection voting has started if you can manage it Liz do you want to talk about that

322
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,960
 well I I have not personally tried to vote in site selection because there's only one bid this

323
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,640
 year so it's not like they need my vote especially and it seemed like quite a lot of hassle because

324
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,160
 all the emails like went into my spam folder I basically interactions with the Chengdu website

325
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,280
 are basically oh yeah I'll do them if I have to but they're normally like oh maybe the certificate's

326
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:55,160
 broken or or maybe this page isn't load or oh maybe I can get a reset email for my password but I

327
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,040
 can never actually manage to log in in the time the password reset email is actually valid um you

328
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,120
 know basically it's with a hassle and so I haven't voted in site selection because

329
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:14,680
 I can't build it but there is one bid it is for Seattle a place I have never been but sounds

330
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:24,360
 quite nice Seattle's amazing um it would be in the brand new expansion to the conference center

331
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,560
 in downtown Seattle it hasn't been settled since 1961 it seems like a pretty good bid for a world

332
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,880
 con and a pretty interesting place to have a world con and they've got a fun logo which is

333
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,840
 presumably as close as you can get to the Starbucks logo without getting sued what a look good on

334
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,000
 t-shirts and so you can now vote for it and I also got some emails which said that there would be

335
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,200
 like a Q&A session with the Seattle bid unfortunately this Q&A session was held yesterday and I

336
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,160
 fished the emails out of my spam bucket this morning but it's the thought that counts right

337
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,960
 it's just changing the end of the problem right this is a perfectly reasonable email

338
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,680
 but the problem is that the registration link obviously goes through doesn't go straight to

339
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,920
 a zoom page something it goes to some kind of like link thing through their email which

340
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,840
 presume you used for nefarious purposes and so Google thinks all of them are trying to steal my

341
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,320
 information and so they always end up in spam and I just don't regularly tip my spam enough

342
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,120
 so I'm very glad it's not a contested bid actually because I think it was a contested bid and people

343
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:30,760
 were having lots of problems logging in and lots of problems paying I think you can only pay using

344
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,720
 credit card not like buy check or cash this year but I can't be long let me just check that one

345
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,880
 I think this is 2023 right it is 2023 but potentially people don't want to give their credit card

346
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,840
 details to a Chinese welcome yes so buy yourself a throw away prepayment card and use that yeah

347
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:58,120
 probably but I mean I've never tried doing that in the US and I don't know who easy is and okay

348
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,880
 bit it's a bit different because you've always been able to like hand carry a ballot with some

349
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,520
 dollars in it basically if you really wanted to and that year that's not going to be an option

350
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:12,040
 yeah and I think like yeah probably yeah you could say okay we're not going to take any cash

351
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,640
 or checks for site selection like I think if Glasgow wanted to say now we are not taking cash

352
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,200
 or checks for site selection you have to manage to pay through our online system or at the comm

353
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,880
 could announce it now but maybe you need to announce that one a little bit in advance for those people

354
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,800
 who don't have credit cards or don't wish to get a credit card but I mean then they get a friend

355
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,800
 to pay for them and pay them back presumably there are ways around it and I'm sure they will

356
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,160
 figure them out so I guess it's good it's not in a contested bid year but I have not joined it

357
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,800
 I'll join Seattle when they actually become the seated bid

358
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:48,920
 [Music]

359
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,560
 I need to before I go on my guff trip spoiler for the next section I am going to get a bra

360
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,320
 that contains no wire oh yeah get one for traveling you need a wire free bra anyway

361
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,320
 it was a pandemic yeah obviously I don't know why I hadn't worked this out before

362
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,600
 I just like people feeling my tits in public on the subject of Alison's tits let's talk about

363
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:14,680
 guff what's your guff plans Alison so yes it's happening it's really it's really really

364
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,560
 really happening now I have booked almost all of my flights I've booked almost all of my accommodation

365
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,200
 though it's all the accommodation is cancelable so if fans come out of the woodwork in the places

366
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,960
 where we've where I've ended up booking hotels and say no no no I can put you up do not do not stay

367
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:36,600
 in a hotel there then booked a very exciting train up the east coast of the south island of New

368
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,560
 Zealand and I've booked a very exciting ferry across the cook straight which is supposed to be the

369
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,520
 best beautiful ferry journey in the world or my New Zealand friends say when the weather is good

370
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,680
 which is apparently a bit random but you know I used to live in Scotland I understand this

371
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,600
 I have lots of plans to meet up with people if you are in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra or if you're

372
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:03,320
 going to Conflux which is the Australian netcon Adelaide, Christchurch, Picton or Nelson which is

373
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,000
 quite near Picton Wellington Auckland or Perth get in touch I mean not if you're already in touch

374
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,600
 because obviously a lot of these things are already sorted but I'll be in all of those places and in

375
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,800
 most cases I'll be in those places for long enough that I can be fairly flexible about when I meet up

376
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,880
 and I'm very excited by all of this and I've got like side trips and where there's one side trip I

377
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,120
 don't want to talk about because it's so exciting that if it happens I'll be like oh I can talk about

378
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:35,240
 it out and I'll go to islands and I'm going to tourist places and I'm going to Faddish

379
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,360
 Haultsard I'm going to hear Justin Accroyd singing Acapella music with men

380
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:50,760
 and wow it's just amazing it's gonna be amazing guys it's also going to be incredibly expensive

381
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,080
 oh I mean I'm sorry for the person who's going to come north in 2024 because

382
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:02,040
 there's going to be any funds so I guess I'm going to have to start fundraising

383
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,240
 massively for that immediately after I get back from the trip

384
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:11,160
 them are them are the rules I mean this is a serious thing I think is that as far as I can tell

385
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:19,560
 flights in the post-COVID flights in this kind of weird semi-post pandemic flights of resumed time

386
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,200
 are drastically more expensive than they were in the pre-pandemic era so just for that

387
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,000
 basically more we're going to need more fundraising for every every fanist trip

388
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,760
 internal flights don't actually seem to have gone up as much as I thought but I think the

389
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:44,440
 actual flight to and from Australia is about it's not quite doubled it's about 80% more than I

390
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,920
 thought I was going to have to pay for that flight well when I ran in 2020 and hence because

391
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,080
 Stephen's coming with me for three weeks his flight is also his flight's not quite as expensive as

392
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,760
 mine because I'm going by one airline to Sydney and I'm coming back by another airline from Perth so

393
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:05,800
 oh yeah that'll get you one of my expensive things about this trip is that it's going to be the

394
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,480
 first time we think that a guff delegate has taken a non-stop flight from Australia to the UK so

395
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,840
 that's quite exciting oh god that's going to be a long flight do you feel do you like long flights

396
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:25,640
 Alison 17 hours 45 minutes I believe that I am going to test whether it's possible for me to sleep

397
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,760
 continuously for 17 hours and 45 minutes and it might be because I mean I kind of look at the

398
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,840
 things I've packed into Perth on the grounds that I can sleep when I'm dead or rather when I'm on

399
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,360
 an aeroplane for 17 hours and 45 minutes I well I hope it I hope it's a very good trip you're going

400
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:47,480
 to need a squishy bra all I can say I am going to get a squishy bra but also I quite good at sleeping

401
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,560
 on Forbes and public transport so I hope it's going to be okay this probably can't go in the

402
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,720
 podcast but one way you could raise funds is by auctioning the squishy bra at the end having

403
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,800
 not washed it that's disgusting and no and also the squishy bra would have been washed on multiple

404
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,960
 occasions during the trip you can't you can't tell me you don't think it might work it could there's

405
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,040
 a chance it would it would work I mean you probably can push to the podcast but though I have never

406
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,480
 I have never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever you know because I do quite a lot of eBay and

407
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,760
 so Alison will you be reporting on your goth trip on you know live journal or twitter or your only

408
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:34,680
 fans I tell you what that is a good way to raise money for the fan funds that is the only fans

409
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:49,000
 with discussion of the exact nature of the squishy bra only fan funds

410
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,720
 so shall we do pics yes we're going to make Alison go first on account of how

411
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:05,080
 she's got another non-Sf no pic it's totally a sf no oh hello oh hello come on now yeah no actually

412
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:12,280
 that's that is fair that is fair all right Alison do your very very relevant pic so so my pic is

413
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:19,880
 several crates of unsorted lego which is where my decluttering has got to and I was like I can

414
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,920
 take these what I should have done was go I have several I found several unsorted crates of lego

415
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,760
 what I should do is put them to us to one side until much later in the decluttering process where I

416
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,800
 could then sort out the lego but in fact I went oh lego let me sort it out this will not take it

417
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,280
 long and I will generate order out of chaos it has it is it is it is one box of lego what

418
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,440
 great lego belonging to one of my offspring one crate of lego belonging to my other offspring

419
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,920
 and two castles which I thought were in two separate crates but appear to be in two crates

420
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,240
 each of which have bits of each castle in it in that helpful way and also a box or a crate of

421
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,880
 bionicle which has never been sorted it was given to us as I was kind of here have a crate of

422
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,320
 totally unsorted bionicle and it has stayed in that way and I thought I would generate order

423
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,840
 out of chaos but in fact what I have done is generate several slightly smaller heaps of chaos

424
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:23,240
 which is not necessarily a good outcome but I have made one of the castles and and I was like

425
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,240
 because it's very straightforward you could buy the bits if there are a few bits missing I will

426
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,360
 sort everything out sort of to two sets work out which bits are missing get all the spare bits

427
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:39,000
 profit and it turns out that one of the bits that's missing from this castle is a piece of

428
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:49,480
 hose lego hose that only existed in this castle yep and somebody in Denmark will sell me for 14

429
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:55,320
 pounds that's not happening so I don't know I'm leaving this as a maybe later maybe it'll be

430
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,480
 somewhere else if I like my child's bedroom but I think what happens is that although we'd be very

431
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,600
 assiduous about not throwing away lego ever a random bit of plastic tube could easily have

432
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:14,440
 got thrown away are you sure that it is hose and it's not hose hose have you considered looking for

433
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:22,920
 any tiny letter o's in lego in your house this foreign listeners is a two ronnie's joke well if

434
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,960
 you cut it very fine with a knife because one of my one of my options for this hose is to get

435
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,120
 the same hose in roughly the same color and a bit longer and chop a bit off the end of it that

436
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,600
 might happen and then when they're like she did this they'll be like there's no proof and they

437
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:45,720
 will direct people to Oxford episode 91 hello future lego police it's good to have you with us

438
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,960
 yeah so of course it is science fiction because the castles are from the 2006 to

439
00:41:51,960 --> 00:42:00,200
 2008 fantasy castle era of of lego which is fantastic the castle I have built is the dwarf's mine

440
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:07,720
 which is way better than any 40 pound lego set has ever been it's wonderful it's got like

441
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,400
 it's got like little tippy crates full of golds that you tip and and many like double-headed

442
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:20,520
 axes and just fantastic stuff Liz you got any lego? I mean not anymore I did have a lot of lego

443
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,680
 I'm not entirely sure whether lego ended up I mean it wouldn't have been thrown away right

444
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:30,680
 because yeah no I mean it'll probably have been donated to some younger children who wanted lego

445
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,720
 I think oh yeah I had tons very organized filing system as well the lego knight's castle

446
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:42,840
 which is the one that like uses all the iconography for when I was a child is 344 pounds 99 yeah it's

447
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:48,680
 about four times the size of the original knight's castle oh yeah but it's also four times the

448
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,120
 and a lot of the new lego they've got a lot of like small little bits but they don't they don't

449
00:42:54,120 --> 00:43:00,120
 necessarily have the stuff that's so you know exciting about the about the dwarf mine the dwarf

450
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,600
 mine's the dwarf mine's an awesome set um it's amazing how much of it is still there actually

451
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,280
 given you know given the fact that it has got things like projectiles sorry Liz I interrupted your

452
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,840
 you're about to tell us all about it's all right no I've got I've got distracted by looking

453
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:21,000
 lego pirate ships now yes this is the way yes so one of the problems of this is that I don't feel

454
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,560
 I don't really want to give children crates of unsorted lego but also my my offspring feel like

455
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,760
 there is probably money in there them their hills and they are probably right even but I'll know

456
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,680
 how much money after I finished all the sort of Liz yes oh do you want my pick or I'm gonna talk

457
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,720
 about lego yes please you want my pick oh okay so I read a lot of books and now I'm like oh which

458
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:50,360
 ones do I want people to to to use my pick I am gonna go with the mountain in the sea by Ray

459
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:57,000
 Naylor which was a Hugo nominee at the time which was a nebula finalist and also one of those

460
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,040
 books where I thought people were thinking it was a nailed on Hugo finalist and it was not

461
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,400
 along with Babel or that was even more nailed on so the mountain in the sea is I believe a

462
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:16,120
 debut novel of Ray Naylor and it is about octopuses yay more specifically it is about it's kind of a

463
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:23,800
 book about kind of the nature of intelligence and what it means to be intelligent and what it means

464
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:31,720
 to be conscious in a sort of near future setting a lot of it is set on these Condal Islands which

465
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:37,080
 are set of islands in Vietnam which have now been kind of cordoned off from the world by a large

466
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:42,120
 tech corporation and the scientists get sent to investigate what is essentially an extremely

467
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:47,720
 intelligent octopus species living down there but there's also kind of the nature of artificial

468
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:54,120
 intelligence of AIs it's near future you've got the hacking of AIs you've got human slavery on these

469
00:44:54,120 --> 00:45:00,520
 giant fishing ships run by AI that are sailing the seas and it's a bit of a slightly dystopian

470
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,800
 future and I quite enjoyed it I think its main floor is it it does feel like someone read a lot of

471
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,640
 books on octopuses and was like yeah octopuses they're super cool I'm gonna write a book about

472
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,800
 super telling octopuses yay and there's a bit much of that and I'm not quite sure it gets the DNA

473
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,240
 and evolution stuff quite right but I mean that is my problem with like all novels with DNA and

474
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,960
 evolution as we've been through on the podcast before but it's good enough and yeah I quite

475
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:33,960
 enjoyed it it's a very good start and I would read more by Raynaylor nice I've not heard of that one

476
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:43,880
 so that is interesting is it as good as Agent Tchaikovsky's book about octopuses um no but it is short

477
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,440
 and standalone intriguing I mean I do like octopuses so you know that could work anyway now that I've

478
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:57,320
 started reading books I have I have um Paul requested it from the library I guess a lot of these books

479
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,600
 are going to come in while I'm in Australia you can always let the lapses expire and then just

480
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:08,920
 re-request them right but yeah but it's 65 pence every time John so you're five pence you

481
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:16,520
 place a hold yeah that's almost when I place a hold for a physical book it's 65 pence online I think

482
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,920
 it would I think it would be free if I place the holds at the library on a book that was in

483
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,160
 Walthon Forest but I never place holds at the library always place holds online because it's

484
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,600
 not really worth 65 p to me to queue up at the library desk and then I should do my pick we're

485
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,400
 in the sequence of the year where almost all of the reading I'm doing is for the Hugo episode

486
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,680
 and so I have no good recommend it like I have nothing to report there really

487
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,600
 realize I picked Lego and I could have picked the world I've left this I've left this for picks

488
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:53,720
 because it's not I guess it's not really directly Oct Thorpe's remit and also I've been accused before

489
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,640
 of wanging on for too long about stuff I've read or played under the guise of not picking so this

490
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:05,560
 time I'm going to do it under the guise of picking them so I have played the Spilled Eora's nominees

491
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:14,920
 for 2023 I have not to be fair this is a slight lie because I have not played fun facts because I

492
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:21,080
 cannot find an implementation of it or a copy of it anywhere I can access it which is like you

493
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:28,280
 know it happens but it is very slightly irritating but I have managed to play the other five so I

494
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:35,400
 don't tend to bother with the Kinder Spilled Eora because that's like for younger games and they're

495
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:43,640
 not usually my speed so I have played challenges and Icky and Planet Unknown and then I've also

496
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:49,400
 played Dothromantic and Next Station London Dothromantic and Next Station London were up for the Spiel

497
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:56,520
 and challenges and Icky and Planet Unknown were up for the Kenna Spiel and I enjoyed all of them

498
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:02,680
 actually so Dothromantic is based on a video game which is out for PC and Switch and I actually

499
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:08,600
 think the board game adaptation is better than the video game because the video game is infinite

500
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:15,560
 and you basically just keep going until you fail but the board game is a bit more structured which

501
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,360
 I like and I kind of hope they will add a mode to the video game which recreates the way the board

502
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,520
 game works because that would be neat I would be interested to play the board game more the

503
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:30,600
 the TTS mode I used to play it does not have the campaign elements in the mod and so I would

504
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,760
 call it go to a board game cafe and see like how it unfolds as you can see to use play

505
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,120
 because I think that might be quite interesting and Next Station London is a lovely little roll

506
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:46,760
 and write it's very vaguely themed around London like almost non-existently but it's got bright

507
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:53,640
 colours and it's about making trains on a little pad so I liked that one quite a lot that's the game

508
00:48:53,640 --> 00:49:00,280
 I played of all the board games I played in 2022 Next Station London is the one I played the most

509
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:07,000
 about 12 times I think it takes about 10 minutes right and you can play five games in a row yep

510
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,600
 now those are both true facts I don't neither of those games would be good enough to end up in

511
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:18,200
 my collection I don't think they're both like probably Dothromantic is probably a six and Next

512
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,160
 Station London is probably a five like I would play Dothromantic again but I can't see myself

513
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,840
 playing it a lot and Next Station London like I'm glad I played it but I probably won't go back

514
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,400
 because it's very light I have better role and write so I think Next Station London's on board

515
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:39,000
 game arena and that's a very good way of playing it I was gonna get to that at the end

516
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,240
 the other three games are played with Challengers Icky and Planet Unknown Icky has a terrible rule

517
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:50,120
 book but the actual game is lovely my friends really disliked the game because of how bad the

518
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,440
 rule book was and this is a salutary lesson in if you are designing a game make sure the rule book

519
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,600
 does not make the game feel like a chore to play because I think the core gameplay loop

520
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:04,120
 Icky is really good and I think the rule book does a terrible job of introducing you to it but

521
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:10,440
 it's really nice it's got beautiful art again played that on a tabletop simulator and then Planet

522
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:19,800
 Unknown is fine it's got a lazy Susan and I can't remember what Susan stands for but it's an acronym

523
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:25,960
 and it's something like space utilization sort of system something something anyway and that's

524
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,000
 okay it's like a tile playing game into your drafting tiles but where the tiles you can draft

525
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,080
 from changes because of the lady Susan and it's kind of interesting but but a lot of plastic and

526
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,360
 kind of gimmicky and then finally Challengers which won the Kennespiel and that's a game where

527
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:48,200
 you draft a deck and then you play a tournament with your deck every round but the tournament is

528
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,720
 basically you're just turning over the top card of your deck and doing what the card says there's

529
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,520
 not really any you're just kind of running your engine and so most of the game is building your

530
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,080
 engine and then you run it to see if you've got a better engine than your opponent and that one

531
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:06,680
 and next station London are both on board game arena and so it's really good because once you get

532
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:12,120
 the hang of what's going on it's very easy the problem with board game arena is that unlike with

533
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,280
 CTS where you have to read the rules and understand what's happening to manipulate the pieces

534
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,840
 board game arena you can just sort of start going and start clicking and sometimes it can be

535
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:26,760
 unclear what is actually happening when you're clicking and this is this is something I think

536
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,120
 I think they could stand to address in slightly more detail. This is the Scott Kane family

537
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,760
 approach to board game arena so every Tuesday night we pick a game that's not too complicated

538
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,800
 and we just start playing and at the point where Stephen is like oh god I have no idea what I'm

539
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,240
 supposed to do everyone else rolls their eyes and reads the rule book while they're waiting for him

540
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:52,440
 to play. But anyways yeah good good group of games um good little group of games and and would highly

541
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,320
 recommend looking out for them. Challenges might end up in my collection I haven't decided yet but

542
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,840
 it is quite an interesting little little game and especially like because I like I've got sushi

543
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:08,680
 go because I like drafting mechanics but obviously like challenges kind of takes the drafting to the

544
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:15,960
 place where like magic has taken it but without needing to know how the game you're drafting for

545
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:22,440
 works. Oh that looks right up our street complexity two out of five plays with four. That was the

546
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:29,240
 thought podcast and it's goodbye for me. It's goodbye for me. It's goodbye for me. Okay and then

547
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,800
 we should stop recording and start again. Yes.

548
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:53,960
 [Music]

549
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:59,320
 I started reading the Lewis McMasterful Joel books with cryo-bum.

550
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,320
 [Laughter]

551
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,200
 Because that was the one that was in the packet and it worked fine. It worked fine.

552
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,160
 It's like people get very confused but it's just it turns out most authors don't expect you to have

553
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,560
 read literally everything they've ever read in the or written in the order that they wrote it.

554
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:19,480
 No and even when they do part of the job of their editor is to make sure that there are.

555
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,640
 So that's that's kind of brilliant actually though I do like it because the thing with I think the

556
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,440
 thing with cryo-burn is and I hope I'm thinking the right one. Cryo-burn is basically absolutely fine

557
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,720
 but like the long-term fans would read like the last page and cry and Joel would be like yeah.

558
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:40,280
 Yep this is the exact conversation I had with Claire. She was like isn't the last page sad and

559
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:46,840
 I'm like not really. Yeah no the the the last page of cryo-burn is an absolute knife in the gut you know

560
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:53,880
 and it's like and it's like a knife in the gut that you you've been knowing for some books

561
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,600
 was gonna come anyway. Actually no so okay so it's time for another segment which is

562
