1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 There's a joke in here somewhere, but will it be mean?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,440
 Make the joke and then we can workshop it to make it funny. That always works.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,120
 No, I'm not sure we can, that's the problem. I'm cutting my losses.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,680
 No, we don't... we've got a mean joke quota probably and we're going to talk about Locus later, so John's got to be prepared.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:30,240
 [Music]

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,320
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 72nd episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,520
 which is coming to you on the 8th of December 2022. I'm John Coxon.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,640
 I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty. Alison is cracking up already. We haven't even started.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:59,280
 So we have some letters of comment. Yeah, we got some, we got letters of comment.

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,160
 We have lots of letters of comment because lots of people gave us suggestions for the Octothorpies.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:13,200
 Yes, yes they did. So we heard from Duncan MacGregor who knows on which side his

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,800
 bread is buttered because he suggested categories for Best Alison, Best John and Best Liz.

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,560
 And that would be very flattering obviously but we wouldn't be able to on any account

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,440
 award them to ourselves and so that would be an incredibly meta category that would lead to a

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,280
 lot of interesting wrangling. I am immediately recusing myself from the Best Alison category.

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,640
 Ali Baker, Alison Abramovitz. I suppose there is a risk that like...

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,360
 There's a risk that I don't win, yes. That would be the great risk but...

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,240
 Well but there's also a risk that I nominate Alison for Best Liz and vice versa.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,600
 In what way am I... In what way am I the Best Alison?

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,120
 In what way aren't you?

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,640
 Hmm. I don't know, I feel I want to win Best Liz once and then recuse myself forever.

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,600
 That does seem reasonable. I don't know if I want to win Best John. There are a number of options

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,120
 for Best John. Do Jonathans count? We would have to have a serious discussion about eligibility.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
 No they definitely don't.

25
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,320
 Okay and do Alison's spelt with a Y count?

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,320
 Maybe or Alison's with two L's?

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,360
 Ali Baker... In a late LoC Ali Baker has just noticed that the FA Cup contains a

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
 women's team called Hashtag United.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,280
 And maybe they should be our... and suggests they should be our official sportsball team.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,880
 Another suggestion for a Octothorpies category is from Hugo, Girl! which is "Proposal: Best Transatlantic

31
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,680
 Podcast Besties (No Reason)" which is thoroughly great.

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,920
 Awww. Yes. We'll vote for you if you vote for us!

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:00,560
 Yeah. Ang emailed us and said "Morning team! I nominate my cats for Best Cats That Are Not Badger."

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,840
 Which yeah leaves the obvious obvious second category of Best Cats That Are Badger

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
 which much like the Alison, John and Liz categories is going to be an interesting set of nominees.

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,440
 Yup. I suspect what we will see is Badger will be nominated and then a variety of cats in Badger

37
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,640
 cosplays. I mean... Badger is known for being a very large black cat so really anyone who has a

38
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,880
 large black cat could nominate it as Best Badger. Or I could buy my cats cat fat suits and put them

39
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,880
 in cat fat suits. Yeah your cats are a bit small to be Best Badgers.

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:42,800
 John are you cat fat shaming? Not shaming. All cats are very valid in their various sizes but I'm

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,680
 worried that it would be too obvious that my cats are not Badger to win the award.

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,120
 I'm kind of going the existence of fat suits is a kind of inherently fat shaming thing

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,400
 because fat suits only exist because people want to have characters of size being played by

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,960
 thin actors which is a kind of size-phobic thing to be doing. Sorry I'm sorry for being very very

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,280
 humourless about this. Agreed in humans but what would you call the cat costume that you could put

46
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,320
 a small cat in to make it larger, Alison? What noun is that that every one of our listeners will

47
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,080
 understand what I'm getting at? Well probably not a cat suit, yeah? It's pretty much the same as

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,280
 if we wanted to disguise Alison as me. We wouldn't put her in a fat suit you'd have to be...

49
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,120
 Stilts? I'm going in an even worse direction aren't I? Let's give up on this train of thought entirely.

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,920
 So now I need apparently I need to lose weight and get stilts. I think you can

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
 you can be whatever weight you like to impersonate me but I do think you're a little bit shorter.

52
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,160
 I am quite a lot shorter than you, I believe. Digging a lot of holes here aren't I? Anyway,

53
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,800
 I think we may have strayed from our topic of cats. Ang says, "Are you going to have the

54
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,640
 Octothorpe's Octoversary on the 80th episode or the 88th episode? What better time to

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,760
 hand out your awards?" and the answer is that we had it on the 64th episode but nobody noticed.

56
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,160
 I think it's got to be I think 88 makes more sense to 64 on account of how we're a base 10 culture.

57
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,720
 Then why does 88 make sense? Surely 80 would make sense. I'm up for 80. Yeah maybe so maybe 80 should

58
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,360
 be our Octoversary. It's complicated isn't it? I mean let's face it it's probably going to be the one

59
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,880
 which corresponds with some kind of major event and I think if we calculate it we can probably wiggle

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,520
 one. You can probably wiggle either 80 or 88 to be at Eastercon right? Uh... pass. I'll do that maths

61
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,840
 at some point I promise. I will say that Shut Up and Sit Down have a novel approach to this

62
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,840
 where they just put increasingly large decimal points after their episode 99 and 199 so they can

63
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,280
 make the round number be a special event. That's why I just listened to podcast episode 199.75.

64
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,560
 I'm not sure if that's better. It's an approach. Plokta had an episode 33 and a third rather

65
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,920
 33 because it was our long-playing episode and it sounds like our Octoversary episode

66
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:23,280
 should be 88.88 recurring. Ang also notes that she cooked a salmon in a dishwasher at the Novacon

67
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,680
 steam room. I'm pretty sure I've read that right. Where did you get the dishwasher from, Ang?

68
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,480
 Write in. Curt Phillips wrote us a long letter which he then sent us an email to say he hadn't

69
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,200
 worked out how to send us it ino email so he was putting it on the Facebook page. So it's on the

70
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,640
 Facebook page. When he says he sent... when he said he sent us an email did he send us an email or

71
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,960
 did he sent you an email? Yeah. They may have just have sent me an email. He says, "John talks improbably

72
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,720
 fast but with perfect clarity." Curt does say that he didn't miss a single word, he just listened faster.

73
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,200
 The great thing about listening to podcast though is that you can listen to them at whatever speed

74
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,360
 you like so that if people talk too fast you can slow the podcast down to hear every word [such as 0.8x for editing this transcript — transcript Ed.] and if

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,000
 people talk too slowly you could speed this podcast up. Only works if we all talk at the same pace as

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,960
 John though and and then he had a good old whine about the Hugos which you can read on our

77
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,960
 Facebook page. And he said, "Your Novacon report was very enjoyable, but I didn't hear mention of a dealers'

78
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,320
 room or an art show" and I'm pretty sure I said I spent the whole weekend in the dealers' room when

79
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,040
 I wasn't in the bar, because I was trading. Yes. We didn't focus on it – I think you mentioned it in

80
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,240
 passing. I hope I didn't cut it out. And there is always an art show at Novacon which is usually

81
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,960
 very good. There was an art show which was very nice and he also says "or did you three simply not

82
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,120
 peek into them?" and John and Liz didn't peek into those rooms because John and Liz were not at Novacon

83
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,920
 I was the only person at Novacon. Mark says "They say science fiction isn't very good at predicting

84
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,120
 the future and seemingly neither are science fiction fans. At least so I concluded on listening to

85
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,760
 Octothorpe 70 yesterday with its confident assertion that Claire and I were in

86
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,800
 Buxton last Thursday." And yes: Claire and Mark never made it to Buxton. Sorry Claire and Mark. So we

87
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,400
 lied, listeners. We lied. But we didn't know we were lying, so that makes it better? We lied the episode

88
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,440
 before last because by the last episode we knew that they weren't in Buxton but I don't think we

89
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,560
 mentioned it so there we go. So this is a LoC on issue 70. I mean to be fair if we did a list of

90
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,760
 everyone who wasn't at Novacon that would be the running time of the episode so it is understandable

91
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,880
 we didn't but equally... yes. It's a good LoC. I mean, if we did a list of all the times that we are wrong

92
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,200
 about something that would probably also make quite a sizable episode by itself. Zing! Liz, do you

93
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,400
 want to read the last part of Mark's letter because it deals with your pick? It does, yes, because my

94
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,160
 pick of Earthsea inspired Mark to take down a copy from his bookshelf of the Earthsea trilogy which was

95
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,520
 at that point the Earthsea trilogy and it seems that he managed to get halfway through chapter seven

96
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,360
 of book three and then stop and he might start again. But actually he'll probably wait until it's 40 years

97
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,400
 since he stopped and will make a note to write back to Octothorpe at that time which we think

98
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:21,760
 will be episode of Octothorpe 174. So basically, if we're still going Mark will write to us in episode

99
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,240
 174 and say he's read Earthsea. Or not. So keep your eyes peeled for that and if you're... I mean I'm

100
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,720
 not going to remember that by episode 174 so Mark I hope you will. If you are listening to this

101
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,360
 back episode at the point where we have released Octothorpe 174 please pause it here go and listen to

102
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:48,160
 174 and then tell us off if we didn't do it. I wanted to move back to the discussion of using

103
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,120
 old receipts as bookmarks and one of the advantages of physical books. I've been thinking... I'm getting

104
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,800
 rid of all of my books I don't think this is quite a pick but but I'm getting rid of an awful

105
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,360
 lot of books at the moment and one of the things about physical books as opposed to electronic books is

106
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,280
 that if you do keep your physical books and you use old tatty bits of paper as bookmarks then you

107
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,360
 do have permanent records, as Mark did, of where you gave up on a particular book because your receipts

108
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,240
 are still there 40 years later. We've certainly... some of the books that we've taken

109
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,680
 down from the shelves have bits of paper in at the point where one or other of us gave up on them.

110
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,840
 I'm pretty sure my Kindle also remembers where I was up to and when I last read it. I'm not sure

111
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,600
 how you get that information out but I think it does. Another plus point for ebooks.

112
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,640
 Listeners please write in with your Python packages that can go through a Kindle library and

113
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,960
 work out when you gave up on each book. Thank you very much for writing in Mark. We also heard from

114
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,480
 Christopher J. Garcia who says indeed it is gigabytes. In fact it's now closer to 40 gigabytes because

115
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,160
 he's found another old thumb drive with copies of Claims Department he'd forgotten about. So you

116
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,520
 know noted archivist and curator Christopher J. Garcia showing off his curation and archiving

117
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:11,200
 methods there which is old thumb drives so that's good. Hurrah! I'm not much better, to be fair.

118
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,960
 He does also say that I am a bad person for enjoying Voyager. He also says that your

119
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,200
 off the cuff method for voting for things is in fact the way that they do draft picks in the

120
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,840
 National Basketball Association so I thought that was quite interesting. Yes. Yeah I mean it

121
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,080
 seems still seems like a terrible way of picking, say, politicians but I guess if you have like

122
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,840
 many many draft picks and you just want to allocate them in some way that is semi-fair that's not a

123
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,000
 bad way of doing it. Indeed. Oh and he says he wishes he could go to Novacon one day although as a

124
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,960
 guy who knows an incredibly limited amount of Spanish Novacon is a con that shouldn't move.

125
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,360
 Yeah they've been making that joke for about 49 years so, you know. I've never heard it. Okay.

126
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,240
 It's a generational thing. It's almost like people who are the older members of the community

127
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,760
 shouldn't just be like "oh yes, we did that" and they never say it ever again. DC says in regards to

128
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,840
 Raj's lock that Raj probably doesn't have to pay more to get a full membership in Glasgow

129
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,400
 because they're offering discounted memberships to anyone resident in Scotland. This is not it.

130
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,160
 So... and I regret... I regret making this comment on the podcast because a lot of people have written

131
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,840
 in to try and guess what I meant. So I was drunk in a Glasgow in 2024 party at Chicon 8 and the

132
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,000
 lovely Meg MacDonald collard me and said do you want to pay us £100 to upgrade your Supporting

133
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,560
 membership to a Friend membership before the bid session so that when the bid session happens you

134
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,400
 will be automatically upgraded to an Attending member and I said "I haven't bought a Supporting

135
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,320
 membership yet so I can't upgrade" and Meg very wisely saw that it was better to get 100 quid

136
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,760
 out of me then than it was to not do that and just pushed me at the laptop anyway and I filled it in

137
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,400
 like a good little drunk boy. So the reason I owe 20 quid to Glasgow is because I didn't have a

138
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,400
 Supporting membership before I upgraded that Supporting membership to a Friend membership.

139
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,760
 I suspect I am the only person to whom this situation applies so I do apologize for bringing

140
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,720
 it up because I think it's caused some confusion! But yes, it is because I was drunk, and it has nothing

141
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,840
 to do with whether or not I am in Scotland. To the best of my knowledge. You know how they have like

142
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,800
 you know a WSFS membership and then an Attending supplement? Can John have a special Drunken Fuckwit

143
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,600
 supplement which is the extra 20 quid you have to pay them now. Can I make Drunken Fuckwit

144
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 Supplement the episode title? Because I know I can't but that would be very good. I'm

145
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,520
 slightly confused by this because they sold Friend memberships all along to people who didn't

146
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:52,320
 have Pre-Support. Nope they didn't, they stopped in about mid-July. But if you had a Pre-Support

147
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,280
 you could still upgrade to a Friend but they let you have the Friend membership

148
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,840
 anyway due to some form of wanting £100. I think it's a monetary system known as capitalism.

149
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,200
 No some sort of special exception for mates it sounds like because if they wanted £100

150
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,800
 they could have done that for everyone. They also could have just waited on...

151
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,560
 No I think they wanted to make sure they didn't have a huge influx at the end but I suspect

152
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,480
 people in that room in the parties at Chicon was a small enough group that it didn't cause much

153
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,000
 extra work. Oh no, that makes perfect sense. Okay, so, if there's a Drunken

154
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,240
 Fuckwit supplement that feels like if they have a special Drunken Fuckwit membership then I

155
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
 can have that for Pemmi-Con can't I?

156
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:47,840
 Beneath Ceaseless Skies has recused from the Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine.

157
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:55,760
 It has won the World Fantasy and British Fantasy Awards and it has been... it has been a finalist for Best Semiprozine

158
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,840
 ten times and they have recused themselves from the category. They want to support other indie

159
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,640
 zines run by dedicated staff and publishing great and important stories whose work deserves

160
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,400
 a Best Semiprozine finalist spot and the corresponding boost in reach and support.

161
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,400
 This is great. I think I'm on the record as saying that once you've won in a category more than a

162
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,160
 handful of times you need to recuse and let the rest of the genre have its time in the sun – and I'm

163
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,080
 looking at you, Uncanny Magazine, when I say that – but I think it had never really occurred to me that

164
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,000
 long-time finalists might want to do the same thing and this seems like a really positive move.

165
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,480
 Especially long-time finalists in the Best Semiprozine category which seems to be quite static.

166
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,680
 It doesn't... it's not a very vibrant category. It doesn't showcase the best work in the field so much as it just

167
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,200
 repeatedly rewards the usual suspects and so I guess in categories that are in that bucket

168
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,320
 recusing yourself from a finalist state even when you haven't won it is as good as you can do to

169
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,320
 sort of try and make that category a bit more vibrant. So yeah, this seems really good. Well

170
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,960
 done to Beneath Ceaseless Skies. Do either of you have a hot take on this? I do have a hot take but it's

171
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,800
 mean and we've said we're not allowed any mean jokes, so... Why don't you go for it and then John can

172
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,600
 cut it out if it is too mean? So my hot take is "Oh, I'm recusing myself from the Best Semiprozine

173
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,280
 category where I might have to stand up on stage with 43 people, but please all vote for me

174
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,240
 in Best Editor: Short Form" is the actual form of the statement. Beneath Ceaseless Skies have only ever,

175
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,440
 I think, nominated themselves with one editor listed in the category so Beneath Ceaseless Skies is

176
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,400
 the one where they always do just list Scott Andrews and, you know, not the entire list of

177
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,160
 staff. I mean, yeah, there is something in that which is I think it must be really hard to recuse

178
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,400
 yourself from something after being nominated so many times and not winning. It must be hard to

179
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,400
 say "Actually, it's time to recuse myself anyway" and kind of... you know, you never got to do that bit of

180
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,960
 like standing on the stage and getting your spotlight. But they do point out that you can still nominate

181
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,040
 Scott Andrews as best editor and you can still nominate kind of all the individual stories in

182
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,800
 the magazine in the individual categories so while you're taking the magazine out you can still

183
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,080
 nominate its contents and its editor in other categories. So, there is still a chance

184
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,760
 that many people associated with the magazine will get kind of a moment of glory in a way

185
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,440
 that you probably don't if you recuse yourself from, say, Best Fan Writer then you're

186
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:34,640
 recused from Best Fan Writer – that's it. If Beneath Ceaseless Skies changed editor-in-chief I would not

187
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,920
 think it was hypocritical of them to unrecuse themselves as well because I do think that would

188
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,080
 be reasonable. Yeah, Liz is right it is just Scott Andrews who is listed under their thing.

189
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,040
 The only one in that category! So maybe the actual thought process is "well, clearly everyone else

190
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:58,880
 is a giant hivemind collective and I am just a man so I can be safely nominated in one of the

191
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,680
 categories that is just for people and let other hivemind collectives come up in this category".

192
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,160
 That is a much more charitable way of looking at it than mine which probably was

193
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:18,000
 going "What is going on here, is there some ego sense?" I don't think I'm that cynical but I

194
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,760
 kind of looked this is it is it could this have been a cynical go of what is my best scope of

195
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:31,040
 getting a Hugo clearly this category is not it despite us being very regularly nominated.

196
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,120
 Alison, if you've just read the thing on File 770 then I think it is worth you clicking through

197
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,640
 and reading the whole statement. Yeah, it's quite a short statement isn't it? Yeah, but it basically

198
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,440
 says they've already seen while they've been a finalist their readership has doubled

199
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,400
 and they think they've basically got a lot of value out of it. And then, at the end, list a bunch of other

200
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,000
 magazines on the 2020 longlist they think deserve a place on the ballot. So, it

201
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,440
 really does feel like saying we've had a great success from this here are some other

202
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,640
 magazines we think could take our place and enjoy the boosted readership. Oh no, you're

203
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,600
 right: I hadn't clicked through, I'm a moron. I had clicked through once but I hadn't clicked through

204
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,200
 sufficiently to get to the actual statement. Right, I see, yes. So I think it's very

205
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,040
 nice, really. And I think I would find it hard to do myself if I was nominated a lot and I

206
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,960
 never quite made it to winning. I think it would be hard to say "actually, don't nominate me

207
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,880
 again". So I think I'm going to quickly list... so the ones that he recommends in his statement are

208
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,400
 Mermaids Monthly, khōréō (sorry if I've pronounced that wrong), Fireside, Diabolical Plots, The Deadlands

209
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,760
 and Giganotasaurus. Fireside's an interesting one because that is not an uncontroversial

210
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,960
 recommendation, lately. He's not completely recusing himself from the possibility of winning a Hugo

211
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,480
 Award because he's still eligible in another category whereas obviously if we recuse ourselves

212
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,040
 for Octothorpe we would not be eligible in any other categories so we would be permanently...

213
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,800
 Speak for yourself, sunshine. I mean I would like to say that I did go and look it up because I think

214
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,600
 Mermaids Monthly has not published anything since 2021 so I think they're actually not eligible this

215
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,760
 year. They basically did 12 issues, and then I'm not sure if a second set of 12 issues has come

216
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,600
 out, or if that might happen in 2023, or if it has folded but I do not believe they're eligible next

217
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,440
 year unless I have missed something. Interesting. The last thing on their blog is saying "we're about

218
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:36,000
 to launch our 2022 fundraiser" and that was July. Yes, but if you look at their 2022 fundraiser... oh, sorry,

219
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,960
 they were, sorry. Yeah, they've got a 2021 fundraiser which didn't make its target so it looks like they

220
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,920
 must be launching a new one in 2022 that maybe will run in 2023 that the idea was they were

221
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,760
 going to hand it over to new set of editors for the second year and I think that

222
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,200
 didn't make its fundraising target and never happened but I don't know whether it's coming back again.

223
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,240
 But I didn't want to say too much about that, just that don't nominate them in 2022

224
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,280
 because they're not eligible. So Mermaids Monthly were pretty close to making the ballot this year

225
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,160
 but didn't quite make it and will not be eligible next year. So keep an eye on them for future years

226
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:18,800
 if they return. Giganotosaurus was last a finalist in 2017, Fireside was last a finalist in 2020.

227
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:26,480
 I don't think the others mentioned in the statement have ever been finalists before but I might be wrong.

228
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,000
 So, yes, it would be nice to see some of these categories mixing up a bit and people having a

229
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,040
 longer look at the longlist to find things that they want.

230
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:47,840
 Shall we move on to the Locus fundraiser? So, Locus is having what it calls a first

231
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,840
 annual crowdfunding campaign. Yes. So for example my pub, my local pub, had a terrible time at the

232
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,320
 beginning of the pandemic and it's a very much community pub. It's kind of run as a community

233
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,480
 theater, there's a lot of stuff like that. It is the Old Rose and Crown in Walthamstow for anyone

234
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,720
 who's listening, and they had a fundraiser to kind of get them over that immediate pandemic-y

235
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,920
 hump but there was never any suggestion that... If you're a pub your job is to sell food and drink

236
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,640
 to members of the public and theatre tickets in a way that covers your costs, yeah? And if you're

237
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,920
 a magazine your job is to sell your magazine to members of the public at a rate that covers the

238
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,720
 costs so I wouldn't mind Locus saying "oh god, guys, we're in a bit of a pickle we're having a crowdfunder

239
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,960
 to get us over this hump that we find ourselves in", but I feel like the the long-term

240
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,080
 goal of a magazine should be to run to break even rather to say "oh and we're going to come back

241
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,040
 every year for extra money". It felt a bit odd to me. It's kind of like "yeah, no, we're just going to

242
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:02,160
 be loss-making forever but the authors will support us" and maybe they will? I think this is a really

243
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,880
 good argument for why semiprozine is such a tricky category because the difference between a pro

244
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,360
 magazine and a semipro magazine is not obvious and I think this blurs it even more. Because obviously,

245
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:23,440
 lots of the semiprozines in the field rely on crowdfunders to happen and I don't think it's

246
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,160
 unreasonable to say, you know, "if you like this thing and you want it to keep going throw us some

247
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,040
 money". I mean, I don't think it's any more ridiculous than like a pay-what-you-want video game on itch.

248
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:44,320
 I think with more niche stuff and more niche categories it is harder to find the ability to

249
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:51,840
 do that commercially? I mean, I think a pub is a bad example because although I like pubs, I think

250
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,400
 especially the old-fashioned community pubs to which you refer... they're very similar and so if one pub

251
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,200
 goes out of business there'll be another pub somewhere in your town whereas if Locus goes out of business

252
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,000
 there'll be other magazines but there won't be another Locus magazine and so I think there is a

253
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,200
 uniqueness to it as well. I mean somewhere in my town if my town is London but not somewhere in my

254
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,480
 town if my town is Walthamstow, really. I'm going to say something here which is... as obviously

255
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,200
 someone who married someone who lived in the San Francisco area there is a problem which is

256
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,080
 San Francisco is rapidly becoming the sort of place where if you are not rich you cannot be

257
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,480
 and so that works a lot like if you work for Apple or Google or Facebook or any of these massive

258
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,240
 companies where you make a lot of money, living and working in San Francisco is great and hurrah.

259
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,640
 But there is a reason that magazines like Macworld have been downsizing their San Francisco

260
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,240
 office space and moving to remote workers and that is because having a full-time staff all of whom

261
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,840
 live in San Francisco is rapidly going to become untenable. And it's untenable now but in ten years'

262
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,760
 time it is going to be worse than it is now. It's a pretty... it's a pretty mean take. You're

263
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,080
 basically... because what is your conclusion to this? That they should

264
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,800
 move somewhere that is not San Francisco? Or Oakland to be specific? I mean I don't... and I think

265
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,400
 that sucks, but I don't see how Locus can remain profitable if it hires six full-time people who

266
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,560
 live and work in the Bay Area because I know people who live and work in the Bay Area and they're

267
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,080
 moving out and that's because the Bay Area is becoming unlivable and that isn't Locus' fault

268
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,680
 but it is true. And it's worse now than it was a decade ago when I met

269
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,160
 España and it will be worse in a decade than it is now and so unless Locus have a plan...

270
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,800
 Locus can't just stay afloat. Locus will need to find more money because it's getting more

271
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:49,440
 expensive not less and especially with inflation at 10% globally I don't see how this works. And so,

272
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,360
 yeah, if they're determined to maintain a staff of six all of whom live in the Bay Area... and it sucks

273
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,160
 because I love San Francisco and I think it's part of the death of the area and if we're going to

274
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,240
 talk about this we could talk about it and I have really strong and really mournful opinions about

275
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,600
 it because I think San Francisco is dying and I think this sort of thing will die because it is

276
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,800
 based there. And that's horrible. But it's not unreasonable to try, but equally I don't think

277
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:18,080
 it will work. These funds fulfill three main purposes which are paying people to live and work in the

278
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:25,040
 Bay Area, creating a top-notch print magazine and the overhead for our office space which is

279
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,560
 presumably also in the Bay Area. And I'm like, I don't think... Obviously you know I don't believe

280
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,320
 in print magazines, I'm just giving away all my text-based documents that's not fundamentally

281
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,480
 art-based, so I don't think I believe in any of those three goals. I don't think those three goals

282
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,680
 are things that we should be directly supporting. I mean I don't mind if people support them

283
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:54,000
 but somebody's like are you kicking into the Locus Indiegogo the answer is no because you've told me

284
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,720
 that you're doing three things that I believe are not good uses for human funds.

285
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,560
 I don't really have a problem with print media I mean I don't buy print magazines bu I don't

286
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:11,920
 have a huge problem with it. And especially maintaining a Bay Area office space, I mean... They do say elsewhere

287
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,000
 that they basically... I mean I don't know how up-to-date this is but they have a Patreon where they say that

288
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,160
 they share some offices in a house in Oakland with lots of other non-profits. So I don't know

289
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,480
 how kind of sustainable that is. So my feeling is that yeah the value of Locus is having a news

290
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,880
 magazine that covers the field, but that is what I like this is not necessarily tied to it being

291
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,600
 in a particular location or producing a print magazine. And what I can't see from this fundraiser

292
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,080
 is kind of how sustainable this is? Magazines that fund themselves with an annual Kickstarter: there

293
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,960
 are lots of semiprozines that fund themselves with annual Kickstarters in this way. But I assume

294
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,760
 they have a goal and that goal is to cover the running expenses of the magazine and it's

295
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,800
 usually, their running expenses are more like $20,000 and then they have stretch

296
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,080
 goals whereas this is trying to raise $75,000 out of the over $600,000

297
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,560
 they need so you know they're saying if they get $75,000 taking

298
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,880
 away their subscription and existing revenue, they still need to get $240,000.

299
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,840
 That is just such a monumental task to be crowdfunded. What I'm missing here is

300
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,960
 how they think in future years they will be on a sustainable level? And can I digress for five

301
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,200
 minutes? So, there is a website called Metafilter which I've been reading for many many years and

302
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,480
 for many years they've had now an annual fund drive. And what has become clear in the past couple of

303
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,360
 years is that they had an annual fund drive which was just about getting them the money they needed to

304
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,200
 continue, but it was not sustainable because their other sources of revenue were shrinking. And they

305
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,040
 kind of got to this year and went "oh wait, hang on. Our other sources of revenue have been shrinking,

306
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,240
 our pool of savings is going down, and actually just asking people for money once a year and getting

307
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,920
 a bit is not putting us on a sustainable footing for the future". And so there's lots I

308
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,240
 can't get into here but they basically been a change of ownership there's now kind of a community

309
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,960
 organization board they've been taking a thorough look at finances, at future funding models, and

310
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,440
 this year's fundraising drive has basically said look we've got three models: if we get this much

311
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,520
 money we can survive, if we get this much money this is the extra things we can do to make ourselves

312
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,480
 more sustainable, and if we get anything above that here's future things we'll do. I'm

313
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,960
 sort of looking for something a bit more like that. Are Locus thinking, actually, we can increase

314
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,280
 the number of subscriptions, and we can do this kind of fundraising drive? Where we they sell

315
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,520
 magazines but they're also selling like a bunch of extra things like you do in any fundraising

316
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,360
 auction? Do they think that this is going to get them through every year or are they going to come

317
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,240
 back next year? Maybe ad revenues have gone down, subscriptions have increased a bit, the cost of

318
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,040
 living has increased a bit and now they actually need $125,000 to survive? They're not

319
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,800
 obliged to provide me with their future business plans but when I'm supporting... there's

320
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,720
 something is coming and saying "can you help support us for the future?" I like to see

321
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,320
 that they have a sustainable plan for the future. Business models change, and Locus is a decade or more

322
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:14,720
 behind. You know, most small special interest magazines have gone fully digital or no longer

323
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:21,920
 exist. Locus has done very well to survive as long as it has with a full-time staff of six

324
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:30,080
 in this space because lots of magazines like that aren't around anymore. Is that true in

325
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,480
 our space? Because like Asimov's is still both, right? It's a fiction magazine. This is kind

326
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,880
 of a specialist industry magazine. It's difficult because they don't break out their... in the thing

327
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,800
 they break it out into paying writers, editors and artists; sustaining issues, website and awards; and

328
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:53,680
 Locus HQ. And Locus HQ is the lowest at 60 grand and paying writers, editors, and artists is 450.

329
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,840
 And if you read that you might think "oh, most of their money is going on commissioning content"

330
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,000
 but the 450 is where the staff costs for the six full-time staff are. This entire fundraiser would be...

331
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,520
 I mean they're asking for $75,000 and if they got rid of their office space that would make up $60,000

332
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,480
 of it. But, like, then where you put the Hugos, I guess? No, they were like, "we want to raise a lot of money,

333
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,920
 we're going to have an auction". They've got 30 Hugos they'll raise a fair packet.

334
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,280
 Oh, that's true. We could bid on them all, and give them out of the inaugural Octothorpies guys

335
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,680
 sustaining the issues is in the 130 grand line item and I have no idea how much that costs to do

336
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,440
 but I have to be honest I think a Locus magazine that doesn't have an office and doesn't have a

337
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,400
 print magazine but does still do what Locus does is way more valuable than a Locus that does have

338
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,240
 an office and does have a print magazine but is slowly becoming more and more unviable.

339
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,520
 I'd rather see them pivot, and continue. And works remotely. Well, it's tricky right? Because

340
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:57,120
 because like what do you do with the staff? Do you say you move or we fire you? I don't want to have that

341
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,400
 conversation with six people I manage. No, no, you say we cannot increase your salary. That's

342
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,440
 how this is done. So people go "well we cannot survive in the Bay Area on this salary" and at that point

343
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,760
 you go "well, have you considered working working remotely somewhere that is not

344
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,760
 in daily commuter range of our offices in Oakland." Many companies have done this, but the

345
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,320
 thing is that if a new business started up today to do what Locus does it wouldn't have

346
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,720
 an office. Businesses like that don't have offices anymore, if they're new businesses. They only have

347
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,040
 offices if they're old businesses, because that's the way these sorts of things used to be done.

348
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,960
 Nowadays businesses of this kind work remotely and occasionally hire meeting space. I don't know

349
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,720
 how extensive the Locus archives are. I can see that it's something that they are currently preserving

350
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,600
 and maybe that needs to be preserved in a library somewhere? But also things like, if you are Locus

351
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,320
 you are getting a lot of books delivered to your office so you probably do need some physical

352
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,400
 space somewhere. It just doesn't necessarily have to be where it currently is. I mean, review books are

353
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,560
 also electronic now. Yeah, but look at like, Scalzi's blog, he still gets a lot of paper books. I don't

354
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:20,320
 know how... Yeah, Langford does too. Yeah, people are still sending paper books as well. I want Locus to

355
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:28,400
 continue, but equally, I have never read Locus and it is not clear to me that the way they are going

356
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,200
 about this... Even if they hit their fundraiser this time I would not want to bet money that they

357
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
 would still exist in five years. Because it doesn't seem like they're making any of the changes they

358
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,600
 need to make to be sustainable. So, Locus, hard love, pivot. They're going to have to change a lot or

359
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,600
 they're going to die and I don't think they're willing to change a lot so I think they're going

360
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,920
 to die? And I don't think that's good but I do think that if you made me bet £10 either way

361
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,240
 I wouldn't be betting on them being around in five years. Yeah, I think... see where we are

362
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,720
 this time next year because they say they're having an auction and a subscription drive and

363
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,040
 potentially they'll get quite a lot of extra subscriptions, which will put them on a good

364
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,520
 footing? Because that's what you really need, you need that kind of consistent revenue rather than

365
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,320
 people paying you $100 for something cool in an auction. Maybe more

366
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,360
 stuff will come out but that's kind of what I'm hoping we'll see over the next year: Exactly

367
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,240
 what what the proactive steps are, so that next year isn't actually now we need $100,000

368
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,560
 to survive. I'm still not betting you that $10 though. No, me neither.

369
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:42,720
 Shall we do some picks? Picks, picks, picks. What order are we doing this in?

370
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:49,360
 What's happened here, listeners, is Liz and I, last episode, were debating which of us would get to pick

371
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,760
 Andor and in order to make this decision easier for us Alison decided to watch the first episode

372
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,440
 of Andor so she could pick it too. And so we have a three-way tie and, yeah... And I had a backup

373
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,680
 pick in case Liz wanted to pick Andor, and now all is Andor. So obviously I

374
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,360
 want to go first because I've only seen the first episode and then if these guys get spoilery I can

375
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,560
 just take my headphones off. So I had a couple of things to say about Andor, having watched

376
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,200
 exactly one episode. The first is that all of my friends are talking about it, not just John and

377
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:31,440
 Liz but all over the internet people are saying "gosh this series is very good" in a way that I

378
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,920
 don't think has happened for the television output of the Star Wars universe before. That it's very

379
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,960
 good in terms of what television should be and how it should be and things like that. I know none of

380
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,000
 this because I've only seen the first episode. Right from almost the first second you know you're in

381
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,160
 the Star Wars universe there's nowhere else you could be there's tons of stuff this is just incredibly

382
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,200
 Star Wars-y a bit about it all over the place and I really like that because I like the sense

383
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,320
 that they are building a consistent universe here despite the fact that it's enormously diverse

384
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:12,560
 and has all sorts of different things going on, but nevertheless it's... It's all very consistent.

385
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:19,520
 Everyone likes it. You are not wrong! I mean it's true, I... John is the Star Wars fan here I am not

386
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,760
 particularly... I mean I like Star Wars but I'm not, like, a fan in the way John is. And I have not in fact

387
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,280
 bothered watching any of the other Star Wars TV shows yet. And the internet is loving Andor in a

388
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,280
 way I can't remember it loving anything except possibly that time when baby Yoda ate a frog. Yeah. And

389
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,720
 even then, that was like a 30 second bit of an episode. Yeah, basically everyone watched it and was like "oh

390
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:48,000
 actually this is what you can do in the Star Wars universe". I think it's the second good TV show in

391
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,760
 Star Wars, the first one being Rebels. Rebels is animated so I know a lot of people who just don't

392
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,440
 watch animated stuff and you're like "you can watch animated stuff" and they're like "yeah yeah yeah" and they don't.

393
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,680
 And also rebels is explicitly aimed at a much younger audience, and it did... And so I think that

394
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,120
 is two reasons why it was not widely discussed. In much the same way that the reason that

395
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,320
 we didn't get much YA on the Hugo ballot until the Lodestar award was because you don't tend to

396
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,680
 nominate stuff aimed at a younger audience in the big serious awards. But Andor is definitely

397
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:27,520
 the first good live-action TV show they've done. I liked Kenobi but it had problems, and one of the

398
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,200
 problems it has is it filmed in The Volume. And Andor is filmed uh, in, you know, places. And it

399
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,000
 turns out you can do a lot more if you aren't limited to a small circle surrounded by

400
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,480
 monitors. Who knew? But yeah, I think one of the senses of place... and I think this goes back to

401
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,600
 what Alison was saying about the Star Wars setting. The use of sets and and kind of the use of real

402
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:55,280
 places it makes it feel much more like you're in a place rather than kind of just not, really.

403
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:04,400
 And the Mandalorian feels kind of really insubstantial in a way, and so does Kenobi, that Andor did not.

404
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,680
 And the insubstantiality is one of the problems that the prequel trilogy has, that the

405
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,960
 original trilogy did not. And I wonder if it comes from over-reliance on this one technique that they

406
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,840
 used for the Mandalorian and then carried on using for the other stuff. It feels a lot like sort of,

407
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:27,600
 maybe British 70s TV sci-fi in a good way? I mean someone did a kind of fake 70s opening credits for

408
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,880
 Andor which are brilliant. But there's just something about it being, like... there's bits of it set in

409
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,640
 in cities, there's bits of it set, you know... they do a lot of walking around hills and in the rain and in

410
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,040
 just sort of slightly gloomy-looking remote areas. There's something about that, and there's something

411
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,160
 about the fact that the cast is full of British character actors as well. That plus the fact that

412
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,280
 Star Wars always had this way of using the technology which has not advanced since the Star Wars of

413
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,920
 the 70s. They managed to integrate this... Everything is like giant button-pushing machines like you

414
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,120
 find in an abandoned 70s power plant kind of thing. And somehow they integrate all of that and for the

415
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:14,400
 first time it didn't seem to feel like it was deliberately limiting themselves to this

416
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,240
 level of technology, it felt like they'd really embraced that and just said "right, this

417
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,520
 is our aesthetic for the show and everything's going to make sense". Mmm-mmm. No, exactly. The other thing about

418
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,680
 Andor is it is really I thought it got good after episode three I thought the first three episodes...

419
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,680
 And I think there is a reason that when the first three episodes dropped on Disney+ it did not

420
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,040
 immediately make the sorts of waves that it is making now that it has wrapped up. There are a couple of things

421
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,160
 that really kick into high gear after episode three and a couple of annoying narrative devices

422
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:51,360
 that are left behind. And I think first three episodes are setting up the last nine and the last nine

423
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,960
 are where the real gold is. Do you think that's fair, Liz? I think so. I think what I will say is that

424
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,920
 they dropped the first three episodes together and thereafter it came out week-by-week and I watched

425
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,160
 the first three episodes... I didn't watch them all together. I watched one, and then took a break and

426
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,760
 watched the next one, and they did not work nearly as well for me as for people who watched the first

427
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,400
 three because they do very much form a little kind of mini arc. And that was... I mean the rest of the

428
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,920
 season was basically a series of mini arcs and I think that first one works much better as three

429
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,400
 episodes together because I didn't feel the episodes had a strong enough episodic structure.

430
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,840
 Whereas in the later mini arcs, each episode I think has a much stronger structure even when it's set

431
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:35,360
 into this mini arc. I think also, after I looked at episode three, where I predicted some of the

432
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,960
 characters would go is completely not where they went. You know, there were things I was thinking "oh

433
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,720
 this is what's going to happen to this person and this person, and nope, completely off." Oh that's good.

434
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,120
 That's a good sign. Yeah. Do you mind casting spoilers Alison? I mean I don't mind spoilers, really.

435
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,360
 I think our listeners might though. Yeah I'm not going to do any plot spoilers, but Andy Serkis

436
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:01,200
 pops up later in the show and it might be the best performance he's ever given. He is just

437
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:09,280
 amazing in it. Doc Brown or Ben Bailey plays a role which is very good. I didn't recognise him at all!

438
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,280
 Like, I've watched him in Taskmaster, I did not realize it was the same person. I thought someone was having

439
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,320
 a joke and then they were like no he uses a different name for acting, it's the same person.

440
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:23,760
 What?! Yeah. Yeah. I think he's credited as Ben Bailey, his name's Ben Smith, but he was on Taskmaster as

441
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,200
 Doc Brown? So like, I'm very sorry if I get how he is credited wrong but it is all the same man, and I

442
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,640
 love that man. He's good man. And one of the reasons why I've been rooting for his character.

443
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,360
 There seems to be some scenes of happy natives and I really don't like that. Anyway, onwards.

444
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:49,120
 Yeah, that's the stuff from the first episode about... not Ferrix... Cassian's... Oh, right.

445
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:58,960
 Cassian's background is we are a peaceful untechnological civilization and

446
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,800
 I find that very annoying but there we go. I know what you mean about the happy natives thing

447
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,800
 Basically there's a line in Rogue One where Cassian says that he's been in this fight since he was

448
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,080
 six years old... or is it five years old? But it's like an implausibly young age. And at the time

449
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,360
 I assumed that that was hyperbole and in those scenes I don't think he's as young as he says he was

450
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,160
 in Rogue One but I think it's basically an attempt to square the circle without just having him

451
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:32,400
 portrayed as an actual child soldier? One of the problems with Star Wars YA media and

452
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,800
 kids' media is that Star Wars does actually turn out to have a lot of child soldiers in it because

453
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,920
 if you write novels aimed at kids, the kids have to be protagonists, and because it's a story about

454
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,240
 war, they end up fighting in a war? And if you think about it too much it gets really awkward really

455
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:58,400
 quickly. But I will say that the happy natives motif does not persist through the entire series.

456
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,880
 Can I have a digression where I talk about being old a little bit? Which is that when I was growing

457
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,720
 up, which was the 70s, an enormous amount of the cultural touchstones were heavily influenced by

458
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,920
 the Second World War and people... And the fact that the creators were people who at the time were

459
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,040
 people who had come out of that or been incredibly influenced by the immediate post-war times. It's

460
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,200
 true in America as well. And this came up the other day by the fact that I have a

461
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:35,360
 1974 Dad's Army board game which can't go unblurred onto eBay because it has swastikas on the cover

462
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:42,080
 because it's a wartime thing. But everything about the 70s was driven by people's perceptions of the

463
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:48,880
 Second World War, so that there were war stories everywhere. And so Star Wars... That glorifying war

464
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:57,120
 thing was embedded in the first Star Wars movie. And then, of course it's... We've moved away from

465
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:02,640
 that the whole culture has moved away from "all of our stories of war stories or a huge proportion

466
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,240
 of our stories of war stories". There's still some of that in the kind of formative much that Star

467
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,160
 Wars was developed out of and I think this leads to things like... Because when I was a child there were

468
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,080
 an awful lot of stories about child soldiers and there were also an awful lot of child soldiers.

469
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,920
 We've changed, I think as a planet. Hopefully for the better. Hopefully we won't go back to a world

470
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,520
 where child... Where being a child soldier is glorified. I think you're right and I think

471
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,360
 it's tricky because when you read the stories that are aimed at kids, it doesn't seem problematic

472
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,200
 because the kids have all the agency, and then you read plot summaries of what happened in

473
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,360
 a particular part of Star Wars and it's like then this child was recruited to do this and you're

474
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:50,400
 like "oh no". And it gets a bit... Child spies are another. Yep. You know like Sherlock Holmes had

475
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,680
 child spies, child spies are a very big part of literature traditionally. Children are very

476
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,560
 excited by the idea of being a child spy and then you actually look at what spies do and you go

477
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:07,040
 "oh, oh no". Or pirates, cabin boys, you know the whole... All of our adventure

478
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,680
 literature has this theme running forward through it of pre-teens and young teenage kids doing exciting

479
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,040
 grown-up things which are perhaps not that exciting. So I want to call out some other actors just

480
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,520
 before we stop talking about Andor. I love Adria Arjona as Bix, she was also – and I don't know if

481
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,520
 either of you recognized her – she was Anathema in the TV series Good Omens and she is very different

482
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,080
 in both of those, which I think is great testament to how good she is at acting. That's where

483
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:42,800
 I know her from. Yes. I did not recognize her, apparently I don't recognize anyone. Denise Gough is amazing

484
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:50,160
 as Dedra Meero who is just so good. And Genevieve O'Reilly, who was in Revenge of the Sith but

485
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,040
 got cut, but plays Mon Mothma, and it's really good to see Mon Mothma being, kind of,

486
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,880
 fleshed out given that she just randomly pops up in Return of the Jedi. And it's quite nice to see

487
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,880
 that character come back. And there is another I don't want to do... There's a piece of casting

488
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,560
 which is a huge spoiler for a plot thing which I'm not going to say out loud, but I thought

489
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:15,120
 that that was good. And also, one last thing, the droid! The droid is the best droid. Best droid. So

490
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,960
 it struck me when I was watching Andor that I had just been on a ride called Rise of the

491
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,320
 Resistance but you could basically call Andor Rise of the Resistance instead? And it basically

492
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,640
 digs into the thing that I for one have always really wanted to see in the Star Wars universe which

493
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,520
 is the early days of the resistance. How do you form this resistance movement which

494
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,520
 will go on to bem you know, the... The Rebellion. What, John? The Resistance is 30

495
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,320
 years later, this is the Rebellion. Yeah, well, this is the Rebellion which goes on to be the

496
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,120
 Resistance, right? This is the Rebellion that leads into Rogue One. And this is something... This is the

497
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,000
 other reason I really like Rebels because... a lot of the stuff that Andor does to show

498
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,560
 the early days of the Rebellion and to show Mon Mothma's role in that, and to kind of highlight

499
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,880
 people like Saw Gerrera and how they fit in was done by Rebels, and is being revisited by Andor.

500
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,720
 And so a lot of those themes are really cool but it's weird to revisit them with people who haven't

501
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,720
 watched Rbels because a lot of it is really... I mean I don't know how much this is conscious but

502
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:27,040
 like a lot of these themes are the same themes. Is Rebels set at roughly the same time? Rebels

503
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,520
 is set later but came out earlier? Yeah, but you're basically saying so people who like Andor should

504
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,280
 go and watch Rebels even though they are slightly worried about watching animated things which

505
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,120
 I would endorse your notion is... You know, go and watch animated things guys, they're good. I

506
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:51,440
 don't know if this one is, but in general. Rebels is aimed at a much younger audience so

507
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:58,080
 is probably not as hard-hitting as Andor but I do... I think it is brilliant, but yeah. I mean I'm

508
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,920
 prepared to go and watch Rebels, I just probably was not very aware of it and also

509
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:08,080
 don't remember ever being on any kind of TV service I had access to. I don't know where it was broadcast

510
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:15,040
 in the UK. Ah, no, that is fair. I assume it's on Disney+ now right? It is now, yeah. I also don't

511
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,080
 know where it was broadcast Liz. I've only had Disney+ for like a year because I got it a

512
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:25,600
 year later than you did so I have not caught up with everything that was on Disney+. Oh no, yeah, that's

513
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,000
 that's fair, that's fair. Anyway, I think... Okay, so I think what I'm saying is I like what Andor does

514
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,760
 even if something else has already done it. I think they really lucked out with the fact that they

515
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:40,320
 kind of already had an actress who was Mon Mothma, but who is definitely up to the task of what she

516
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,800
 has to do in this one, which is, I don't know... It's very fascinating to watch the contrast

517
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:52,800
 between her, between Stellan Skarsgård's character, and Andor. And I think the only thing I've

518
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:58,400
 seen that I kind of agree with is some criticism that it feels more like a show which is interested

519
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:06,560
 in a wide range of characters, and maybe loses a bit of its focus on Andor, and I think

520
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:13,200
 Diego Luna does a great job of what is sometimes a very kind of underplayed... his role is quite

521
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:20,080
 underplayed, in that he has to do a lot of the heavy lifting. He never gets to do the big kind of like...

522
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:26,640
 Well there's sort of some big scenes and big monologues that other characters get and it

523
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,000
 feels like he gets a little bit short-changed on some of that? And has to do a lot just kind of

524
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,800
 from his expressions and from us watching him in some ways react to things. So that would be my

525
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,760
 one complaint is that sometimes I was a bit more interested in people who were not Andor rather

526
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,960
 than Andor. Which I probably shouldn't because it's his TV show. But that's a very minor complaint

527
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:54,000
 really. I think, and maybe I'm wrong... I think that one of the great things about Star Wars is like the

528
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,280
 people around the people we care about? Like, I don't think... the original trilogy wouldn't have been

529
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,120
 better if it focused more on Luke, and I don't think the sequel trilogy would have been better if

530
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,760
 it had focused more on Rey, and arguably I think one of the problems the prequel trilogy has is it focuses

531
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,280
 too much on Anakin. And so I think, in actuality, although I see what you mean, I think that's one

532
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:20,080
 of the strengths of Star Wars as a franchise. Is that although it is literally a series of stories

533
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:26,640
 about chosen ones, it doesn't focus on those chosen ones as much as it might. Like the focus is much

534
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,480
 less on the chosen one in any of the given movies than it is on the superhero in a Marvel

535
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,160
 movie for instance. And I think that is to Star Wars' credit. I will also say I don't understand

536
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:45,120
 how I skipped complimenting Diego Luna's acting, because he is great. Like, so good in this entire

537
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,400
 thing. He is so good, he nails it. And so I think you're right there, that in some places he does a

538
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,600
 lot with a little but I do wonder whether they knew he would and so they were able to do that. I

539
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,280
 wonder if they'd had a lesser actor they would have had to focus it more on Andor because

540
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,400
 there wouldn't have been as much there if they hadn't. It might be a, yeah... It might be an

541
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,800
 expression of trust in the actor, I guess. We liked Andor, listeners! I haven't liked it yet. I've only

542
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,280
 liked a tenth of it, or a twelfth of it. But I am expecting to like the rest. I'm very much looking

543
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:19,360
 forward to watching it. I have had to pause my ongoing Expanse watch in order to fit Andor in.

544
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:26,880
 This does beg a question, and the question it begs is is this better... I would argue this is

545
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,520
 probably going to get nominated for Best Long Form... because I don't think there's a standout

546
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,840
 episode, I think it's just a very tight 12 episode thing. And I would argue similar about Severance? So

547
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:43,440
 then my question is if this and Severance are on the Long Form ballot, which do you vote for?

548
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,720
 Um, Everything Everywhere All At Once. If it was between this and Severance which would you vote for? I've

549
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:54,400
 only seen one episode give me a chance. I think I did say that. Okay. Look, Alison has managed

550
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,480
 to watch all of Severance which means by Alison's standards it was extremely compelling because

551
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:04,400
 she's watched it in, you know, under a year. So, I mean it seems like Severance. Oh, yeah, no,

552
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,560
 could be argued... What about you, Liz? It's tricky, but I think I would probably go with Andor. But

553
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:16,080
 bear in mind I just literally finished watching Andor, so. I've literally not had a chance... As soon

554
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:22,400
 as I noticed Andor I started watching it and then we were prevented from watching more episodes by

555
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,800
 not being at home so we'll see a second ep. Ask me the next time how many episodes I've watched

556
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:34,240
 because it might be 12. I am going to be a bad Star Wars fan. I think I preferred Severance to Andor. If

557
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,440
 it was between the two I would vote for Severance. It would be a strange universe if John ends up

558
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,200
 voting for something non-Star Wars where I vote for a Star Wars thing, won't it. Yes. Come back in January

559
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,240
 when we're going to discuss this in more detail, guys. And that was the Octothorpe podcast. And it's goodbye

560
00:52:50,240 --> 00:53:06,160
 from me. It's goodbye from me. And it's goodbye from me.

561
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:20,800
 I have an anti-pick for the logo which I hate with a fiery fiery passion because people talk about

562
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,720
 the effective use of negative space and this isn't it. This is how to do something clever with

563
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:34,320
 negative space and therefore make your logo unreadable and stupid. And apparently there was a logo for

564
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,800
 this that was released a couple of years ago that looks like a perfectly reasonable logo and now

565
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,840
 there's this logo which is unreadable and crap and oh god it's very annoying. I will say I disagree with

566
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:51,440
 Alison on the logo because I correctly read the logo and it says Andor. So I don't think it's

567
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:59,120
 unreadable. Hot take. I quite like the logo. I don't have strong feelings on it, I guess? I'm like a four out of

568
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:07,760
 ten. Yeah, my hot take is I don't care. The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by
