1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 Oh, it sounds good. Am I loud enough? Am I in a tunnel?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,320
 Is Liz in a tunnel?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,400
 And hello? Yes?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,960
 Alison, please talk.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,840
 Oh, yes, please keep going.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,280
 Oh, no, it's just a voice.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
 Keep talking infinitely.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,600
 Don't stop talking.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,640
 Keep talking and don't be exposed.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,440
 Yes.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,200
 It is quite hypnotic, actually.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Laughter]

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,480
 Don't.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,720
 OctaThop ASMR channel.

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,080
 Coming soon.

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,520
 Appartition.

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,480
 Well done. Can you hear me?

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:40,880
 Yes.

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,360
 Yes.

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,080
 Yep, wonderful.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,440
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 81st episode of OctaThop, the podcast for Science Fiction

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,240
 and Science Fiction Random, which is coming to you on the 13th of April 2023, but also live from

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
 EasterCon. I'm John Coxson.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
 I'm Alison Scott.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,280
 And I'm Liz Batty.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,800
 And Alison is a giant head to my left and to my right.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,920
 I mean, in general.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,080
 So I come along virtually to join this panel because I was feeling completely fine when I went

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
 to bed last night, which was about an hour and a quarter to five in the morning, and then I woke

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,440
 up at about eight o'clock and thought, I feel just a tiny bit softly.

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,320
 So I am a tiny bit softly person with positive COVID tests and I'm in my room.

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,840
 I could have quite a good time this morning, despite being in my room.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,200
 And at the green room, props to the green room who have brought me a pint of water.

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,560
 Yes.

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,760
 So we all have matching drinks.

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,000
 So we have a stunt Alison, which Liz procured at the Fan Fund auction,

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,440
 which we have here to represent Alison in her absence.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,000
 And for Alison.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,600
 Are you suggesting I'm round?

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,560
 No. We're suggesting you're short.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
 It's completely different.

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
 BB8's pretty round, right?

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,400
 Yes. Yes. For the benefit of audio listeners,

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,040
 yes, is Oleg the Miacat in a BB8 costume, which is apparently Star Wars Tap that John donated to

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,600
 the Fan Fund auction. And then I bought it from the Fan Fund auction, which may be the only time

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,920
 Star Wars Tap has ever gone in that direction.

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
 So Liz, it's really cute.

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,520
 Liz purchased it and then remarked, scandalised later in the bar, that he is naked under his BB8

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,040
 costume. So, you know, I mean, I don't know what I expected it to be a cat.

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,000
 Yes.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
 Can you not suggest you could add a topically correct me a cat, are you?

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
 I know. No one was suggesting that.

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,320
 I think it under is naked under his BB8 suit.

54
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,680
 And we, yes, we had a good time at the Fan Fund auction.

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,320
 We sold some Adrian Krakowski books for like 280 pounds, James Shields,

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,080
 who is in the audience looking very happy with himself.

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,240
 And that was very good. And I purchased a copy of all these worlds reviews and essays by Neil

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,480
 Harrison, which came with a free 1000 word review that I can, we can make, Hog and I went

59
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,160
 halves on our bid and we can make Neil write a review that is 1000 words of anything we want.

60
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,480
 And so we broke the news to him on the third row panel as to what it was he would be reviewing.

61
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,680
 So I recommend looking at that on catch up if you haven't seen it. But when the review is written,

62
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,600
 we will doubtless talk about it on the pod.

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,920
 Are we going to talk a little bit about Neil Harrison and his book and in being

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,960
 guest of honor? Neil Harrison is guest of honor.

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,880
 He is guest of honor. I mean, that is one reason why I'm here.

66
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,280
 Not the only reason, but it made it an easier decision to come back because he's the guest of honor.

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,480
 He has written a book which we have plugged a couple of times. We'll plug again.

68
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,600
 We've plugged all potential options through this convention.

69
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,280
 It's a very good book of reviews and essays. It's also very green.

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
 Extremely green.

71
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's very, I do like the design.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,880
 Yeah. And he signed my copy to John, despite shenanigans.

73
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
 So.

74
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,840
 Which shenanigans specifically?

75
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,160
 I didn't ask. I left it as an exercise to the reader.

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,760
 We also have other guests of honor at this convention. So we have a guest of honor in the

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,120
 audience. Carrie Sparing, give Carrie a round of applause.

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:45,280
 I also have all but one of Carrie's books signed by Carrie because I asked how you

79
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,840
 acquired them. And I just got a large box in the post the week after I asked with a book in,

80
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,560
 but they're also very good. I've picked them on this very podcast.

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,960
 You have. You know, who else's books we have picked on this very podcast?

82
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,000
 No, whose books have you checked on this very podcast?

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,320
 Guest of honor, Adrian Tchaikovsky.

84
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,960
 Yes.

85
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,280
 Who John interviewed yesterday.

86
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
 Yes, today. Yes, today. It's been a long.

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,640
 A long weekend.

88
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,840
 So the convention didn't put me on the program at any point.

89
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
 So I was a little bit worried that maybe it was all just a giant prank.

90
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,440
 So I didn't advertise it on the previous episode of Octa Thorpe.

91
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,160
 But again, if you are listening to this and hopefully the catch up

92
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,200
 strange will still be up for a while, you can go and watch Mind's View with Adrian,

93
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,000
 which I think went very well. He is very interesting.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,080
 And we did briefly discuss what a popular worker's uprising in the Mushroom Kingdom would look like.

95
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,840
 So if that interests you, that's a good interview to go and watch on the catch up.

96
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
 And I have a Zencho book here.

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,720
 Zencho being another guest, one of this convention?

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,120
 Yes.

99
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,280
 And such a good reader.

100
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,880
 I went to her reading and it was extremely good.

101
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,000
 But she read from Blackboard's sister in her guest world interview

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,680
 and she very kindly gave me the copy she read from and signed it afterwards.

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,000
 So yes, it's been a, I now have signed books by all the guests of Anna.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
 Hurrah.

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
 All the guests of Anna? What about the virtual ones?

106
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,200
 Oh, no. No, I don't have.

107
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,600
 But they, I mean, I suppose they could virtually sign,

108
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
 but I don't know if there's a pen that goes across the Atlantic.

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,120
 Post them a pen.

110
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,800
 So awaiting for Alice and to say things, she's being uncharacteristically quiet.

111
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
 I guess because you're not writing.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
 Just waiting for the two of you to let me get a worded edgeways

113
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
 and I was also going, "Oh, virtual people don't count, right?"

114
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,560
 It's not normally how it works.

115
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
 You don't normally wait to get a worded edgeways.

116
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,560
 No, that is, I think, it makes sense because you're on Zoom

117
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,480
 and like the timings are a bit more difficult,

118
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,920
 but there is definitely a sense where we very, really need to wait for Alice and to try them in.

119
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,120
 And we might have to adjust our normal podcasting style.

120
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,960
 Because it's like a panel format,

121
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,600
 I'm very conscious of the people in the room who probably don't want to hear me interrupt you all the time.

122
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
 Right, you do know they listen to Octa-Thorp.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,360
 There's a certain, there's a certain expectation of format, I think.

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,840
 They may not all listen to Octa-Thorp.

125
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,040
 I can't see.

126
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,920
 Give me a show of hands.

127
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,200
 Who doesn't listen to Octa-Thorp?

128
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,880
 Okay, so did you hear that massive crash?

129
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,760
 No.

130
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,120
 Okay, fine. Somebody is in this room and I said to the somebody who was in this room,

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,240
 if you stay in this room during Octa-Thorp, you have to be very, very quiet.

132
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,880
 So they've just,

133
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,200
 why exactly is Adrian Krikowski in your room, Alison?

134
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,440
 It's got Adrian.

135
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,480
 What's the name of this?

136
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,360
 It's by sure it happens.

137
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
 Who here does not listen to Octa-Thorp?

138
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
 I'm so sorry.

139
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,680
 This will make, I mean, this is, it's like, you know,

140
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,120
 I came into Lois McMaster bejold books with Cryo-burn,

141
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,440
 which was quite a way towards the end of the series.

142
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,320
 You nearly did a swear word.

143
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,840
 I nearly did a swear word.

144
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
 Well, it was nominated for the Hugo's, where I read it.

145
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,880
 And I was like, that was very good.

146
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
 And then it says other loads of others.

147
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,240
 But loads.

148
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,960
 But yes, this is the 81st instalment of this hot mess.

149
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,360
 And yeah, this is, I mean, it's probably a bit more organized

150
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,200
 when you've heard the edited version.

151
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,280
 I think it's not normally quite such a hot mess as it has been this time.

152
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
 Yeah, I think that's part of the point.

153
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,480
 I mean, we love tech.

154
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,600
 Thank you very much.

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
 Only 37 minutes.

156
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,880
 Well, no, but we are very awkward.

157
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,080
 They were like, oh, I'm pavilion pavilion,

158
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,560
 sounds great.

159
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,840
 But this is the room that this is a good room.

160
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,920
 And I very much like the cabaret seating.

161
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,760
 I very much like that tech, instead of doing their usual tech setup,

162
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,560
 which works for the audio of every other item at the convention,

163
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,080
 for us does like an eight track record and gives us like all the separate things,

164
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
 which they could.

165
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,160
 And I think it would be quite justified.

166
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
 Tell us where to stick that and they don't.

167
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,000
 And that's very nice.

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,800
 I am on the committee.

169
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,360
 So if we could have a round of applause for tech, that would be lovely.

170
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,640
 It'd be great this weekend.

171
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,200
 I mean, because I think the fanfons auction is also an incredibly difficult.

172
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,560
 The fanfons auction worked really well.

173
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,840
 So it was like there was a Zoom component and there was like an in-person component.

174
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,960
 And I won a thing and I ate a marshmallow.

175
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,480
 And I got sorts to tech.

176
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
 So I've now learned the most.

177
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,160
 So there's this series, one of the series that tech had coming into this convention is

178
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,320
 that one of the reasons that people don't volunteer for tech is that they think that

179
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,000
 the basic in-room tech job, where you do sound and picture and things is too hard.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,120
 And JT said to me last night, right, Alison, sit here.

181
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,880
 You need to move this lever because Doug is a bit louder than John.

182
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,080
 So you need to move this lever a little bit down every time John speaks.

183
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
 And you need to leave a little bit back on.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,520
 I'm going to put it up every time John speaks a little bit back down every time Doug speaks.

185
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,960
 Apart from the fact that I moved the wrong lever on multiple occasions and had to try to

186
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,680
 guess where they were, that worked pretty well.

187
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,640
 And then he said, so you see these two buttons.

188
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
 This was a lot of Stream Deck.

189
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,080
 Now, long time listeners of what's thought was that John had a Stream Deck.

190
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,720
 Are you still?

191
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
 See these two buttons.

192
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,560
 If you press this one, which says Zoom on it, you will get the Zoom feed on the screen.

193
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,360
 And if you press this one, which says PowerPoint on it,

194
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
 you will get the catalog on the screen.

195
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,040
 And you just keep switching between those two, when Zoom bid has bid.

196
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,920
 And I just did that.

197
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,560
 It's amazing.

198
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,920
 And now I'm a tech gopher.

199
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,480
 I'm so excited.

200
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
 I've got quotes.

201
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,320
 It was a lot of fun.

202
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,600
 I'm going to do tech or JT in the future because I'll tell you it's a lot easier than being on the committee.

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,280
 That make, yes, that makes sense.

204
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,840
 But no, it was, it was very well, I think.

205
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,280
 What was your, what was your favorite program item you went to this?

206
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,800
 Oh, what is my favorite program item?

207
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,720
 I think, and this surprised me actually, that my favorite program item was the 9am

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,960
 panel item on, sorry, I'll sit close to the microphone, overshoot and the Anthropocene,

209
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,960
 which was a panel sparked by an essay by Neil Harrison, guest friend at this convention,

210
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,200
 writer of all these worlds, reviews and essays.

211
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,600
 Sparking off an essay, he wrote about the concept of the overshoot novel and how this is

212
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,440
 intertwined with more and more work dealing with climate change, the Anthropocene.

213
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:26,960
 And he had a very, very intelligent panel of Abigail Nussbaum, Nick Cobble and Nina Allen to

214
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,000
 discuss it.

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,400
 Anyway, it was a brilliant panel because it basically took a very kind of, it wasn't

216
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,240
 broad and let's discuss everything, it wasn't like let's discuss climate change fiction,

217
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,960
 let's discuss all of this.

218
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,240
 It was like very specifically, how does this particular kind of structure of novels and

219
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:52,960
 other works have the effect that it does and how does this intertwine with the narratives of

220
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,720
 place, the characters in the books.

221
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,040
 Basically, it was just a really interesting like 75-minute deep academic discussion of

222
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,960
 science fiction and I really enjoyed it.

223
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,240
 I think there should be more panel items like that, but we might need to maybe clone some of the

224
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,720
 panelists.

225
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,840
 Fair enough.

226
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,000
 Alison, did you get too much program?

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,160
 No, I went to the fanfone's auction and one of the things about fanfone,

228
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,160
 somebody has just said in chat, "If Alison does tech, it's like we will never see her again."

229
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,520
 And I was like, "Oh, no, maybe because it didn't look like we had any auction,

230
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,480
 beers for the fanfone's auction."

231
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,480
 So, and we had done, but I was saying, "I'll auction," but they didn't look like I was doing

232
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,720
 tech, so we put John into auction and I went back to do tech and then after about half an

233
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,120
 hour, John was like, "You need to auction the next item after this so I can go and have a fee."

234
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,240
 And so I had to get Mark Plummer in to do the second so that I could run to the front

235
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,080
 and auction the item and then run back again.

236
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,640
 So, no, I don't think he thought to be me if I was on the tab.

237
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,280
 Yeah, I would be a very different type of tech, I think, so to say.

238
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,640
 JT's like, "Oh, but I have 20 years of professional experience."

239
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,600
 So, I'm like, "I don't have any of that stuff, but I have a lot of foots for."

240
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,320
 I think my favourite item, can I pick when I was on?

241
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,200
 Liz is making a face.

242
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
 So, if it's not when I was on...

243
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,240
 Was that an interjection from the room that I couldn't hear?

244
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,200
 Could somebody repeat the joke for the benefit of the other member of the Oxford podcast?

245
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,840
 It was not an interjection from the room, it was my face.

246
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,600
 Yes.

247
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,000
 Just imagine this is face and then imagine it's un-unapproving and directed at me,

248
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,480
 which to be fair, shouldn't require much imagination.

249
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
 No, it does not require a lot of imagination.

250
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,120
 This being episode 81.

251
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
 So, I think the one...

252
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,200
 So, I really did enjoy the third row panel because we just made Neil very awkward and it was very funny.

253
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,880
 But, I did also very much enjoy the Zencho interview, which was very, very interesting.

254
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,920
 And I went to a reading.

255
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,480
 I very rarely go to readings at East Collins, but I went to a reading which was also very lovely.

256
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,040
 So, the programme's been very good, I think.

257
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,040
 So, one of the things about being on the course is for an East Confit.

258
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,320
 Is there anyone in the audience who's not been on the committee for East Conf?

259
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,200
 Yes.

260
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,480
 I can't see the audience.

261
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,920
 Loads of people.

262
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
 Loads of people.

263
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,240
 So, the thing about being on the committee is that you just really run around all of the time.

264
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,320
 I was doing comms leave and I carefully organised my job so that every single bit of it could be done.

265
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,480
 Virtually all I needed was my iPad and a beer and then I could just work wherever I happened to be.

266
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
 And nevertheless, I was kind of working all of the time.

267
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,080
 So, it was kind of...

268
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,280
 I had brilliant, I should say, I had four areas ahead to my four areas.

269
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,840
 They all did their jobs fantastically well.

270
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,720
 And I didn't necessarily need to do all of that, but nevertheless,

271
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,880
 you find yourself being very busy all the time.

272
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,960
 So, I haven't really seen programme, but I was...

273
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,920
 And then, by about lunchtime, I'll find out, something's saying,

274
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,720
 "Oh, that looks really good, but I'll catch it on catch up."

275
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
 I mean, this is one of these...

276
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,800
 This is like your dog's guns, who have happy fears,

277
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,600
 to play in happy fields, lie, comforting lies that we tell ourselves.

278
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,160
 Because we've got catch up and I have a list of about 35 items I really

279
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,600
 want to see on catch up.

280
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,440
 I'm not sure what's going to happen, you know?

281
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
 I might see what I'll do.

282
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,280
 You're in the committee. Surely you're in charge of determining how long things stay on catch up?

283
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,240
 I personally would...

284
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
 Okay, so I think...

285
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
 I'll be told we can now say till the end of the month, we think...

286
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,280
 What was the case?

287
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,240
 What was the case?

288
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,360
 Yeah, no, I think...

289
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
 Like I told me this morning, I think, that we can now say...

290
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,840
 We can't...

291
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,760
 There's a kind of not definitely about it, because there's a piece of work to be done

292
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,280
 that may not be very easy to do immediately after the convention,

293
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,480
 when you think about it.

294
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,040
 They explained to me a couple of times,

295
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
 "Intention is that you'll have until the end of April."

296
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,880
 Okay, that's good.

297
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
 I don't think that's like an official production yet.

298
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,760
 So we've been saying all we can at least a few days.

299
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,200
 But it doesn't matter, it doesn't...

300
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,560
 I mean, they could have just on catch up till the end of time,

301
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,560
 and I would never catch up everything, because you go away.

302
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,360
 But I'm expecting to have a few days just like around lockdown,

303
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
 but I'm not sure if you know something I might get to see,

304
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
 or catch up with you.

305
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Now, I want to watch the...

306
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
 I want to watch the Andor panel.

307
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,480
 I missed that, because I was at a conflicting item.

308
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,400
 I want to watch the overshoot panel.

309
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,240
 I want to watch Desot Island Books.

310
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,280
 I want to watch...

311
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,680
 I want to watch Carrie's session,

312
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,320
 which I was conflicted with,

313
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,400
 a convoy, because I did not spend Friday at the East Conquempo.

314
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,920
 I missed all of Friday.

315
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,520
 What were you doing, John?

316
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,440
 I was at Star Wars Celebration, running around like a giant nerd.

317
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,720
 And it was great.

318
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,520
 And...

319
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,880
 Were you wearing cosplay?

320
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
 Have you got a picture of your cosplay for the chat?

321
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,520
 Erm...

322
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,080
 Yes, probably, somewhere.

323
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 I might do that in a minute when I'm not talking,

324
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,880
 so that I can not try and do two things at once.

325
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,080
 Because whenever I try and do two things at once on the podcast,

326
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
 it goes back to me and then I edit it out.

327
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,400
 But I can't edit it out when it's live.

328
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,520
 Yeah, sometimes it'll be a pause.

329
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,480
 It's just like,

330
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,280
 "Oh, John's gone to look something up, hasn't he?"

331
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,760
 Yep.

332
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,520
 And he's not a multitasker.

333
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,400
 Nope.

334
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,160
 I'm a single track man.

335
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,880
 You want some more, um, exclusives?

336
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,120
 The first 10 items of the convention are now available on catch-up.

337
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,080
 Yes, James Shields posted it in the...

338
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,880
 I think he announced it in the chat for this podcast,

339
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,120
 which is, I mean, it's very good.

340
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,320
 Um...

341
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,480
 JT, rather than James Shields.

342
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,080
 I thought, oh, maybe.

343
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,720
 Oh, I don't know.

344
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,520
 Oh, no, maybe James.

345
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,920
 Anyway, Ed and Bob confirmed for catch-up,

346
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,480
 and we've got some items live on...

347
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,440
 Yeah, so...

348
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,320
 You will be...

349
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,960
 I would say the program would be so amazing at this convention.

350
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
 And the streaming speed is so amazing

351
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,440
 that we normally act convention as you get

352
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,520
 from endless complaints if the catch-up isn't available very quickly.

353
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
 And for this convention, we have not had any.

354
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,080
 And the reason for that is that the program is so good

355
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,720
 that there's always something that people want to be watching right now

356
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,200
 or scrolling back to see from the same day.

357
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,440
 Nobody's like, oh, no, it's tragic that I can't see something yesterday.

358
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,120
 Or if they are saying that, they are not saying that on Discord or social media.

359
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,080
 And if they're not saying a top Discord or social media,

360
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
 are they really saying it at all?

361
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,480
 I was going to say we also had the BSA awards,

362
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,080
 which I think we know, we noted when the nominations were announced.

363
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,880
 Yes.

364
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
 But the winners were on Ravela by Francis Harding for Best Book for Year and Agreeders.

365
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,520
 I let the bowdard for Best Short Fiction.

366
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,680
 Best Non-Fiction was Terry Pratchett, a life with Footnotes by Rob Wilkins.

367
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,680
 Best Artist was Alissa Winans for Red Scholars Wake.

368
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,640
 And Best Novel was City of Last Chances by Agent Tchaikovsky.

369
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,720
 He was also a guest who wasn't at this convention.

370
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
 So that Aishim was very, very nice,

371
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
 him to win midway through the convention.

372
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,680
 Yes.

373
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,920
 And I now need to go and read City of Last Chances

374
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,040
 being one of the Tchaikovsky novels of this year that I have not got to.

375
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,640
 Have you read the other three?

376
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
 Nope. I've read one.

377
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,640
 Which one did you read?

378
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,760
 The final architecture one, Ayes of the Void.

379
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,360
 Okay.

380
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
 And I got children memory on my To Be Read list,

381
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,160
 but otherwise, like 10% of my reading could be fulfilled entirely through

382
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,880
 Agent Tchaikovsky novels, and I feel there's like an upper limit.

383
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,960
 And I'm probably not going to read the Warhammer one.

384
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,360
 Sad.

385
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,440
 The Warhammer Eurasia from me.

386
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,800
 I've read half of City of Last Chances, which is very good.

387
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,000
 I was last to interview Adrian.

388
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,880
 Must have been two or three weeks ago.

389
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,440
 And his quenix did typography.

390
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,400
 And so I read as widely as I could in the time I had.

391
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,920
 B.S. is very good.

392
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,120
 I have not read any of the others.

393
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,960
 I'm assuming that the Rob Wilkins will be on the Hugo Ballot.

394
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,000
 So I do need to read that.

395
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,800
 And I need to read all of them because they all look good.

396
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,960
 They're all good award winners, Brent.

397
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,560
 B.S.

398
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,040
 Hara.

399
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,320
 Congratulations to all the winners.

400
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,080
 Yeah, and "Unraveler" by Francis Harding is very good as are basically all Francis Harding novels.

401
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,880
 And at some point, you will discover what John and Alison thought of the Francis Harding novel.

402
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,320
 I made them read for "Shattering".

403
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,160
 And I assume that will also be on the load start ballot this year or close to?

404
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,120
 Possibly, possibly.

405
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,680
 B.S.

406
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,200
 It arrived from the library on Thursday.

407
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,560
 After I'd arrived at the convention, I got the thing saying, you have "Unraveler" is it?

408
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,720
 On your Kindle to read, on your COVID read.

409
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,640
 So I'm really looking forward to the day when I get to read books again.

410
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,880
 Which might be quite soon because I'm planning to spend some time holding up not doing very much over the next few days.

411
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,560
 No, that's actually not a bad shout.

412
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,200
 And then there was an Easter combid session.

413
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,320
 Yeah, I didn't go to that.

414
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,240
 I sort of went to the end because I was on, there was something else.

415
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,480
 There's a lot of clashes at this convention.

416
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,440
 It's been slightly...

417
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,480
 I mean, I think that is part of having 90 minutes lots is that you end up with slightly fewer slots

418
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,000
 and slightly more clashes.

419
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,040
 Yes.

420
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,880
 But there have been quite a lot of times.

421
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,040
 It's like, I want to do only three things in this slot.

422
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,920
 And then the next slot, I don't necessarily want to go to any of them.

423
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,640
 But I guess that's...

424
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 I think they get to eat.

425
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,080
 Eating good.

426
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,160
 But yes, the big session.

427
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,880
 It was good.

428
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,960
 Bellfast is going to be the site of the 2025 Eastercon.

429
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,760
 The registrations are up.

430
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,480
 I remember.

431
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,320
 I did like the spoof.

432
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
 I wasn't there for the spoof.

433
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
 I heard.

434
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,720
 OK, so there was a spoof bid from Catastrophe.

435
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,280
 Space leopards will eat your face,

436
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,400
 which I believe to have something to do with Funcon,

437
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,360
 who I think I like to plug because I'm definitely going to Funcon.

438
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,640
 And I want to say that it's like awful,

439
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,760
 like a Shepherdsen Rotess or the stage in Illustra.

440
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,560
 I'm not sure it is.

441
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,840
 I think it might be somewhere else,

442
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,480
 but I'm really looking forward to Funcon one next year.

443
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,400
 And they did quite a funny bid where the premise of the bid

444
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,240
 was that they would go to hold convention in Ikea.

445
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,280
 And they were going to have a very large number of space leopards,

446
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
 which will probably not eat your face.

447
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,480
 And it was pretty funny.

448
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,360
 And they did not win, but they came quite close.

449
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,560
 Funcon isn't Buxton.

450
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,800
 It is in the Palace Hotel Buxton,

451
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,360
 which regular listeners will know is the site of Novocon.

452
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,240
 And so that's actually basically like it even more

453
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
 because I love the Palace Hotel Buxton

454
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,480
 because it is one of these grand old hotels.

455
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,920
 It is monumentally shabby,

456
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,440
 but has a lot of sofas.

457
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,120
 It is very much what I like in a hotel.

458
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,080
 It would be nice if there was more than one train to Buxton.

459
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,520
 There is more than one train to Buxton.

460
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,040
 There's a train every couple of hours.

461
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,440
 But there is only one of them.

462
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,240
 It just goes backwards.

463
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,280
 It goes back and forth between Buxton and Sheffield.

464
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,040
 I'm pretty sure it's one track.

465
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,360
 So I assume it does genuinely go backwards and forth.

466
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,640
 Yeah, I think it's one of these trades

467
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,840
 where the driver holds a key.

468
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,960
 It has to hand it to the...

469
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,640
 Yeah, it has to have a track.

470
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,160
 But yes, no, should be good.

471
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,200
 Have you bought your Bellfast membership, Alison and Liz?

472
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,880
 So I have bought a Bellfast membership,

473
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,680
 but I wish to be the non-fun one on the podcast and say,

474
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,720
 I have almost no tolerance for spoofed bids.

475
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,280
 Because unless they're incredibly funny

476
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
 and take like two minutes,

477
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,880
 most of the time I'm just like,

478
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,480
 you are taking up time at the bid session,

479
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
 which is generally pretty long.

480
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,680
 And usually what I want to do is do the bid session

481
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,280
 and go and watch some of the programme.

482
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,760
 So I did not see the fun con one,

483
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,680
 so it may have been absolutely great.

484
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,920
 But really you should be like two minutes and then you're off.

485
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,200
 They were a little bit longer than two minutes.

486
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,560
 They could have typed the hub a little bit.

487
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,080
 Pretty funny and have good presentation.

488
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,040
 And it's good to have the questions

489
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,840
 because it takes some of the attention off the questions

490
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,960
 because you get to...

491
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
 You'll ask the convention,

492
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,440
 you'll ask a serious question to Bellfast

493
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
 because then you'll ask a silly question.

494
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,600
 And also, Toby and James did a bit of a bit

495
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,480
 where they were kind of like,

496
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,160
 "Oh yeah, we can't compete.

497
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,760
 We're just going to give up.

498
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,720
 Well done folks."

499
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,520
 Well done, well done.

500
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,560
 Oh, catastrophe.

501
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,920
 I hope it's a great Easter time.

502
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,520
 That's not pretty funny.

503
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,560
 And they're guests.

504
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,000
 They're going to have guests.

505
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,200
 Oh, they're fantastic guests.

506
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,280
 I'm going to get to start with the end first

507
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,560
 because Ian McDonald,

508
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,120
 who I've spent quite a lot of time with in the bar

509
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,160
 with this weekend and also last weekend at Corflove,

510
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,480
 Ian McDonald is their bar guest of all that.

511
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,760
 Yes, so it's interesting.

512
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,720
 It's amazing.

513
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,440
 And this actually, I was going to leave this to last,

514
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,800
 but he's the first person to be

515
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,720
 an East Congestor one or three times.

516
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,560
 Some people get very cross about repeat

517
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,320
 because East Congestor's a runner.

518
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,760
 But I think probably it was.

519
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,520
 I'm still very excited because he was often in black

520
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,280
 and he's so much fun in the bar.

521
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,040
 No, I think, and I think,

522
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,600
 I was talking to James Bacon and he very reasonably said

523
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,040
 it would have been weird to have the Bellfast East Collin

524
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,280
 not have him involved in some big way.

525
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,040
 So that seems fair.

526
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
 The other guests are Lauren Duker,

527
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,920
 Sterek Landy, Jeanette Ng, Rebecca Rowanhorse,

528
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,720
 and William Simpson, which is a very good slate.

529
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,480
 I'm particularly excited about Rebecca Rowanhorse

530
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,240
 because she wrote a Star Wars novel.

531
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,280
 So that's pretty good.

532
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,080
 And also other things that were nominated for awards and stuff,

533
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,840
 but mostly Star Wars.

534
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,000
 Yeah, but I mean, we've got the name Toastmaster

535
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,040
 that the world cons use, that they could have actually used,

536
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
 they could have found a way to say,

537
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,160
 "Oh no, we're not giving ear the third bite of the cherry,

538
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,280
 no matter how."

539
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,840
 Because he actually has that combination of being

540
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,080
 an incredibly brilliant writer

541
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,160
 who is also hilariously fun, adding really nice guy.

542
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,960
 And this is why people keep having him back.

543
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
 You can't blame them, can you?

544
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,640
 Oh no, I mean, yeah, I think that's fair.

545
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:16,960
 I mean-

546
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,560
 They could call him Toastmaster or something like that.

547
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,440
 But I think that's why they say bar, guess what,

548
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,320
 they understand-

549
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,160
 If I have learned one thing reading,

550
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,640
 the Discord reaction to the Discord channel

551
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
 being called business meeting,

552
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,160
 is that you absolutely cannot import terms from the world con

553
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,640
 without anyone having an absolute shit fit.

554
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,040
 So I think I need to do fundamentally disagree with you on that.

555
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,320
 I need a sign that says this TVH.

556
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,880
 Okay, so I have some-

557
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
 So regular listeners will know this,

558
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,400
 I've had a really hard couple of months,

559
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,680
 and as a result of that,

560
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,920
 there were a load of times over the last couple of months

561
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,520
 that normally at this stage, at least,

562
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,720
 because I was off the committee on it,

563
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,760
 be kind of looking-

564
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,120
 I know it wouldn't be my area,

565
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,520
 but I'd kind of be getting my nose into different areas

566
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,640
 of convention going,

567
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,800
 do you really mean to be doing that?

568
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,640
 And it's kind of just not like that time.

569
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,160
 So I didn't get the chart,

570
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,680
 I didn't notice that until people started saying,

571
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,440
 why have you called this the business meeting?

572
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,720
 It's the mid-session,

573
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
 which we call it like 100% agree with.

574
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,840
 It's absolutely the mid-session,

575
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,800
 but we ended up changing it to mid-session and business meeting

576
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,040
 so that people who thought it was called

577
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,880
 the business meeting wouldn't be confused.

578
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,320
 Yes, fair enough.

579
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,960
 And you know, there's a lot of stuff that happens

580
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,240
 that isn't bidding, for instance,

581
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,400
 I don't think Belfast talked very much about hybrid,

582
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,440
 sorry, I had the arts in question.

583
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,840
 So you need to do it, right?

584
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,200
 When you read comments off the Discord,

585
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,880
 you need to make it clear that you're reading them

586
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,240
 and then reacting to them,

587
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,880
 because firstly, not everyone will be monitoring the Discord.

588
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,080
 But secondly, some people,

589
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,320
 and I know that this is not something we're used to

590
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,480
 having only done 80 previous episodes,

591
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,320
 will listen to this afterwards.

592
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,160
 And so it's important that they have enough context

593
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,680
 to understand what is happening,

594
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
 which now we don't always have a great job.

595
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,560
 So I have huge confidence about your ability to edit.

596
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,800
 Every time I listen, because every,

597
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,600
 okay, I'm going to do a bit of...

598
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
 You can't butcher them up like that

599
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,160
 to cover up your own mistakes.

600
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,960
 John, John, can we have a bit of...

601
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,520
 Can I tip that out?

602
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,560
 You don't have a bit of behind the curtain music.

603
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
 So I'm going to do a bit of behind the curtain stuff,

604
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,080
 which is actually Sunday morning.

605
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
 We get to like two hours after we start,

606
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,680
 and I'm like, okay, well, we're stopping now.

607
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,960
 And that's, we were completely incoherent

608
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
 for the entire morning.

609
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,000
 How on earth is John going to edit this?

610
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,320
 And then every Tuesday night where we get the end,

611
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,840
 I'm like, oh no, that's not supposed to happen.

612
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,120
 - But that doesn't mean you do...

613
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,080
 - You're too coherent.

614
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,600
 - You can't, but it is nice if you don't deliberately

615
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,480
 make it harder though.

616
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,640
 - I'm not deliberately making part.

617
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,560
 I'm tragically struck down with plague.

618
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,080
 - Fair enough.

619
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,240
 And the plague is called ADHD.

620
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,200
 Bridget asked in the chat, did Belfast talk about their virtual

621
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,480
 or hybrid plans.

622
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,360
 I think they basically said it would be kind of something

623
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
 they talked about more when they had a better idea of resources.

624
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,200
 And they were very keen on people joining early.

625
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,040
 So I think it might be a case that the earlier they know what they're...

626
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,600
 Because there's never been an Eastcon in Belfast, right?

627
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,120
 And so we have no real idea how big it will be.

628
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,280
 It might be, it could be anywhere between 400 and like 1000.

629
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,840
 And that's a very big range.

630
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,800
 And so I would not be surprised if the reason that they've set their membership rate

631
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,440
 sort of quite low initially is to try and work out what their numbers will actually be

632
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
 so that they can actually plan.

633
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,480
 So if you are planning to go and you have the means,

634
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,440
 I know not everyone is lucky enough to be able to just immediately

635
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,120
 spring 60 quid on a convention.

636
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,080
 But if you are planning to go and you do find yourself in that situation,

637
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,920
 then I would encourage you to join.

638
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,040
 Because I do think, I mean, and we've discussed this previously,

639
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,600
 but I do think it's important that Belfast be part of the Eastcon conversation

640
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,400
 as, I mean, one of the four constituent blobs.

641
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,680
 And I think they said their rates would go up end of May.

642
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,640
 So join early, join often?

643
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,360
 Join often.

644
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,600
 So I haven't gotten fact joined to the convention yet,

645
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,400
 because did I mention very, very busy and also play?

646
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,960
 But I would have done, have they not said,

647
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
 "Oh, we're not going to raise rates till the end of May."

648
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,960
 So it will be something I do open next month of May,

649
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
 because indeed it's important to join early.

650
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,280
 I think one of the things we're going to see is that many of the virtual

651
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,880
 members of this convention have come in in the last couple of weeks before the

652
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,400
 call, which is kind of what we expected.

653
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,600
 But we weren't sure whether it would happen because of the,

654
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,240
 because this is a fairly expensive virtual convention.

655
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,120
 It's not like a convention where we're like,

656
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,160
 "Well, pay a five, pay a five, if you want to be okay."

657
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,520
 Obviously all of the magic stuff that we've been doing on streaming,

658
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
 and that's allowed me to be here, for example,

659
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,960
 because, you know, for most Eastcon's for most time,

660
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,040
 if I call COVID halfway through the convention,

661
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,920
 I would not be the only further in further panels.

662
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,520
 All of that stuff's quite expensive, but it's very exciting.

663
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,680
 And I think there's a lot of will to do it,

664
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,800
 but there's also this question about what is actually practical and sensible.

665
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,720
 And we don't have to look at, you know, how,

666
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,960
 how many virtual members we have and how many,

667
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,720
 how many is actually spent time online,

668
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,360
 and then that's information to go forward.

669
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,000
 I believe the tech need for 2025 is JT.

670
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,080
 I don't know if anyone in the room can confirm that.

671
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,520
 JT, wave, if that's true, he's nodding sadly.

672
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,360
 So, yes, I want to say two things,

673
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,360
 which is firstly, Meg Mcdonald notes that Glasgow in 2024

674
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,040
 has a rate rise at the start of May.

675
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,800
 So join that first if you've not already,

676
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,760
 because they also need to know how many people are having.

677
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,560
 Yeah, I'm kind of an arbodillo member of 2024 or whatever it's called.

678
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,880
 And also we have to have a live update,

679
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,200
 which is we have now doubled our number of attending guests of honour,

680
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,120
 as Neil Harrison has arrived from his previous panel owing to us over running.

681
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,720
 And I don't know if we've mentioned it,

682
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,880
 but you can buy his new book,

683
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,680
 All These Worlds Reviews and Essays by Neil Harrison from all good book shops.

684
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,080
 You know, I hate it when you're in a panel of all over the books.

685
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,240
 Just go and re-enact him with 15 quid,

686
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,600
 and I think he would be really happy not to take all these books home.

687
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,040
 Yes. And also maybe you start chanting his name, but like quietly.

688
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:20,480
 Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil.

689
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,560
 He's hidden under a table, ladies and gentlemen.

690
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,240
 We've done it, he's under the table.

691
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,920
 Have we ever been under the table?

692
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,840
 Because he doesn't drink, so this might be new.

693
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,800
 I think many of us have, but yes.

694
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,640
 So I can't help but notice it's a 1440 one,

695
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,960
 which means we're 11 minutes past the end of our slot.

696
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,920
 And while I don't mind, there are people in the audience

697
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,160
 who have to go to the closing ceremony.

698
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,920
 I would quite like to go to the closing ceremony.

699
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
 So shall we do pics?

700
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,280
 What, in like?

701
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,680
 Yes.

702
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,480
 In two minutes?

703
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,120
 Go.

704
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,600
 Go, Liz.

705
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,200
 You can pick first.

706
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,360
 You put me in a printable spot,

707
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,640
 I assume that we were running solo.

708
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,400
 We would not do pics.

709
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,840
 All right, I think it's a film, it's called No Sebo.

710
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,800
 It is, I believe, a joint production of the Irish and Philippine film industries.

711
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,120
 It is a horror film starring Eva Green about a woman who,

712
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,000
 she's a fashion designer, she gets some unpleasant news on a phone call.

713
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,720
 And we see her being attacked by a mysterious dog.

714
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,200
 And then we flash forward eight months when she's having many unexplained symptoms.

715
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,560
 And a Filipino woman arrives at her home and says, yes, I am the helper

716
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
 that you arrange to come and visit.

717
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,000
 And then from then on, it's one of these films where it's like, okay, so how much of this is

718
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,520
 actually supernatural?

719
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,600
 How much of this is just kind of a woman who is ill and everything is being presented in the

720
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,640
 worst possible light?

721
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,120
 It is about colonialism, it is about capitalism.

722
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,960
 I think it is quite an interesting little low budget film.

723
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,160
 And it's worth going out and watching.

724
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,280
 Liz.

725
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,960
 Alison, have you read or experienced anything?

726
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:10,080
 Yeah, no, my pick this week is plague because there's nothing like the notion that my favourite

727
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,120
 weekend of the year is always going to come with ill that's immediately up with.

728
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,480
 And I mean, to be fair, I've been coming to East Coast for this is my,

729
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,480
 it's not quite my 40th Eastacom but I got into family in 1983.

730
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,240
 So my first Eastacom was 1984, it's nearly 40 years.

731
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,800
 And I have actually got away from Eastacom with some former villas on all those occasions.

732
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,040
 It's just now we're paying attention.

733
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,400
 So yes, I play.

734
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,560
 It's given me a great chance to experience the Convention virtually,

735
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,560
 which I have not really taken advantage of because I've been too busy running around doing

736
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,360
 commission things.

737
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,720
 I'm looking forward to the rest of the charts to read some books and play some video games

738
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,040
 and watch the call on catch up.

739
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,680
 Recommended 10 out of 10 with plague again.

740
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,520
 Alison's opinions do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the wider old thought post-ship.

741
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,600
 Yes, sir.

742
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,120
 I am going to pick Adrian Tchaikovsky as a man.

743
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,800
 So because I had to read an enormous amount of his book quite quickly.

744
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,840
 I kind of read four of his novels back to back to back to back.

745
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,280
 And the thing that made me realize is he firstly, he is very good,

746
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,880
 which I did already know.

747
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,640
 But the thing that really crystallized it in my head is reading four novels,

748
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,920
 all of which are hugely different in tone, in ideas, in their approach.

749
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,320
 Like the final architecture series is much more action driven.

750
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,880
 And then you have like children of time and children of ruin,

751
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,200
 which are much more kind of like cerebral, if you're like.

752
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,280
 And then you have the Tyranid book he wrote for James Lottachop, which is amazing.

753
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
 And just very, very good.

754
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,400
 And then you have City Last Chances, which is also brilliant.

755
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,120
 And it's just, yeah, it's really good.

756
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,000
 And I'm not, he's just very, he's just very good.

757
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,960
 This is incisive criticism in the "harrisonian mold."

758
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,080
 I will say, Neil, just before we do wrap up, you weren't here for this.

759
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,600
 But I did just, I went out the way, Alison Liz John Alison.

760
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,120
 And I remarked to the audience that this is an example of an overshoot structure.

761
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,680
 As proposed by you and your essay.

762
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,480
 You'd go, "Hello, this is the Oxford on cast and I've Alison Scott.

763
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,040
 I'm on Cox and I've been back here and I've Alison Scott."

764
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,200
 I'll edit that in.

765
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,960
 But for now, thank you very much to the audience for coming.

766
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,000
 I'm sorry we started late.

767
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,320
 Will we go to ask any audience questions?

768
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,640
 We don't have time to ask any audience questions.

769
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,960
 There has to be a closing ceremony.

770
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,080
 They should have put them in the discord instead of chatting among themselves.

771
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,200
 Yeah, audience.

772
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,400
 How dare you have fun.

773
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,200
 But yes, thank you so much.

774
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,120
 You've got loads of questions in the discord.

775
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,560
 Thank you so much to everyone for coming.

776
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,280
 We really appreciate it.

777
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,480
 It's all you lovely to see everyone.

778
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,080
 And yes, thank you very much to my co-host Alison and Liz as well.

779
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,000
 And thank you again to Tech, who are amazing.

780
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:11,040
 That was the "Orr to Thor" podcast.

781
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,320
 And I'm John Coxin.

782
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,280
 I'm Alison Scott.

783
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,720
 And I'm Liz Batty.

784
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,640
 Oh, he has to be that.

785
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,920
 He means goodbye to me.

786
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,000
 That's my new podcast.

787
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,160
 We've only done 81.

788
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,200
 B.

789
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,160
 B.

790
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,880
 We've only done 81 episodes.

791
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,160
 It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me and I'll have a bye.
