 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 74th episode of Octothorpe, the podcast of eldritch

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:25,520
 poetry, which is coming to you on the 5th of January 2023. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,000
 Scott. And today we have something a little bit different for you. We asked you for poetry

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,880
 and Sandra Bond has delivered! She has sent us this lovely pastiche, thanks very much Sandra.

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,320
 And I'm not sure we can do it justice but we'll have a go.

6
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,640
 There's an intriguing Lovecraftian hellscape where fumes make the fetid air glum: And Alison

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,400
 Scott and Liz Batty went there with John Coxon, their son.

8
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,720
 A broth of a boy was young Coxon, all dressed in his best like a swell and he carried a

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,960
 plastic lightsaber, the best one that Woolworths could sell. They didn't much rate that dimension,

10
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,440
 though the angles looked wonky and wrong, and Alison thought her accordion sounded better

11
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,920
 than Dagon's old song.

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,720
 So seeking for further amusement they paid to go into the zoo, where they'd shoggoths and

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,160
 deep ones and serpents, not to mention Almighty Cthulhu.

14
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,920
 Now Cthulhu was peaceful and passive, his tentacles twitched as he slept, he lay in a

15
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,600
 somnolent posture, as he dreamed of the secrets he kept.

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 John Coxon had heard about Cthulhu, his unspeakable nature and that, and it made him a tad disappointed,

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,520
 an Elder God, lying there flat.

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,160
 So Coxon, he took his lightsaber, like Skywalker or one of those, and ere Alison or Liz could

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,240
 stop him, he shoved it up great Cthulhu's nose.

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:19,040
 It was certain that Cthulhu di'n't like it, for giving a kind of a roll, he opened his

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 cavernous mouthpiece, and vacuumed out John Coxon's soul.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,600
 And Alison fled with a gibber, and Liz she fled too, with a wail, and they dragged little

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,200
 Coxon behind them, like a Tindalos hound with its tail.

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,400
 They made it out of that dimension, which I think is more than they deserved, and decided

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,280
 to record a podcast about all the things they'd observed.

26
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,160
 And Octothorpe came out as normal, and it's pretty good fun on the whole, but the funny

27
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,160
 thing is that John Coxon seems to get on just fine with no soul.

28
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:16,840
