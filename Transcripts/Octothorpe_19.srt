1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 I'm going to eat a quarter of shit.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,400
 Well, that's the cold open.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:25,800
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 19th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom. I'm John Coxon.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,600
 I'm Alison Scott.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,200
 And I'm Liz Betty.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,000
 We're tired.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,680
 I'm not dead though.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,680
 That's good.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,080
 You're not dead.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,920
 No.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:46,120
 Contrary to rumors that were propagated by a trio of degenerates at a closing ceremony for a recent convention, Liz lives.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,320
 We thought it was funny.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,760
 It was funny, but we were sleeved deprived and had been drinking.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,000
 It was funny.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,240
 I just want to, you know, set any rumors to bed.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:05,480
 I think we did clarify immediately because I think at the point where we put up that photo and said we're going to take a moment to remember Liz.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,000
 Some people in our audience might have actually been shocked for a few seconds.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,160
 So we did.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,880
 We did want to correct that impression very fast.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,600
 Yeah, we are great.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,760
 We have had letters of comment.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,880
 So we will start with a letter to comment.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:33,000
 Firstly, Claire Breyerley from Croydon collected her point for her house by correctly identifying the reference.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,240
 And Claire Breyerley from Croydon also sent me 108 weetabix.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,120
 So I must now take a bath with them.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,200
 In them.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
 Will this be?

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,720
 No, no, I can't.

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,080
 I can't hollow them out.

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,800
 I can make them into a bath.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,120
 I'm not just for the record.

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,280
 I'm not making a bath out of weebix categorically, though.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,480
 I think that would be a very special, very niche fanzying, John.

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:08,560
 I also think that after plotters investigations into the efficacy of chocolate teapots,

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,680
 you might find that the efficacy of weetabix baths is not that great.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,840
 And that at the point where you put a liquid into your weetabix bath, it would do the

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,440
 weetabix thing and you would then just kind of have a pile of mush.

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,560
 Yeah, I mean, that that is one of the myriad of reasons that I am not going to make about

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
 our weebix.

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,280
 It is true.

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,440
 Liz looks.

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,760
 I am very sad listener that you can't see Liz's face.

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,640
 Have you just exchanged myriad for plethora in your vocabulary now, John?

44
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,520
 Yes, because you kept telling me off for losing plethora.

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,280
 I think any members of the Octo-thorpe audience who would like John to take a bath in weetabix

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,080
 should definitely write to us and let John know how ardently they desire to see him taking a bath in weetabix.

47
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,920
 I'm going to take a bath with my I'm going to take a bath with my weetabix.

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,400
 That is going to happen in his Star Wars underpants.

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,640
 Sorry.

50
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,120
 I could not say that without corpseing.

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,880
 I need to say it again with with without corpseing.

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,240
 I think you corpseing makes the point wonderfully.

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,880
 In his Star Wars underpants.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,400
 At least now we've got the episode title.

55
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
 So that's good.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,880
 You've got it both ways.

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,120
 And now, of course, you need to mention the the lock on the convention that mentioned

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,680
 that which you're probably going to do anyway.

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,800
 We were not actually recording at the point where you said that no, well, I think it was it observed your

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,680
 Star Wars underpants in your convention zoom background, which feels like a comment on the

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,440
 convention.

62
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,720
 Oh, I thought you said no one spotted them.

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,440
 No one noticed.

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
 No, all didn't notice.

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,880
 Unless you did know all if you're listening right in.

66
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,480
 I'm just going to watch.

67
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,320
 We're going to have to use a screenshot from the YouTube on.

68
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,000
 Yeah, basically every every panel or program item I did at punctuation.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,560
 There was a pair of my Star Wars underpants drying on my radiator in my room that I zoom from.

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,080
 And so yeah, if you were an eagle-eyed viewer, you may have noticed my apparel.

71
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,480
 Adorning my my view, but you know, they're dry now.

72
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,400
 So they're in the airing cupboard because you put dry things in a warm cupboard to make sure I think.

73
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,880
 I don't have an airing cupboard, but I mean, effectively, I could say live in a giant airing cupboard.

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,680
 So I mean, I've never heard anyone call title.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,200
 I was going for the same joke, but I'll have to be to it.

76
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,040
 Devoomtish.

77
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,320
 Claire also criticizes by use of the word onboarding.

78
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,600
 And I promise to immediately deplane my use of that word.

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,200
 Oh, what was wrong with your use of the word onboarding?

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,400
 I don't think Claire thinks it's a real word.

81
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,280
 Oh, well, that's because Claire is an old person.

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,880
 Oh, boarding is clearly a real word.

83
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,840
 It works.

84
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,000
 Everyone knows what it means.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,840
 It's if we were onboarding people to the convention.

86
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,360
 Tech stack.

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,480
 My plan, my plan, my future plans going forward is not to use the word onboarding again.

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,000
 Going forward is also on the list of, of, I know, English phrases that old people don't like.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,240
 As is forward planning.

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,200
 Oh, well, forward planning is actually an oxen moral, isn't it?

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,880
 Because you're right.

92
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,800
 Yes.

93
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,880
 Because you probably shouldn't spend any time backward planning and and yeah, forward planning is just planning.

94
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,000
 But it but it's like these people don't understand the use of adjectives to provide emphasis.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,280
 They literally don't, John.

96
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,960
 Exactly.

97
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,600
 They literally don't.

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
 Which is odd because metaphorically they do.

99
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
 Um, right.

100
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,240
 So having safely ensured that we will get at least one letter of comment next episode,

101
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,000
 let's progress to the next one.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:04,760
 One letter of comment from Claire, like at 15 second intervals as she gets progressively more irate.

103
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,680
 I don't know.

104
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,160
 Maybe maybe she'll be distracted by the thought of you in a bath of wheat picks.

105
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,480
 We were onboarding her or attitude.

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,120
 Right.

107
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,720
 It's causing now, John.

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,760
 We got, we got an, we got a letter of comment.

109
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,080
 Helena McCallum said as a letter of comment saying regarding the punching game,

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,880
 if it was multiplayer, we could bring back the classic small phone convention gag of boxing.

111
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,280
 Helena, if VR didn't make her very ill.

112
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,480
 So, yeah, I don't know what that is.

113
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,400
 Do you know what that is, Alison?

114
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:50,320
 Um, if you had come to our panel item on small fund conventions and actually pop pickers,

115
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,280
 there's a few days to still watch our YouTube videos after this podcast goes live.

116
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,760
 But before we take them down, which we'll talk about at some point because I want to say

117
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,800
 something about captioning as well.

118
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,120
 So I'm actually anyway, if you'd gone to the item that we ran on small phone

119
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,240
 conventions at punctuation, John, you might have been a bit busy, but it's one of the ones

120
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,560
 that I have watched again, because we have the punctuation equivalent of iPlayer.

121
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,800
 Yes.

122
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,680
 A couple of weeks, which I really love because I never, there is no way on earth.

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,720
 I'd go to a panel at 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning in the real world, but I have now

124
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,560
 watched that panel and very thoroughly enjoyed it.

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,040
 And they did talk a little bit about Dan Feinkon, which was a convention I was at,

126
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 and which was one of the small fund conventions that happened, I think not necessarily

127
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,080
 ever made by holiday, but was a Twin Peaks themed convention.

128
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,480
 And it made a number of David Lynch jokes because Twin Peaks and because Twin Peaks

129
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,520
 was dotted itself funny enough to sustain an entire weekend, though it was pretty good.

130
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,120
 You know, there was a lot, we ran a back, Stephen and I ran a workshop at that

131
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,600
 convention on talking backwards, because that's a thing that Twin Peaks has quite a lot of.

132
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
 I am digressing and you did.

133
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,640
 Oh, because David Lynch also did a film called Boxing Helena, and they had somebody who

134
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,360
 was called Helena, which is quite close.

135
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,360
 They put her in a box as you do.

136
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,200
 Hey, now, I know what to say, though, I happen to have a chance to go back through

137
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,520
 the panels. There are several I do need to do that with, but I have basically the last

138
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,240
 week has been doing as little as possible.

139
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,960
 Yeah.

140
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,920
 So the other I do want to try and catch nearly everything.

141
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,840
 I've done about a third of them now.

142
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,520
 So bloody hell.

143
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,720
 Fair enough.

144
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,360
 I should watch that one, though.

145
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,600
 So I've been quite good.

146
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,800
 But that's because, remember, I have a job at which I need something to listen to.

147
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,000
 And while I'm working, which makes it.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,680
 We have a final letter of comment from Roman Orzansky, who writes with regards to

149
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,400
 setting lakes on fire.

150
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,240
 There are two clear reasons why you might not want to set a lake on fire.

151
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,720
 Firstly, Christina wouldn't like it.

152
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,880
 And secondly, it would set off an alarm bell if you did so.

153
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,680
 I would have thought that obvious.

154
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:20,200
 Surely Roman says I just liked I just liked the pun of set off and alarm bell and

155
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,640
 set off an alarm bell.

156
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
 I thought I was a good pun.

157
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
 So thank you, Roman.

158
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,560
 Yes, it was good.

159
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,080
 It's pretty good as far as funds go.

160
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,080
 It was in the fine tradition of puns.

161
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,800
 I like when I like when Liz, we should have a podcast, which is just Liz reviewing

162
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,360
 puns.

163
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,200
 Oh, God, can we please not have a podcast, which is me reviewing puns.

164
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:48,640
 I've heard some skanky explanations for why a podcast happens in my time, but that's

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,600
 pretty bad.

166
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,520
 Anyway, we do also have one more letter of comment, but it's a little bit.

167
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,160
 Well, I say we I have a letter of comment, which I'm going to talk about on the show

168
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,680
 because I can't talk about it in a fanzine.

169
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,360
 And that's because it was a letter of comment on my TAF report from Mark Plummer,

170
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,560
 who titled the email most John title imaginable, which is good.

171
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,400
 There is I very much enjoyed your letter.

172
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
 Thank you very much for writing it, Mark.

173
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,000
 But I will say my favourite line was I had completely forgotten that I had interviewed

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 you in Reno.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
 Indeed, I'm not sure I can remember it even now that you've reminded me.

176
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,080
 And rather the best I can hope for is that I will now remember that you told me I

177
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,680
 interviewed you and so it must have happened.

178
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,440
 And I like that.

179
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,360
 But yes, also, he pointed out a mistake I'd made at a text, which I might just leave

180
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,360
 in because it's all I don't know.

181
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,480
 But we'll see.

182
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,080
 So deliberate error.

183
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,800
 You're just checking to see if people are reading the report properly.

184
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,720
 Sort of.

185
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
 That's what a thing.

186
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,560
 And also just a note that you could buy by TAF Trip Report now.

187
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,000
 It's a Fiverr if you buy it from my website or it's about £20 if you buy it from Lulu.

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,280
 And then once you get it, you can put a word in from it as a discount code or website

189
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,160
 to get a free copy of the PDF, like one of the oldest structure manuals from a 1970s

190
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,760
 computer game.

191
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,040
 I was very proud.

192
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,240
 That's quite nifty.

193
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,600
 End of plug.

194
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,480
 Yeah.

195
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,720
 By John's TAF report, TAF reports are cool.

196
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,840
 Trip reports are cool.

197
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,240
 The fan funds are cool.

198
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,440
 Have we done anything recently to raise money for the fan funds, boys and girls?

199
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,480
 I finished my TAF report, Alison.

200
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,080
 We literally just talked about that.

201
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,200
 No, we ran a convention.

202
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,480
 Sorry, it was intended to be a segue, John.

203
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,040
 Oh, were we on?

204
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,600
 Were we onboarding people to the discussion about our convention?

205
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,920
 Segue.

206
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,800
 A segue is a term for an onboarding activity at a podcast.

207
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:55,720
 We ran a convention.

208
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,680
 It was good.

209
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,520
 I mean, it's going to be a while before I've got my energy back, I think.

210
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,120
 The committee all talking to each other still.

211
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,080
 I think that's right.

212
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,800
 We haven't checked with Steve.

213
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,560
 Yeah.

214
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,280
 Yeah.

215
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,040
 Steve, if you're not talking to us, please write in and let us know.

216
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,680
 If there's something we need to wrap up that you know about, you should get in touch.

217
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,280
 Yes, we need to.

218
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,560
 So we need to

219
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,000
 announce the results of the charity split.

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,720
 So we are giving our excess is going to

221
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,960
 effectively going to some charities and then also to fan funds and efforts to run

222
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,400
 more punctuations, if we decide that we want to do that.

223
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,280
 Alison will make me wash my mouth out with soap at this juncture.

224
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:54,160
 But we are dispersing our funds to the Good Things Foundation, shelter, the

225
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,360
 Stephen Lawrence Trust and the swad lifeline.

226
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:04,520
 Each each of us picked a cause and then we asked members to vote on the causes.

227
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,960
 And so we will be splitting the muddies between the charities in accordance with

228
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,560
 the percentages of the votes.

229
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,560
 And because we ran the convention in a very cheap skate sort of way, I think all of

230
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,080
 those are going to get a moderate amount of money because it turns out that it doesn't

231
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,400
 cost a fiver a head to run a convention in a very cheap skate way.

232
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
 Yes.

233
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
 Yeah.

234
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,200
 How much do you think it cost us?

235
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
 Oh, I know the answer to that.

236
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,960
 Yeah.

237
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,480
 Two little pounds give or take.

238
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,680
 OK.

239
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,400
 So all in all, I believe we spent 184 pounds and 15 p.

240
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,440
 That's all of the things that the committee put in the split wise.

241
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,400
 So if there's anything that isn't counted in there, we haven't yet got like the receipts

242
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,000
 together and stuff.

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,280
 But yeah, so under 200 pounds, we will eventually put out some sort of post con thing that

244
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,680
 details, you know, what we spent money on and kind of how we did things and why we did

245
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,640
 things and what people thought about the things we did.

246
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,440
 I was going to do this bright and early on the Monday after the convention, but it

247
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,240
 turns out I didn't want to.

248
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,800
 So I haven't yet.

249
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:22,520
 I love the fact that John, who had never run a convention before, was kind of after

250
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,240
 the con, we will do all these things.

251
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,040
 And everyone who had run a convention was what was like.

252
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,080
 Traditionally, this does not happen to the extent you think it will, though I have had

253
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,400
 less post con slow down after this convention than any other convention I have ever been

254
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,480
 involved in by miles.

255
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,920
 So I think that's quite good.

256
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,840
 I have done activities this week.

257
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,680
 I have not been that tired.

258
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,360
 I would have had less slow down except that I felt very ill on the Sunday night, which is

259
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,160
 in some ways very good because it means it was a proper convention, but in some ways

260
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,240
 it was a little bit of a pain because I did not want to feel very ill on the Sunday

261
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,600
 night.

262
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,360
 You wanted to stay up for partying till after Liz got up.

263
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,600
 Liz got up and then regretted having to go to work on Monday morning.

264
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
 I did.

265
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,160
 Liz, what did you think of our convention?

266
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,960
 I thought it went quite well.

267
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:22,000
 It was certainly much less work than running a 200 person convention in person would be

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,240
 because there was just a whole host of stuff we didn't have to bother about at all.

269
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,400
 I think it went relatively smoothly.

270
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,320
 I don't think we had, which I said, I don't think we had any reports to our listeners

271
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,400
 team that I know about.

272
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,720
 I don't think anyone came to the committee with any urgent problems.

273
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,120
 So in many ways running a two day convention online is much, much easier than running one

274
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,920
 in person.

275
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,520
 Not that I ever run a 200 person convention.

276
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,040
 I did just skip that phase and gone straight to big ones.

277
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,800
 200 people, 200 person conventions are reasonably chill in person, but obviously those 200

278
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,240
 individuals can have things go wrong in their lives over the course of the weekend that need

279
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,440
 the conventions attention and do sometimes.

280
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,800
 So there normally are things that do actually go wrong.

281
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 You would want you would want slightly more people.

282
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,280
 I think that I really noticed that when something did go wrong, you were kind of right at your

283
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,000
 desk in the place you could fix it.

284
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,680
 Whereas at a convention, it's very common that your committee members need to sort out a

285
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,400
 problem at the far end of the hotel.

286
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,280
 So so your problem solving consists of stopping what you're doing and going to a different

287
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,840
 place and then learning about the problem of dealing with it and then returning to where you

288
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,360
 were before at which point something else would have gone wrong.

289
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,040
 And I feel that we didn't really that when stuff got wrong, there was always a committee

290
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,640
 member right there at their desk ready to sort it out.

291
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,000
 That is extremely true.

292
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,160
 So for instance, when are you know, we're having a problem with the streaming solution, the

293
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,960
 solution is one of the committee logs in from their desk where they are and fixes it.

294
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,360
 It's not like if your projector breaks down, you have to go running around to find the

295
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,600
 three people who know where the spare projector bulbs are and change the bulb or whatever.

296
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,880
 It's more like, Oh, I'll just log in and oh yeah, it's running again.

297
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,520
 Fine. So yeah, it is a lot easier from that standpoint.

298
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,800
 People are very nice about the convention.

299
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,600
 Nobody was horrible about the convention.

300
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,800
 That's lovely.

301
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,840
 There are of course things we do differently next time.

302
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,480
 I think the biggest, I think our program was fine.

303
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,080
 But I think the biggest downside to the short lead time was that one of the things you

304
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,640
 could do with a longer lead time for a small convention is build interesting program that

305
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,120
 takes weeks or months to sort out.

306
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,240
 And I think that was harder for us and I think we could have, you know, you could do more

307
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,400
 in that space if you'd had more lead time.

308
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,800
 That's the only thing.

309
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,520
 I'm not sure you could do much more in the other ways by having a long lead time.

310
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,800
 But that thing I think you could have done.

311
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,040
 So I think, yeah, I think I think there are things we would do differently.

312
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:05,600
 I think next time the thing I would want to try and do is a better job of getting

313
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,440
 members information into the database we were using.

314
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,760
 That was not particularly trivial to do.

315
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,000
 And the way we took payments added a lot of work to our lives that was potentially

316
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,360
 not necessary and added stress.

317
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,320
 I will say that it reduced stress in the sense that the way we took payments meant

318
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,480
 that we didn't have to think about it, it just worked.

319
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
 And that was very nice.

320
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,840
 But what it did mean was that we got hardly any information, which then meant we had a

321
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,120
 lot more work to do in other aspects.

322
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,160
 I'm hopeful that there would be a way to have it just work with payments and have

323
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,800
 it just work with people filling in the membership form.

324
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,400
 But that will be something we investigate if we run another one.

325
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,960
 Well, stood, I think we could have done a little bit better.

326
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,440
 And I think we need to do, we might need to do like a couple of test panels

327
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,440
 next time for new wranglers because I was a little bit.

328
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,640
 I think there's no substitute for actually actually wrangling a real panel.

329
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,400
 We did do kind of workshops prior to the convention, but I think we perhaps needed

330
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,200
 to do more, more high stress workshops.

331
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
 That sounds like a weird thing to say.

332
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,480
 But I do wonder whether we needed to more thoroughly onboard our programme ops people.

333
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,960
 But yeah, but again, that's something we'd know for next time, I think.

334
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,320
 I can mention one that John mentioned, which was that John

335
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,000
 thought that having two versions of the air table programme was

336
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 wasn't perfect.

337
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,960
 And I kind of got what he said, but I'm not.

338
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,880
 I'm not sure I agree.

339
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,480
 I mean, I think I'm saying I'm sure I don't agree, but I think there's things we could do.

340
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,760
 We made the decision to use to publish the programme on air table very, very late

341
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,880
 because we'd be kind of looking at other solutions for printing a schedule.

342
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,320
 And they were all way complicated and cost money.

343
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,440
 I think that's that's not too strong a statement, is it?

344
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,280
 Liz or both way complicated or cost money or both.

345
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,200
 Yeah, I mean, it's not necessarily way complicated.

346
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,360
 It's more that if we are doing everything in the air table and then we have to take

347
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,920
 the data out of the air table and put it into whatever other scheduling thing we are using.

348
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,240
 Then as soon as you start making changes, you now have to update changes in two places

349
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,560
 and that becomes a massive hassle.

350
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,480
 You really want to have one central store.

351
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,280
 And since the air table was our working programme, it was trivial to update it.

352
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,000
 Whereas if we start having some kind of link from air table to shed, say, then we really

353
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,440
 need to start working there and changing everything there.

354
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
 And so that just changes your workflow.

355
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,200
 Also money.

356
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,320
 And I think we discovered very late that the basic output of air table was an

357
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,240
 adequate programme publication for a small convention.

358
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,920
 Again, that was not we didn't nobody said they hated it.

359
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,200
 So I think that was probably all right.

360
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
 I thought it worked very, very well.

361
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,160
 But the reason I thought the problem I thought it had was that I had conversation

362
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,520
 with two or three people through the weekend that they hadn't.

363
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,320
 They were not sure why when they went to the punctuation programme,

364
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,280
 sometimes it had the links to programme items and sometimes it didn't.

365
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,640
 And I think it's one of those things where I completely see it saved us at

366
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,360
 all for a lot of time.

367
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,960
 And I think I understand why we did it that way.

368
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,120
 But I think next time, I think I would want to only ever

369
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,240
 publicise the programme in places where only members could see it and maybe have

370
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,640
 like a kind of provisional programme on the website with a note saying this

371
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,080
 programme might not be up to date, please check for the most recent version in the

372
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,040
 discord, just because I think it was confusing to some people that there were

373
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,200
 two versions and it wasn't clear why there were two versions or how you got from

374
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,920
 one to the other.

375
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,800
 And the answer was you didn't, you had to go on the discord and find the other link.

376
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,720
 And I just, but it might have been that we could have communicated that better.

377
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,160
 It's just something I think we need to be aware of for next time that it could

378
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,800
 potentially be a point of pain.

379
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,600
 Yeah.

380
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,480
 So so my view is that the that having the online programme be correct all the time,

381
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,000
 which is what it was correct within tiny, tiny details, all of the time.

382
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:33,680
 Was so useful that that it made up for everything, made up for anything else.

383
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,080
 But it would be good to be able to embed the programme in a web page that said,

384
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,960
 note this version of the programme doesn't have the links to programme items.

385
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,560
 For that, you'll need to go to either your members email or or the discord to

386
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,960
 get the version that's got the links because that's a paywall is as far as we

387
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,360
 add. But I think having the whole programme on the web is quite good for

388
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,760
 people. It's obviously no link.

389
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,960
 That ties into what I think we could have done better, which is to have a website

390
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
 which had everything within it.

391
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,200
 So you join through our website, you can then log in and see the schedule and see

392
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,440
 the links and get a link to the discord, give us your member information, change

393
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,200
 member information, you know, just have one unified website.

394
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,520
 And basically, we didn't really have that because we just had a WordPress site,

395
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,240
 which was extremely easy for us to handle.

396
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,640
 We should say we just had a WordPress.com site.

397
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,720
 And what we probably should have had was a WordPress.org site.

398
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,240
 But by the time we worked out this, we discovered that you can't move your

399
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,840
 URL for 60 days after registering it.

400
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,720
 This is like one of these really technical things.

401
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,960
 Ironically, the thing is is proposing we should have done would have been much

402
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,520
 easier to do on a WordPress.com site than a WordPress.org site because WordPress.com

403
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,280
 provides you with all the tools because we were using the WordPress.com membership

404
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,160
 scheme. You can make pages that are only visible to members because WordPress.com

405
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,680
 is designed around that kind of workflow.

406
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,560
 Have we just had a slapping out forehead moment?

407
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,480
 No, I think it would have been it would have been so much more admin for

408
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,160
 though I think it would because the thing getting our program to people who were

409
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,280
 members was easy.

410
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,520
 It was it was having a second version of the program that was available to the

411
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,520
 public that was hard having members only pages on the website wouldn't have helped.

412
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,880
 I don't think that addresses the pain point I saw.

413
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,320
 OK, so maybe what you're saying is actually what we should have done is just

414
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,680
 had published the program, published the program once for the purposes of getting

415
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,000
 people into the convention.

416
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,440
 But then yeah, with a with a big banner saying like, please don't take this as

417
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,280
 the official program.

418
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,560
 This is just the advert.

419
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,360
 The official program is in the paywall because I think.

420
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,120
 But yeah, but I think these are all things.

421
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,400
 The our the reason we didn't do that with the website is because I think it would

422
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,400
 have added quite a bit of admin for not much gain.

423
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,040
 But I'd be keen to hear from people who disagreed and it's one of the questions

424
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,600
 I want to ask in my big feedback form.

425
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,160
 Oh, yes, that's what you were going to do this week.

426
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,760
 I remember.

427
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,600
 I am working on it exists.

428
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,360
 I think one of our key issues was we sent people to a lot of places like they went

429
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,240
 to the website to join and then they got a link to the discord to log in and then

430
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,560
 somewhere in the discord, there was a link to an air table that told you where

431
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,920
 the program was and then that sent you to zoom and that sent you to YouTube.

432
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:32,120
 And and I don't if there's a way to just streamline this and make it all kind of

433
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,520
 more obvious what the workflow is.

434
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,280
 I mean, possibly doing literally everything through discord would have been better.

435
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,080
 So you can only get the program through discord about this would have then, you

436
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,800
 know, not been friendly to everyone who really doesn't like discord.

437
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,240
 But just I think sometimes we were like, well, if you check your email, you've got

438
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,240
 a link to the air table, which tells you where you go to the zoom and then when

439
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,320
 you're on the zoom, you can then discuss it in the discord.

440
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,040
 If you like, it gets a bit like lots of not to platforms on top of each other.

441
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,560
 Yeah, I think we could have done a better job of having the current set of places

442
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,000
 you might want to go visible at the top of the discord all of the time.

443
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,280
 Yeah, I think so it was difficult because I heard people say like, well, there are

444
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,640
 a lot of places to go to. So we used primarily three platforms, which was

445
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,720
 we using discord for the spine of the convention.

446
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,320
 We were using zoom for interactive program items and sort of parties and the bar.

447
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,280
 And we were using, well, if you're a panelist, we were using StreamYard.

448
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,920
 But if you were a person in the audience, we were using YouTube for the panels.

449
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:46,400
 And I think the thing is that each of those three options represents a solution to a

450
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
 problem that the other two doesn't solve.

451
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,800
 So like discord is persistent in a way that YouTube and zoom aren't.

452
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,480
 So it's very useful to have the discord is like the persistent spine of the convention.

453
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,720
 Zoom allows much better audio visual chat and social space than discord does.

454
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,160
 And YouTube allows much easier streaming.

455
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,800
 You can cast it to your TV very easily in a lot of cases.

456
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,840
 You get the YouTube chat, which integrates with StreamYard.

457
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,480
 So the panelists can I respond to the chat and stuff.

458
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,920
 And so each of them had a thing we needed that the other two didn't have.

459
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,960
 I think the problem when you start trying to combine them is that you end up finding

460
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,160
 that the software that tries to do the things like, so if we came up with a list of all the

461
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,280
 things we needed and tried to find a one piece software that did it, I think the problem is

462
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,520
 those pieces of software are usually not very good or very expensive.

463
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,480
 And the problem we're doing at Fiverr ahead is that is a whole that is a bad choice.

464
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,520
 I think that but I think it's something to bear in mind that people did find it too much.

465
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,840
 I will also say on top of that that one of the people kept suggesting ways we could make it

466
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,440
 easier and every time it's all suggested something so it's just the exact opposite thing to posts later.

467
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,880
 So I saw it would be like you could just turn the YouTube chat on and have all the chat and discord.

468
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,760
 And then someone was like I'm so glad there's the YouTube chat because I really hate having

469
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,400
 the discord open when I watch your panels. And it's like the problem is that you can streamline it,

470
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,800
 but I do wonder whether the problem with going to lots of places would be is a bad

471
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,560
 problem that we do need to think carefully about. But I do wonder whether people would have

472
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:29,920
 found it more frustrating if we had gotten rid of a place that they enjoyed going in favor of a place

473
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:36,000
 they didn't. Yeah I mean I think giving people a lot of choices for how to interact with the

474
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,120
 convention was part of the design philosophy of the convention but we could maybe have done a bit

475
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,840
 more about getting that word out to people. I think we need better signposting for sure.

476
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,560
 No and I think Liz is entirely right which is even if even if for all the reasons,

477
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,320
 even if we think about it really harder we decide that it was inevitable. It is still it was still

478
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:07,680
 obviously a undesirable aspect which if we find a way of fixing we should try to address.

479
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:16,480
 I just wanted to give listeners some context as to why we didn't kind of come out of the gate

480
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,720
 having addressed it already if that makes sense. But I think Liz is completely right that.

481
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,080
 If you were at the convention and you haven't found it already there's a next time thread in

482
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,720
 Discord which was designed to capture your first impressions but you can still post to it at the

483
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,800
 moment. I don't you probably still be able to post to it on Thursday. The Discord is not causing us

484
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:42,480
 any problems at the moment. I think we can also take feedback directly by writing to the con or

485
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,560
 yeah or messaging any of us. Yes and John is going to do a giant form which is going to send out to

486
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,760
 everyone before people have totally forgotten the convention. Yes it will be it will if you haven't

487
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,400
 had it by the time you listen to this episode it has gone into your spam folder so please let me

488
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,280
 know and I will send you another link. That's a strong commitment John strong commitment.

489
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:10,560
 That is thank you that's good. Rachel Livermore as part of her massive burst of post-colon

490
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:17,600
 enthusiasm before she came down said that her next project was going to be designing a front end

491
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:25,200
 to stitch all of these good free services and cheap services together to make a better

492
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,000
 convention experience. So yeah no I hope she's getting on with that but she kind of said it on

493
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,320
 about like in the immediate post-ineffable period where she was probably still very excited about

494
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:46,640
 options. No no one would blame her for having a little bit of a breather after a defable con too.

495
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:54,720
 Rachel gave a talk at a convention about conventions which was the same weekend as punctuation

496
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,040
 and we will put a link to that talk in the show notes if we are able to find it.

497
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,000
 I want to say a little bit more about virtual con because it was a convention about running

498
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,560
 virtual conventions kind of as if smoth con had gone virtual but but not smoth con is going

499
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,400
 virtual but they're talking about running real conventions because that's what they do.

500
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,440
 They are talking a bit about running virtual conventions but this convention I was involved

501
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,040
 in the setup of the convention and was obviously very excited about it and then they decided to

502
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,120
 hold it on the Sunday of punctuation about which I was not excited at all and blew a big virtual

503
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,280
 raspberry but I mean that's not obviously it's not their fault. No but I was sad. I get about it.

504
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,560
 And so Rachel did a talk at it and there were several other talks and they are all available

505
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,840
 online so if you're interested I suspect other people are not as interested in the nuts and bolts

506
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,760
 of running virtual conventions as we are so but we will put that link into the show notes.

507
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,080
 I also think that we kind of made the decision that we were going to run everything through

508
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,280
 Discord and so we were in Discord planning things and people trickled into Discord but I think we didn't

509
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,560
 say, we thought we said this often enough and early enough but we didn't say often enough and

510
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,640
 early enough please come to the Discord and get involved. And the second thing I would say is that

511
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,720
 running a virtual program for a 200 person convention is not that much less work than running a real

512
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,080
 one except the scheduling is easier at the moment because most of our participants did not have a

513
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,680
 lot of pressing engagements outside the house right now. So that was a lot easier but it meant that

514
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,080
 we, you know, people didn't get involved early enough and so maybe we had a smaller pool of people

515
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,000
 who we knew were willing and able to be called on. You have the same problem of if you have a smaller

516
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,280
 group of people then you can't really get into the super niche areas unless you know you have the

517
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,920
 people for those super niche areas and the really niche discussions and if we got people together

518
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,080
 earlier maybe we would have found the five people who are interested in something really

519
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,080
 obscure and interesting to get them all together to talk about it. We could have taken a link,

520
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,720
 despite the fact that we decided we weren't going to have a guest of honor or anything like that,

521
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,560
 we could have taken a link from Mexico's book. We know that science fiction authors are pretty

522
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,600
 happy to come along to virtual conventions if you get in touch with them and ask them and we

523
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,920
 didn't really do a lot of that and we probably could have done some of that to shift our program

524
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,240
 more over to the, we could have invited, we did invite a couple of interesting people but we could

525
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,920
 have invited a few more interesting people if again this is a more time thing. I think a little

526
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,520
 bit longer to plan would probably have been a benefit. Yes. Yeah and I would end by saying that

527
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,680
 I was really happy with the program we had and I saw some really great stuff and I think everyone

528
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:50,160
 who was on it did really interesting things but we could have had a little more time to plan it

529
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,440
 and maybe a bit more time to put together the stuff that needed more time to be put together.

530
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,880
 Yes having said that our program was about the right size, it was about the size I had envisaged

531
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,240
 it being or maybe slightly bigger and it had an almost everything on it was really interesting.

532
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,040
 So there's a good question about well where would you cut things? So I realized I forgot

533
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,400
 something that we needed to mention in the things that didn't go so well. We didn't sort out a

534
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,880
 rotor for manning the persistent bar and the persistent bar didn't persist except at times

535
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,840
 when there was someone in there, even there was a scheduled item in it or there was someone in

536
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,440
 there persisting it. It persisted very nicely whenever there was somebody to take a chart to look after

537
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,560
 it but people would decide to come along see that there was nobody there and go away again

538
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,440
 which kind of makes sense. That happens in the real world as well but for next time I would

539
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,800
 absolutely staff that bar the whole time. I just have somebody whose job title was bought and

540
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:01,360
 I don't know why I didn't. I think another thing is we had, so for those who weren't on the

541
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:07,040
 committee we had three zoom accounts running Punturation, we had the big zoom which was called the space bar.

542
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,160
 We came up with that name about two hours before the opening ceremony so there was a brief period

543
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,200
 where not everything said space bar and our messaging was slightly poor but we enthusiastically

544
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,280
 embraced it and it was good. Then we had zoom 1 and zoom 2 to run the program items in. I will

545
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,120
 say obviously there were some program items that went for quite a long time and started chats but

546
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,840
 then if you went for more than about 90 minutes you kind of needed to wind down so that the next

547
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,960
 program item in that zoom could come in and start setting up and I do wonder whether there'd be

548
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,440
 myelage especially for some of the more conversational items in having just had them in breakout rooms

549
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,520
 in the space bar and I do wonder whether that's something we could do next time.

550
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,400
 We did put things in breakout rooms in the space bar and we probably should have done more of that.

551
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,240
 There is a slight, there's a kind of technical problem which is that you can't

552
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:06,080
 change the names of breakout rooms except by closing the breakout rooms which in practice was fine

553
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,520
 because there were times where nobody was in the bar but in principle would be a horrible thing to do.

554
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:20,080
 So in back in the real world hotel rooms, hotel conference spaces have names so we could have said

555
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:26,960
 your item will be at 2 o'clock in x where x is the name of a breakout room within the zoom.

556
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:34,160
 Yes and we could have named them the "We to Bix Breakout" room and another one I don't know,

557
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,720
 I run out of steam with that. That felt like one of those jokes that...

558
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:46,560
 Yeah it needs work shopping. Listeners, if you can construct a good joke out of what I just said,

559
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,600
 please write it and we'll read it out on the cast. Excellent. Yeah so that does tell us quite

560
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:02,240
 nicely into kind of discussing what we thought went well. I mean I think this now, we need to be

561
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,480
 careful because obviously we ran a convention in the sort of way that we would quite like

562
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,960
 ventures to happen and so we may be biased. I also don't want it to sound like we're just

563
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,440
 massively patting ourselves on the back despite the fact that that is what we will be doing for

564
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,800
 the next 10 to 20 minutes. So strap in listeners but basically I think for me it was the closest

565
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,680
 we've gotten to a convention that felt like a British convention in cyberspace and in general

566
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,280
 I really enjoyed that. I really enjoyed the program partly because I suggested all the program items

567
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,080
 I wanted to see and then watched them which is cunning and I recommend it to anyone. It turns

568
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,200
 out you just write ideas to the program team and if they're good ideas you get to watch them later.

569
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,120
 Life hack. New A. This even works at conventions you're not officially

570
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,360
 involved with. I've been doing at East Cods for years, you just just four or five game panels,

571
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,280
 hope you don't get put on all of them and then you've got some good panels to go to.

572
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,680
 Is grand. I will even extend John's hack for people who don't know. It is possible to fill in a

573
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,440
 program questionnaire for a convention and say actually I don't want to be on the program at all

574
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,240
 but have you considered doing x, y and z which are all panels that have either A

575
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,040
 worked really well in the past or items not panels and I'll talk a bit about that in a minute.

576
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,120
 Items that have worked really well in the past or B. Things I've been dying to see and that I know

577
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,200
 the ex convention is capable of doing but I haven't yet ceded to convention and that does work very

578
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,760
 well in stimulating the thinking of the program team. I mean they may not do it but they may not be

579
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,120
 able to do it for reasons you haven't thought of but they might well take your ideas up.

580
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,800
 Particularly for a larger convention where there are more spaces on the program.

581
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:54,640
 And yeah so I like the program and I also liked the social spaces and hanging out in the bar and

582
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:02,080
 having drinks and also breakfast really liked breakfast. I thought that worked well and

583
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,520
 surprisingly doing park run while voice collected to discord in the pouring rain.

584
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,440
 Several people joined discord voice before I set off and joined again after I got back

585
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,640
 but it was it was really fun to run through the park like with people even if it was virtually.

586
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,240
 Yeah it was it was damn good fun I was a bit I would be a bit worried about it being spectacularly

587
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,880
 crap but only quite funny but it was actually super fulfilling so yeah there's a discord

588
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,200
 server for it now and everything. So those were my highlights I think. Liz what did you think

589
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:43,040
 worked well about the convention? I just had a nice reasonably low stress weekend I thought

590
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,680
 that was good like as far as being convention committee goes I haven't done it that often but it

591
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:55,440
 was for me certainly lower stress than it has been in the past. You stayed up too late.

592
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,520
 I did stay up too late but that's because I knew that was going to happen right there's no way

593
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,200
 that I'm going to help run a convention which is in a different time zone and only go to like

594
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,680
 the six hours of it there are actually during my normal waking hours obviously I was always

595
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,920
 going to stay up late but it is still weird that like everyone else is like so I think it was

596
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,240
 Saturday night when I had assumed I would go to bed long before the cheese tasting started and I

597
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,920
 did not I was still awake and so I had not prepared any cheese and that was a bit sad because everyone

598
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,920
 was eating cheese and I did not have any cheese but it was also I think 1.30 so it was probably not

599
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,400
 a good time to be eating cheese but I did really like it I found a sort of smaller breakout room

600
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,080
 with just a few people and we had a little bit of discussion of cheese and a little bit of

601
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,120
 discussion of wine and just a nice friendly chat and I haven't missed those sort of convention

602
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,760
 chats with people that I only really see at conventions but this time noticeably

603
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:55,040
 some of my chats were I monitored the big zoom over breakfast and breakfast was me and some Australian

604
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,520
 and New Zealand fans that I hadn't chatted to a huge amount in the past and we had a very nice

605
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,560
 sort of little breakfast conversation I enjoyed that I enjoyed the sort of crafty

606
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,640
 meeting greet partly because people were in like their craft rooms where they had all their stuff

607
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,160
 so they could not only show some of their current projects they could show like the things they've

608
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,720
 been doing over lockdown because they'd have like the the past 10 projects or whatever

609
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,280
 to hand because they were in their houses where you had them so you got more of an idea of what

610
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,520
 people had been doing than if it was just sort of a stitch and bitch style one at a convention and

611
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,960
 you bring the thing you're working on and show it you could do a bit more of that. I thought

612
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,520
 the technical side worked about as well as could be expected which is I think we had

613
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,280
 I felt we had remarkably few issues with getting people up and running on stream yard and zoom

614
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,720
 compared to what I feared which is that it was going to be like every you know it was going to be

615
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,840
 every technical nightmare that anyone has had over the past six months of you know screen sharing

616
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:59,600
 failures and lack of sound and lack of video and lots of always this thing on and is it working

617
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,720
 and actually I thought it went pretty well and I think they work quite well I was quite glad we

618
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,600
 found stream yard which I found from a recommendation from the roguelike conference where I was reading

619
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,640
 up about it because they had that nice mud and they said they use stream yard and it just seems

620
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,160
 you're pretty simple to use and you can stream to YouTube and you can stream to Twitch and they

621
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:27,360
 actually recommend streaming to YouTube because the signal degrades nicely so it's a lot easier to

622
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,360
 say okay just show me this at low res if your connection is a bit dodgy and my connection sometimes

623
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,400
 is a bit dodgy so that was quite crucial to me I think some of the people who are suggesting that

624
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:44,560
 we do more technical things including zoom probably I'm fairly sure we had members who watched things

625
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,720
 on YouTube and nothing else and and we probably won't hear as much from them because they're not

626
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,400
 in the discord and they're not all the zooms but there are people for whom YouTube is a technology

627
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,360
 they understand and zoom and discord aren't are a valid a valued part of especially the British

628
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:09,520
 fan community and I would and I like to think that by having some stuff on YouTube I mean I think at

629
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,320
 this point in the cycle of the world everyone can manage YouTube right I mean certainly certainly if

630
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:23,760
 certainly you are not excluding a large part of the bell curve if you if you set up around YouTube

631
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:31,360
 I think that's 100% true and I think it's a good point it's one of the things I'm hoping to find

632
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:37,600
 out with my big evaluation form do you have to be logged into your YouTube account to comment on

633
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,960
 YouTube which I think did put some people off commenting on the YouTube yes so they didn't want

634
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,840
 their like accounts to be publicly used but then they could come in and comment on discord which

635
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,720
 was fine when we had the sort of bifurcated comments going on I mean I will say that it is

636
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,640
 possible to have many Google accounts and it is also possible to have within one Google account

637
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,160
 more than one YouTube account so I have both of these I have two YouTube accounts on my primary

638
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,600
 Google account but no so I will say that I do appreciate there were people who said that they

639
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,360
 did what's going on YouTube but that's why we had the discord open and there were people who said

640
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:18,480
 they did what's coming on discord and that's why we had the YouTube open and I think if we had closed

641
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,000
 either one the group of people who had been preferring to comment on that one would have been annoyed

642
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,480
 at us which is one of the reasons why we didn't close either one I strongly suspect that there are

643
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,440
 different people with different priorities who who had strong preferences there and it like it

644
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,600
 was a little bit of work for the Wrangler in each panel to keep an eye on both chats but there was

645
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:51,040
 a reason we did it like that so what I think well well I had a lovely time I liked the fact that it

646
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,160
 came despite the fact that we gone it's a British convention we're doing a British thing it actually

647
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:04,080
 came closest to being the permanent floating global party off my dreams of stuff that I've done so far

648
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,440
 and I do quite want to run a permanent floating global party of my dreams at some point but that

649
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:17,600
 would require a much more global team to run it I but we did in fact have members from Australia

650
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,160
 who were propping up the bar at breakfast time and we had members from the west coast of the

651
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,120
 United States who were keeping that bar open extremely effectively in the early hours of the

652
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:33,120
 morning and everything in between and that was quite nice it wasn't true that we never closed but

653
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:40,160
 we did have a nice long patch of enjoyment I thought a lot of our individual program items

654
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,320
 which we did do some things that you can't do in a real space we had some talks that were

655
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,960
 that would have been different difficult to deliver because people were talking about

656
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,440
 stuff where they had stuff to had this was something we'd observed from

657
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,920
 concealant had some talks where people were talking about something practical that it's

658
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,400
 useful to have props to hand and I think that we did some of that we had things like the

659
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:12,320
 trip to the fan museum that everyone loved bits that again you just don't get to do those things

660
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:20,880
 in the physical world we had the collaborative jigsaw I want to shout out was successful beyond

661
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,960
 my wildest dreams and I now know of three servers that have acquired collaborative jigsaw since

662
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,040
 punctuation so you know that's clearly something that people like

663
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:39,920
 um I really liked that I could find people to chat to it whenever I pretty well whenever I

664
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,240
 wanted to chat um I liked the fact that people were very appreciative of the ribbons and I really

665
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:53,120
 liked the fact that um that people noticed lots of people noticed that the ribbons changed to

666
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,160
 Sharpie if you joined the convention after five o'clock on friday and somebody even observed it

667
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,640
 was probably more work to do a ribbon with Sharpie on it that we was to do a ribbon on

668
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,040
 with the the original ribbon font we'd been using which was true so that was fun

669
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,600
 um a learning is that I should definitely have done the ribbons a lot greater advance I'm an idiot

670
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:18,480
 um yeah I can't really just do I can't split things everything I think this was good I think

671
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,120
 this was bad at the same time I think there's quite a few things where I was like yeah this was great

672
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,240
 and we should have really thought about it you know a week in advance of when we did think about it

673
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,200
 oh there was loads of stuff that we didn't really think about until two minutes before we did it

674
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,800
 several people there's quite a bit of feedback about it would have been useful to have this earlier

675
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,040
 and I'm like it would have been useful to have thought of it earlier yeah every time I was all

676
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:47,040
 said like I would have been useful to have more like notice of this I was thinking yeah for us too

677
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,000
 like believe me of all the people who are aware of the fact that we could have used a bit more

678
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:01,040
 time to plan we were very aware of that oh but but also because you've because we've not done it before

679
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,800
 when you when you're doing the second or subsequent to something you you have a kind of starting point

680
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,680
 of all the ideas that other people have had and we did get some ideas um Claire Boothby ran an

681
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,400
 amazing treasure hunt for us and I think if you haven't if you haven't done it it's worth going

682
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:23,200
 into discord and seeing all the imaginative and interpretive ways people delivered their treasure

683
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,280
 hunt clues because they were they were fantastic and very entertaining um and also Claire Boothby

684
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,680
 did a great job Claire Boothby did a fantastic job for us I think pulling in Naspics she used the

685
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:42,240
 code base from Naspics treasure hunt was basically the idea and um and I think that actually showed

686
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,040
 gave me a sense of where people were because it because because a lot of the things

687
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,320
 asked people to go outside the house you got a sense of how all of our members fit within their

688
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:57,360
 local environment and I would like to I would like to lean into that another time I'd like to see

689
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:03,600
 more stuff that took people outside of I mean I guess we know what people's studies look like now

690
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:11,680
 but actually taking people outside of that space to show their environment yeah so um I think I

691
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,520
 think we've talked um probably flog it off about what we will what we liked um but I do want to

692
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,760
 note that like from what we've all said it it does sound to me like one of the themes in what we

693
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,680
 like was the interactivity like you've both mentioned the kind of the crafting rooms and the social

694
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,080
 spaces and the interactive program items quite a bit and and I do think that makes me happy because

695
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,480
 one of the things we were setting out to try and do was do something that was a little bit more

696
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,000
 interactive than than some things that have been happening previously and I think I hope that we

697
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,480
 did manage to do that I mean obviously people whom this was your first online convention won't have

698
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,600
 a point of reference but hopefully people who have been to a couple um will have recognized where we

699
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:02,000
 were trying to kind of um encourage that so I hope to be fair we're all people for whom our

700
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,840
 model will have worked because we designed it yes yes that has been the 19th episode of the

701
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:17,840
 Octa Thought podcast it is goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

702
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,960
 I would say that one of the things I did for the first time at punctuation that I've not done before

703
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,440
 this is an indication of how it wasn't as much work as running a real con because often when

704
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,600
 you run a real con you don't really do anything at the convention that's not running the convention

705
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:59,680
 um is I played Among Us for the first time which is a social card game social board game yes John

706
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,920
 yes it's sort of it's kind of werewolves in space and I was so crap at it how crap at it was I John

707
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,320
 you weren't as crap as you thought you were but still quite crap but it was your first time

708
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:15,680
 playing crap I was like I am I am doing a good job of bluffing about how I'm not the imposterer

709
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,240
 they were like Alice is the imposter let's spacer and we have one game that lasted for a total of

710
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,840
 about two and a half minutes which I think is probably not very much fun for other people

711
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:29,920
 and it reminded me that I don't really like that sort of bluffing game very much um because

712
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,120
 as everyone who knows me knows I'm not very good at bluffing I mean yes so I was I was trying to

713
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:41,840
 work out how to come around to maybe saying that out loud without being mean but yes um I think so

714
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:48,080
 for those who haven't heard um so Among Us is a a video game that's been out for a while but has

715
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:56,000
 taken off in popularity during lockdown um it is a kind of combination of a top-down um game about

716
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,920
 spaceships and a social deduction game um the problem with games like Blood on the Clock Tower

717
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:08,160
 and Werewolf and the Resistance and other games like that um when you're playing over video or

718
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,680
 audio is that obviously when you're not in a room with other people you lose out on a lot of the

719
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:19,280
 um ways that you can tell things about what people are saying from their cues that they're

720
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,480
 giving you through body language and through facial expressions and what Among Us does is it replaces

721
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,360
 the need to do that with a computer game where you can see what people are doing in the computer

722
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:36,320
 game and you can infer things about their um motivations from the things they're doing in a virtual world

723
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:42,480
 where you have different cues and I think that is the reason it has become so staggeringly popular

724
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:50,080
 in lockdown because it is a game which introduces a layer which makes it a lot easier to play it

725
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,960
 remotely um I think in real life you'd still probably want to play Werewolf or something similar

726
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,720
 although not everyone loves Werewolf um but yes we were playing that punctuation um a couple of nights

727
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:07,200
 it was basically third row plus like a lot of the people playing gays were third rowers um but like

728
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,920
 Alison came along Sandra Bond played with us for a while um and said I know I have a noob but I

729
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,440
 just scold you at one point which was great um and like yeah no it was it was actually really good fun

730
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,760
 um and it turns out if you have a group of about five people playing games eventually that group

731
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:28,000
 people balloons to about 10 or 15 people playing games um even at a virtual convention um but yeah

732
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:36,320
 no it was really good um I I sort of I had ambitions of playing more complex games but most nights I'd

733
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:41,120
 run out of energy to do anything other than play like little social deduction games which is not a

734
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:48,240
 problem because I love them I'm going to suggest to my friends running a very large party in the

735
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,720
 near future that they take one room of their very large party for a particular game that we all

736
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:01,520
 used to play in the bar when we were young which is charades because I believe that zoom is the

737
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,560
 perfect environment for playing charades because you can make the person who's doing the charade

738
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:14,560
 be on mute and I'm like you go on mute and and all of those things where people are trying not to

739
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:19,680
 say anything but they inevitably do um and then everyone else can be guessing it can be not on mute

740
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,400
 and the person could jump up or down and I think I think that will be I have never tried it but I

741
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,240
 am I am going to offer that this is a thing we might try is um and you can use you can use the

742
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:36,320
 private chatter to give somebody the name of a thing to charade as well so the the bar version of

743
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,600
 this game just has whoever guesses the charade gets to do the next one and the person who has just

744
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:49,280
 been chararding gives the next person something terrible to charade yeah and I am quite excited

745
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,280
 by the prospect for doing this in zoom I think it will be a laugh and also be a social game that

746
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:01,280
 does not require any activity and um yeah and because it's charades people can do yeah it'll be

747
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,200
 funny that's my that's my plan so yeah so carol i'd you heard it here first I don't know if carol

748
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,360
 and listens to the show that is my my one big regret is that I did not stay up late enough to play

749
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:18,720
 games with you guys but it would have been you would have had to stay up very late I would have

750
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,800
 I think I would have had to get up very early he's more accurate so now that people know the format

751
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:30,400
 for a convention we can do things like booking people into the game into run games in the bar

752
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,880
 yeah I mean that is something that is something that we definitely could have done um I will say

753
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,120
 that when we were playing games this I think it was 4 a.m. your time so I don't think it's one of

754
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:48,720
 those really awkward times where it's not pleasant from either direction um yeah it's not my other end
