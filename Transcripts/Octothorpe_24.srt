1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
 But it basically turns into me complaining about Disney Plus not being here, which I think I've done on the podcast.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:15,000
 Least once before so many times this yeah, we could like have a checklist at the beginning of the podcast that says this podcast message availability to Disney plus.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,540
 What's wrong with the Marvel universe.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,900
 Oh, to the Bingo.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,800
 We to mix it's also gone dark if you know while we were doing the podcast.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:30,400
 Look, I've been very I've been very good about not noticing that because I have nearly commented like three times.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,900
 I know John don't do it.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,100
 I literally have not noticed until Liz mentioned it.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,800
 Oh God.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:53,400
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 24th episode of Octa's orp, which will be coming out on the 4th of February.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,500
 2021.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
 I'm John Coxon.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:03,800
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Betty and we are coming to you with some letters of comment.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:12,200
 So first up we have Duncan McGregor who tweeted at us to reassure us that he quite likes discussing convention finances.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,600
 So we're glad that it wasn't just Clare, Mark and Alison.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,100
 I mean, Liz, obviously we loved it.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:27,400
 One thing he says is that he has been finding that there is he has been finding that lockdown means he's quite screened out or zoomed out.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,600
 And so he finds conventions that are very screen heavy, very difficult because it's a lawful lot of screens all at once.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,900
 And something I realized is that we don't discuss the more distributed events as much on this podcast.

20
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,600
 I noted in my reply to him mainly because they don't go as catastrophically wrong and require our comment.

21
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,600
 There is the first Thursday zoom meeting, which happens on the first Thursday of the month and is for the kind of replacement for the physical first Thursday that's held in London.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,200
 Sheffield fandom have a regular zoom, which you can find on the anonymous Claire, discord server and on the Sheffield fandom Facebook group.

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:12,900
 And there's also a series of panels from Essence of Wonder who are doing kind of weekly weekend panels, which are just a single panel, which you can watch with some interesting topics and whatnot.

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,200
 Unfortunately, the end of this one of Wonder panels very often conflict with things I already have my calendar.

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,600
 So I haven't actually gotten to one yet, but they have done some really interesting stuff.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:32,100
 So if anyone out there is in Duncan's boat where they don't want to go to a whole convention worth of screens, but they wouldn't mind kind of dipping their toe in occasionally, then yeah, check the show notes because I put some links.

27
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,600
 There's also different sorts of screens.

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,500
 So I've now seen quite a lot of buzz about running parties or events in Google sheets.

29
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,500
 I have been to one of these and it didn't quite work for me, but I think it's an interesting model.

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 There are also things you can do that are more audio based rather than video based and getting getting your zoom kit out of your study is quite useful as well so that you can kind of sit around in your living room watching watching things, which is something that we're quite familiar with.

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
 I know it's still still screens.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,500
 I finally am listening to slightly fewer podcasts because I used to listen to podcasts on my way to work and I no longer leave the house and go to work all the time.

33
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:29,000
 But I find podcasts to be actually quite a nice way of keeping up with people and just listening to people chat about stuff in a way that was sometimes filled by sitting at the back of a convention panel.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,500
 And often they're not particularly visual anyway, so I'm quite happy to have that all happen sort of just as an audio thing I can listen to whenever I like.

35
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 And the second thing I would like to say is you had a party in Google sheets. Please explain.

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,000
 They exist. There's a there's been a serious article about doing this. So it's not just amongst our friends.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Explain what it is because at the moment it sounds like you're basically making some sort of flip book out of Google sheets where your color coding each cell to be a pixel and you're like going through the sheets very quickly to simulate video.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,500
 And I assume that's not it. But that's the only thing I can think of.

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 No, but you've correctly identified part of it, which is that how often one of the tabs will be a coloring thing where people are creating collaborative art by filling in the colors of cells, then they do puzzles in places, then they hang out in places.

40
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:28,500
 Because I really like spreadsheets, but I'd not considered trying to have a party in one. Going back to what Alison said about having your zoom rig outside of your study.

41
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,500
 I do wonder to what extent people's screen downness is a more to do with kind of worked out.

42
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 And I think one of the things I've learned in lockdown is that being able to segregate your workspace from your personal space is very important.

43
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:52,500
 And one way to do that is moving your zooms at your study. I find that I am getting better at context switching as I spend more time doing it.

44
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 I'm getting better on the weekends, not thinking about work and I'm getting better during the work.

45
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 They are not thinking about leisure products.

46
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 But I think there's something to be said for trying to achieve that kind of separation of work, screen time and home screen time and that might also be something to look at.

47
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,500
 But having said that is also very possible to be screened out in general.

48
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:22,500
 And I'm glad that our podcast provides a kind of solution to that in some small way.

49
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 So glad to hear you're enjoying it still Duncan.

50
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:37,500
 Yeah, I think I'm very aware that while I can have basically a room that is my office for work that I can afford to develop entirely to work and then still have the rest of my flat for non work things.

51
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 It is a lot more difficult from a lot of people who cannot segregate their living space like that.

52
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 And I think in the early days when I was using one room as kind of my office and bedroom, that was part of the problem because I didn't want to go and sit in there and then watch a convention panel because I'd already been sitting there, you know, working for eight hours.

53
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
 Yeah.

54
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
 But I think we are all lucky enough to have a study in the Octa Thorpe team.

55
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
 I have issues with shared space.

56
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 I don't have a room in my own as Virginia Woolf would say.

57
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 But it's my own fault because I have a five bedroomed house.

58
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 So if we had a act together.

59
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 Yes.

60
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 Let's move on to Claire Briarley's lock.

61
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 So Claire says that Alison will be relieved to know that it was London con in 1957 that the winner of the Fansing Hugo had three editors.

62
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 So it's not blocked as fault.

63
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,500
 It's science fiction times is fault edited by James V. Tarrasi senior, Ray Van Halton and Frank, our Prieto junior.

64
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 I have two things to say about this.

65
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 The first is I was just talking about the rockets.

66
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 I was literally talking about the trophies.

67
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 I knew that there have been more things.

68
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 It's the it's the matter of giving away more than one trophy and then three or more trophies.

69
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 I think it's a very good job on Facebook that it wasn't really about the trophies or the amount of space on the PowerPoint at all.

70
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 It's about invitations to the reception and to the Hugo Losers party and to other events surrounding the Hugo's.

71
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
 That this is the thing that seems to be the big constraint here.

72
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
 So it is it is who gets to be in the room where it happens.

73
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 Well, and as I think we discovered as I think I said last time, Worldcon's have had a policy of basically saying you can have as many rockets as you like, but above some level we will charge you the cost of the rocket, which I think is an enormously kind of fair and fine way to handle that particular aspect of the thing.

74
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:48,500
 I think I can see where they're coming from in that the Hugo reception. I've been to a couple of Hugo receptions as either an acceptors plus one or I think as a member of the long con committee.

75
00:07:48,500 --> 00:08:01,500
 I enjoyed going to them, but I wouldn't say it was necessary for me to have gone to them or the person who I was the guest of the acceptor needed me there for support particularly.

76
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:09,500
 So you probably could cut down the guest list a little bit by just taking a firm align on some of that.

77
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:19,500
 For instance, you often have the committee there. You might have the committee there because some of them are possibly accepting for finalists where there isn't a designated acceptor.

78
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 And you could possibly cut that down by having fewer people to do that.

79
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 So you just have like one designated acceptor for everyone who is not there in person. But I think that wouldn't make a serious dent in the numbers.

80
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
 It probably is the fact that you could have an awful lot of nominees who all bring a plus one.

81
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 But I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm not sure the best way is to say where you can only bring two people.

82
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 Claire notes that Terry Carr and Ron Elick won a Hugh over Fanac and they decided that they would swap it back and forth at successive World Cons in elaborate and public ways at room parties and thus get to award and receive it over and over again.

83
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 And Claire notes that her and Mark intended to follow in their footsteps with their first nova. But obviously anyone who has seen Claire and Mark's enormous nova collection will know that did not quite go entirely to plan.

84
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 That's not the reason it didn't go to plan.

85
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,500
 But Jimmy, the passing back and forth became no longer necessary at some point along with the nova.

86
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,500
 Because they had to remove their no shagging disclaimer from their fad scene.

87
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 Well, no, because it also wouldn't make sense to take the truck of 14 novers to every convention.

88
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
 No, no, no. That's not.

89
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 They formed a household. They stopped living in separate households.

90
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
 But there's no reason that I couldn't present a Spaniard with a rocket at a convention.

91
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 That is quitter talk. And if that's why Mark and Claire, if that's genuinely why you didn't do it, shame on you.

92
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 You should be. That's not a good enough excuse.

93
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 So you're saying that they should have a room party at a convention when we can have conventions in real life. In fact, they could do this on Zoom.

94
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
 And they should award each other their entire collection of nova.

95
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 In fact, we can do this on Zoom and I'm throwing down the gauntlet.

96
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 Mark and Claire, you should pass your banana wings, novers, back and forth to each other.

97
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,500
 Because they basically be in their two little pods on Zoom and they could move...

98
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 They could basically... one of them could move from one room to the other with the nova that had awarded to them.

99
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
 Then they could reverse the process and it would be funny.

100
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,500
 There'd only been different rooms. They just need to be sat next to each other on Zoom and then overpasses from one little Zoom window to the next Zoom window.

101
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 Oh, no, that's great. In fact, that's such so good.

102
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 I do want to do a bit where we pass the Hugo to each other on Zoom.

103
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,500
 I need to sort that out with Mike and Steve. Hang on.

104
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 Their separate Zoom webcams are both attached to desktop computers.

105
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
 I should send them a Mac.

106
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
 Yes, I'm sure that will go well.

107
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 The next logical step in the week of its saga is for Addison to just start sending people computers.

108
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,500
 Like, where else do we think this would end up? I think if any of us had thought about it,

109
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 we'd have been like, "Allison will definitely start sending just random computers to people."

110
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,500
 I've been thinking about it, but what's happened is that Zoom stopped working on these very old Macs.

111
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 And I think it is now working again, but you need to do a bit of a "futs with it" and I haven't done that.

112
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,500
 But indeed, I have quite a lot of Macs that would run Zoom and I have quite a lot of people who are kind of like,

113
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
 "I can't go on Zoom because I don't have a computer who can run it."

114
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 And yeah, it's a plan.

115
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 He'd like the Zoom theory.

116
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 Another letter of comment came from Mark Plummer, who also discussed the Hugos.

117
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:40,500
 And he talks quite a lot about the Hugos in general, but he discusses an anecdote at the end of his email,

118
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,500
 where he says, "A better example of what it all means was in Spokane.

119
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 Somebody was handing out, I voted in the Hugos' ribbons and someone who was there who I didn't know,

120
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 but was just a fan who was present, said, "What's a Hugo?"

121
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,500
 And he's like, it felt to me that fandom had been saturated in debate about the Hugos since Easter,

122
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
 especially because this was the year of the puppies,

123
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 and then there was someone who was interested enough to be at the World Contour of Join and to attend

124
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 and then not to know what the Hugos were.

125
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 And so I thought it was a great story because it points out that the Hugos have a disproportionate level of discussion,

126
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 but it would be interesting to know what percentage of the people who attend the World Contour know

127
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,500
 or the Hugos are, because obviously at the level that they're listening to a podcast about science fiction,

128
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
 you're probably more likely to know.

129
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,500
 But I do wonder if you're just someone who wanders off the street, like, you might not.

130
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 I don't have a good feeling for how glued together the two concepts are in the head of the average attendee,

131
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
 because I'm appreciative I'm at one end of that bell curve.

132
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,500
 I could have looked up but have not yet how many people vote in the Hugos each year.

133
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
 Maybe that would be a useful way of doing this.

134
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 Mark also said, and I apologise if you've said this already and I wasn't paying attention.

135
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
 Is that Mark saying that? Are you, Alison?

136
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 Me. Mark also said that the episode was much enhanced for him at least,

137
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 because we rarely talked about gaming this time.

138
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
 Does that mean we need to institute video game corner?

139
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,500
 No, I just thought it was funny. I'm saying it for the podcast because I think it's funny.

140
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:25,500
 Moving on to Chris Garcia's Letter of Comment, he says wonderful episode and perhaps the finest use of the...

141
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,500
 in podcast history.

142
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,500
 And then he says the Hugo thing had a few things that weren't thinged.

143
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,500
 And that is very true. He is astute, and that is, I think, a very good point.

144
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 He is astute and the world needs stutes.

145
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 I just love basically all the phrases in Chris's letters.

146
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:53,500
 I won't read them all out, but I do like him saying this is the corniest of corner cases to go with the few things that weren't thinged.

147
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 Yep, yeah. No, he's a wonderful writer. I do love Chris.

148
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:08,500
 Disc on three. Disc on three have announced that they're going to make an announcement,

149
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 but they haven't yet announced what the announcement is.

150
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,500
 They've been a little bit more specific. They've announced at some point this weekend they'll provide an update on Disc on three.

151
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 On the server they sent out to say basically, would you attend a virtual or hybrid or real world convention in August or in December?

152
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 And also tell us why they've waited so long to update us.

153
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,500
 I was hoping that by weekend they meant they would do it on Saturday, then by the time we record we would have the announcement.

154
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 But clearly they meant we'll do it too late in the weekend for OptiTalk to comment on it.

155
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,500
 Do they not have any thought for the timing of podcasts?

156
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 Well, I think what this clearly shows is that World Concomitites are running scared from our incisive commentary.

157
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 Alison, any thoughts?

158
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 Those were literally my thoughts. I had two thoughts and it was those two thoughts.

159
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
 Oh, excellent.

160
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
 That one was definitely not my thought.

161
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 They've deliberately left it till Sunday because if you say this weekend, they're the parable of the unexpected hanging applies and they have to do it now today.

162
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 And we will expect it.

163
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 And I thought, well, they don't want to do it on Saturday because OptiTalk would trenchantly comment on it and that would be sad.

164
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
 Fully expecting that as of comment from the Disc on three committee now.

165
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
 So bring it on, Disc on three, we're ready.

166
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 Like a World Concomitite have time to listen to podcasts, John.

167
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
 Why else do they do whether typing?

168
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 I know that I might be in a normally because I think Liz only listens to podcasts when she's not working, but I listen to podcasts while I am working.

169
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 So for me, the more productive I am, the more listening I do, which is perhaps not common.

170
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 I cannot multitask in that way. If I try and put a podcast on while I'm working and doing anything other than the kind of boring instead of wrote day to entry or something, then I'm just not listening to podcasts at all.

171
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
 Fair enough.

172
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
 I have different bits of brain.

173
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 And she keeps them in jars listeners. You heard it here first.

174
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
 I do.

175
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 I do.

176
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 I cannot listen to a podcast if I'm doing anything that involves processing text.

177
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 You know, I can't read and listen to a podcast or write and listen to a podcast or anything of that sort, but I can absolutely draw and listen to a podcast.

178
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
 Yeah.

179
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
 So, or make badges and listen to a podcast.

180
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 I can do those things.

181
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 This gone threes hotel is having some issues and the owner of the hotel has filed for bankruptcy because Marriott who operate the hotel have asked them for a lot of money and they have said, we don't have any money.

182
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 We're going to file for bankruptcy.

183
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:59,500
 And apparently this is not a new piece of news because we have a link in our show notes linking to a previous discussion of this in various smuffy circles.

184
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:11,500
 But yes, it is something that is a prominent, especially, I think, Maria are having financial difficulties at the moment as well, which might partly be because we're in a global pandemic.

185
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,500
 People don't tend to go to hotels.

186
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:15,500
 Yeah.

187
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:23,500
 So my, I would say that I haven't stayed in the world con hotel, the Marriott Walkman Park, but I have stayed in the hotel next door.

188
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,500
 And they are two really, really big hotels and they are not in the center of Washington, D.C.

189
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,500
 They are like a sort of short metro ride outside the center.

190
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:42,500
 So they're perfectly nice, but I can see why in a time of reduced travel, they might be having serious problems because it is a very big hotel.

191
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 And it's not right in the center of D.C.

192
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 So it might not be the place that is still getting what little business traffic there is.

193
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,500
 [Music]

194
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,500
 Capricon and the FilcCon, why parasitic conventions are a great model in virtual times.

195
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 Is that what I said? Yeah. So Capricon is next weekend.

196
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:16,500
 Tammy Coxon is the chair and it is a Chicago convention that I think started as a reaction to more traditional literary Chicago conventions.

197
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:28,500
 So it is a convention that has a bit of a party vibe, I believe, and a slightly younger crowd than is maybe normal for our traditional SF conventions.

198
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 And one of the things it's got is a Filc track and it's happening next weekend, which is the traditional weekend of the UK FilcCon, which has been running for 32 years.

199
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:53,500
 This is the 33rd one and it was going to be called Long Player, but when they looked and realized they'd have to take it virtual, they changed its name to Long Distance Player.

200
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,500
 And they're running it as part of the Filc track at Capricon.

201
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 So if you join Capricon, which costs $10, you get a free UK FilcCon.

202
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 And if you were only going to the UK FilcCon, then Capricon say, just join us at the free rate because Capricon, and I think this is a brilliant model that we should steal for punctuation to, has two sign up options on their website.

203
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 You can either sign up at the $10 rate, three sign up options.

204
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 You can sign up at the $10 rate, which is the regular rate.

205
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:31,500
 You can sign up at the free rate if you think it's appropriate for you to do so, or you can sign up at the $25 rate to support the convention.

206
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
 And I think that's a brilliant model.

207
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 And they've said that UK Filc is should sign up at the $0 rate because they'll only be coming into the film, but I'm quite excited to get a little bit of Filking in with the rest of the mix.

208
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:58,500
 And of course the Filking will start earlier in the day than some of the other stuff that's going on at Capricon because they're six hours behind us.

209
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:16,500
 And it all seems like a good thing, and conventions could do this more generally, and thereby become global conventions without having to have to do all the work of making that happen, just by getting people in the other bits of the world to take responsibility for their time zones.

210
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
 So I was very impressed with all of that.

211
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,500
 And it's next weekend, so I will report back in two weeks time.

212
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 I do think that the free or $10 or $25 sign up option is very nice.

213
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:41,500
 I mean we did say for Puncuration Con that we would comp your membership if that was a problem, but then there's like a barrier because people have to email you and say, you know, this is a hardship which they may not wish to do, whereas if we just had a button that said free

214
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 or button that said a 5a or button that said a 10a and if we have any leftover it's going to charity, then I think it probably would have worked out just as well as it did with just charging up on a 5a.

215
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,500
 And then after that, Boscone and there's going to be a fan fund auction.

216
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:06,500
 There is going to be a fan fund auction at Boscone, so if you'll listen to this and you have things the fan fund might like to sell, then please let us know.

217
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:14,500
 And it's going to be the same model that we used at Wilcon where it will be a voice auction on Zoom, work really well.

218
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 And people will have to additionally play postage costs from wherever they are unless the donor has agreed to cover them which we'd expect them not to, so you will get your postage costs back.

219
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 And yeah, so please donate things, please come to Boscone and bid on them, please support the fan funds, that sort of stuff.

220
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:44,500
 What sort of things would the fund funds like to auction and is there anything that you've been auctioning like in pandemic times that you couldn't do in a regular auction?

221
00:21:44,500 --> 00:22:02,500
 I think, well we only have a couple, the auctions are more global, so when you're thinking about things to donate, you can restrict them to particular areas, but if you're prepared to ship them globally then thinking about smaller, lighter things is better.

222
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 And obviously virtual things, people can submit things like tuckerizations or things of that sort.

223
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:28,500
 And then finally, we have been, or Alison and I have been at the podcasting panel at the Critical Mass ZoomCon this morning, and we learned about how different people do their podcasts.

224
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:36,500
 The people on the panel were Roman Osansky, Kristin Leleke, myself and Terry Frost were on the panel, and I think it went well.

225
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:43,500
 Gave some software recommendations, gave some microphone recommendations, talked a little bit about podcasting, how much we love the sounds of our own voices, etc.

226
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
 Hopefully everyone enjoyed it.

227
00:22:45,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 I learned a lot of interesting things. I learned that this never happens, has audio issues, because Lillian likes to draw when she podcasts, drum her fingers on the table when she podcasts, and laugh very loudly, none of which thing surprised me at all, but you can see that it would make the editor.

228
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 When I also see how it would make the edit harder, because they also record it, Lillian records it on her phone, and I can imagine that her phone is on the desk next to her drawing.

229
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:27,500
 If I draw, my microphone is elevated from my desk, so I suspect it wouldn't come up on the mic, or if it did, it would be quite easy to eliminate, but I think if you're drawing or doing something on your desk next to your microphone, which is also on your desk, yeah, that sounds like a hard edit.

230
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:39,500
 I recorded on my phone when I was on holiday, and it was a bit tricky, because I did have to sit there and be careful not to move or accidentally hit the microphone, plus I had to turn the air conditioning off.

231
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 So as a podcast went on, I was getting warmer and warmer, and like, are we done yet? But you know, it's a trade-off, isn't it? Normally I don't record on my phone.

232
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:59,500
 I just stick a headset on and then throw the audio at John and make him deal with it.

233
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:07,500
 But I will say that there is something to be said for recording on your phone, because it does kind of democratise the technology a lot, because obviously like my microphone and stand cost about £200, which was for me a not too insurmountable amount of money.

234
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:18,500
 But like, obviously there are people who do not want to invest that in doing a podcast, and they don't have to. And I think it's worth saying that although I don't envy the edit process, this never happens.

235
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 It's not like you can tell really installing, it's very well edited. So yeah, like I think that democratisation of technology is really good.

236
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 And it's one of the things that makes podcasting so accessible.

237
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 Yeah, I mean, I think it's certainly true that you can record on your phone and it will be fine, it just may have some extraneous noise.

238
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:44,500
 Plenty of professionally produced podcasts that have undertracks under the vocal that make them unlistenable for me.

239
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 Thank you very much to Roman for inviting me on the panel.

240
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 So the other thing I learnt from this is that some of the podcasters like to have a beer at their side while they're podcasting.

241
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:02,500
 I mean, I would like to, but it is 11.30 in the morning here and I've got to clean the kitchen after I do this. So it seems like a bad thing.

242
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 Yeah, no, but if we podcasted at eight in the evening, do you think we'd do it with the beer at our sides? I might have one.

243
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,500
 I think Liz would be annoyed. So there's that.

244
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,500
 If we podcasted at eight in the evening, I would not have a beer at my side because it would be 3am.

245
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 Let's think about the future times when Liz is in the UK for some reason and we're podcasting.

246
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 Listen, I have podcasted with a beer, have you not noticed?

247
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,500
 It's possible that Liz is more sensible when drinking. I might have one beer.

248
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 I can't imagine having a few beers while podcasting.

249
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 I can imagine having a couple.

250
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 I think I can imagine having as much beer as I can imagine during an Eastercon panel, which is usually I don't want to be absolutely latted.

251
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,500
 But if I had one and I get another one at the green room, that seems like an acceptable amount.

252
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,500
 I think by the time you're up to like three or four, you might have slightly misjudged. It might be time to calm down.

253
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,500
 So yes. And also, I think Roman said he drinks wine and that's dangerous because wine is stronger.

254
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 So I've been drinking beer that I get sent by Claire and Mark of Croydon and some of those beers have been as strong as wine, including one they sent me.

255
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:25,500
 That was called very big moose and was 12% which is basically wine strength.

257
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:32,500
 Yeah, they sent us a 12% one for Christmas as well, which I enjoyed but is not what I choose for podcasting.

258
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 I wouldn't have a syrupy Imperial stealth podcasting. I'd have like a 3.8% session pay.

259
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,500
 Octa thought the podcast of science fiction fandom and beer.

260
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,500
 Yeah. I mean, when I say I'm drinking beer on the podcast, usually I am drinking a cold lager with ice in it.

261
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,500
 Whoa. I mean, you didn't tell us you were a heathen list.

262
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,500
 This is a hell of a way to find out live on air.

263
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,500
 If I was in Thailand, I'd be drinking cold lager with ice in it too.

264
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,500
 Exactly. This is the thing I'd always thought was an abomination.

265
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:12,500
 And then I realized when it's very hot, you want a nice cold gin and tonic or you want a sort of cold, quite light lager with optionally some ice in it.

266
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,500
 Or sometimes here they will actually like get the beer out of the fridge and put it straight into a glass they've taken out of the freezer.

267
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
 That's quite good as well.

268
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:26,500
 I can understand that. I think I'm having like those funny, freezable rocks that you put in.

269
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,500
 It's just diluting the lager. I'm not sure.

270
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,500
 Although I haven't said that. It is very, very hot.

271
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,500
 I hope it was a when I went to Mike and Flick's wedding.

272
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:43,500
 The bartender asked me two questions when I ordered my London pride, one of which may be very happy and the other may be very sad.

273
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
 The first one he asked was, "Would you like ice with that?"

274
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,500
 And the manager behind him very quickly tapped him on the shoulder and said, "No, you don't do that. That's not how it works."

275
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,500
 But then he said, "Would you like one bottle or two?"

276
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 And I was like, "Two bottles of beer, better than one bottle of beer. Thank you."

277
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
 And then I wandered around with my two bottles of beer and then I had more beer.

278
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,500
 And then I nearly spilled some beer on Flick's wedding dress, which would have been a faux pas.

279
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 But I didn't. And that's why I'm not dead.

280
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 I am thinking about the film Ice Cold in Alex, which I'm going to spoil for you now.

281
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
 Do we have a spoiler, Clackson?

282
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
 [Squeaking]

283
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 There's the final scene of which involves the hero drinking his ice cold beer.

284
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 And the beer in question is, "Calsburg, it's possibly the finest example of product placement in the history of films."

285
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,500
 But that's a very good example of somebody drinking a cold beer when they've been quite hot.

286
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 Surely it's not as good an example of the product placement in the Italian job, which was for Fiat, bulldringly.

287
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 Were they kind of demonstrating what amazing breaks Fiat had?

288
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
 [Laughing]

289
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,500
 They couldn't get Mini to sponsor the movie, but they could get Fiat.

290
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 So if you watch the Italian job, every car that is not one of the Minis is a Fiat.

291
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,500
 But that's not what you're looking at, so I don't understand what Fiat sponsored the movie.

292
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,500
 Like, it's not like you come out of the Italian job thinking, "I want a panda. That's not how it works. You are Mini."

293
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
 That is strange.

294
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
 It is very odd.

295
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,500
 [Music]

296
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:24,500
 The other thing that fandom has been beginning to discuss over the last fortnight is what we are going to nominate for Hugo's,

297
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:33,500
 or more in the circles I've been moving in, what I need to read to know what I'm going to nominate for Hugo's slash,

298
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,500
 what I'm going to read to get a leg up on the eventual finalist's slate.

299
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,500
 So the reason this is a good time to discuss this is that Hugo nominations opened four days ago,

300
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:53,500
 and you can nominate Pop Pickers if you're a member of Discone 3, or if you're a member of Conzeland.

301
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 And I think if you are, they will have sent you an email because I forgot I was a member of Conzeland,

302
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,500
 and so I was quite surprised to get the Hugo nomination to open email. So there you go.

303
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:13,500
 Yay. So I pitched this question to the third row mailing list and Abigail Nussbaum gave me some pointers,

304
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,500
 and then when Liz asked Neil Chime-Din, so you know, screw you, Neil.

305
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 He doesn't listen to the podcast, so I could say that.

306
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 Unless someone dobs me in on the third row Discord, don't you dare hog and watch in you.

307
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 Right, so the first--

308
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
 You're absolutely going to get dopped in for that.

309
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:36,500
 The first book I read for my Hugo reading was The Vanished Birds by Simon Jimenez, which is a fantastic book I would recommend reading,

310
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 and I'm currently reading The Doors of Eden by Adrian Tricowski, which was one of the shortlist for the Philip K. Dick award,

311
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
 and is also very good.

312
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:53,500
 The other books that I'm kind of seriously considering reading are Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson,

313
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:01,500
 Pyrdyn Aze by Susanna Clark, Harrow the Ninth by Tamzin Muir, Vagabonds by Harold Jingfang, translated by Ken Liu,

314
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:09,500
 Network Effect by Martha Wells, a deadly education by Naomi Novick, The Once and Future Witches by Alex E Harrow,

315
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,500
 and then reluctantly-- because I think it's got a good chance of ending up on the finalist's ballot,

316
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:20,500
 but is my wife reliably informed me that it's very not good-- is The City We Became by N.K. Jemisin.

317
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,500
 So, yeah, those are kind of the books that I am imminently intending to read,

318
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 because I think there is a fair chance they might end up on the final ballot,

319
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,500
 and I'm kind of a book and a half into my reading so far.

320
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
 Anyone else doing any Hugo reading?

321
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:45,500
 So I will say that I have read The Vanished Birds, which I picked up entirely on the strength of Abigail Nussbaum's glowing review of it,

322
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:53,500
 and I thought it was extremely good as well. It feels to me like a tiny bit like it will appeal to the people who liked books by Becky Chambers,

323
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,500
 but it works for me in a way that Becky Chambers books completely do not.

324
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:04,500
 I've also read Pyrdyn Aze by Susanna Clark, which I did like but hasn't stuck with me that much,

325
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,500
 but I think it is a very kind of clever and lovely little book, and I'll not be sad to see that on the shortlist.

326
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,500
 I'm surprised to hear people not liking the NkGemison because I've liked most of her books,

327
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,500
 so I'll probably have to read that myself to decide, but that is already on my list.

328
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
 And Network Effect is Murderbot, right?

329
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 Yeah, Puyo.

330
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 So I read the first Murderbot, novella, and when it was nominated for a Hugo a few years ago,

331
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 and liked it but never picked up the rest, so maybe now is the time to go and pick up the rest of them.

332
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,500
 I will say two things, which is firstly, España also likes NkGemison's work in general,

333
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 but the city we became is a novel that has been expanded from a short story,

334
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,500
 and basically España felt that it very much did not need to be expanded,

335
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:56,500
 and the expansion added nothing of note, and that is, I can see how that might give you structural problems.

336
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,500
 We'll also strongly disagree, or maybe not strongly disagree.

337
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,500
 I think the vanished bird is nowhere near as optimistic as Becky Chambers,

338
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,500
 so if you're a fan of Becky Chambers because of the term Hope Punk,

339
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,500
 then do not read the vanished birds assuming that that is what you're getting,

340
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 because you will very much be disappointed, but I still think it is.

341
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,500
 It does share a lot of things in common that are not perhaps the inherent optimism of Chambers' work.

342
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,500
 Which is say, you are absolutely correct that the vanished birds does not have the sort of hopeful,

343
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,500
 optimistic aspects that the Chambers did, but I think the problem was I didn't like the hopeful,

344
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:35,500
 optimistic aspects of it because it felt like it almost forced it into a plopped corner

345
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,500
 where everything ended and I only read the first one.

346
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,500
 All the episodes ended in a very happy, optimistic way,

347
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:49,500
 and I felt that they often ended too easily or in too quick a resolution.

348
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
 I'm not saying it's a good thing about Becky Chambers writing,

349
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,500
 but I am saying that I suspect an enormous segment of her fanbase

350
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
 think it is a good feature of her writing.

351
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,500
 Yes, and you're right, I probably shouldn't say this is like for people who like Chambers

352
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
 because they probably won't like it.

353
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,500
 No, because I love Becky Chambers and I love the vanished birds

354
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,500
 and I think the parallels you've identified are why I love both.

355
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,500
 I only started making a note of what I was reading in October,

356
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,500
 so I may have read other books, but as far as I can tell,

357
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:24,500
 the only book I have read that is in the running is Piranese

358
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
 and I enjoyed it a great deal.

359
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,500
 I would definitely nominate it in a position of almost complete ignorance,

360
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,500
 but I have read a lot of other Hugo nominated and Hugo winning books

361
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,500
 and I think I would certainly be happy to see it on the ballot.

362
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:46,500
 The other book I thought might have been a 2020 book turned out to be a late 2019 book,

363
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
 so that's a bit sad.

364
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
 I'll probably read some others, but I haven't done yet.

365
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,500
 I wanted to pick up a point John made about the NK Gemmerson

366
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,500
 maybe being a not very good fix-up to say that that has not stopped books

367
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
 from winning the best-lobbled Hugo in the past.

368
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 Oh no.

369
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 Many fine, well, no.

370
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,500
 Lots of Hugo winners started out as short stories

371
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 and did not gain anything by being expanded to novel length.

372
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
 It's a very common thing.

373
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,500
 And I will also say that España really dislikes the book Flowers for Algonond

374
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,500
 because it was expanded from a shorter work and I love that book.

375
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,500
 So it might also be that España is more sensitive to the issues that arise as a result of that transition

376
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
 than other readers.

377
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,500
 Do you want to know it's pronounced Algonond or not?

378
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,500
 No one I have seen who has read the Gemmerson has said that they think it deserves a nomination.

379
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,500
 Had you read the short story of Flowers for Algonond before you read the novel?

380
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
 No.

381
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
 Yeah, that's the point, isn't it?

382
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,500
 Because you read the short story, you go, "This is fantastic"

383
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,500
 and then you read the novel ago, that's the short story but at three times the length.

384
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,500
 It's not the point I was trying to make because España has also not read the short story of the Gemmerson.

385
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,500
 Ah, so the Gemmerson might be bad even apart from being a fix-up.

386
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
 Art is subjective.

387
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,500
 Our listeners may or may not enjoy the Gemmerson.

388
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,500
 All I can do is report the opinions my loved ones have had on it because I have also not read it.

389
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
 I think that's all for books.

390
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,500
 I think that is the kind of level I wanted to discuss books at.

391
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
 Oh, before we move on.

392
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:25,500
 Listeners, if you have read any books from 2020 or have heard about any books that people are discussing

393
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,500
 with a view to nominating, please write in and let us know because I for one would love to read

394
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,500
 and get a kind of head start on the eventual shortlist and maybe have some outraged reactions

395
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
 that things I loved did not end up on the shortlist.

396
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
 So please do let, get in touch.

397
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,500
 I think we should say not just books.

398
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:51,500
 Tell us what you're nominating and why, particularly things that other people might not have thought of

399
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,500
 in any category, not just books, so that we can go and check it out while there's still time to nominate.

400
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
 Yes, that's a good point.

401
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,500
 I think it's just that I feel way more informed about TV and movies than I do about books.

402
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:11,500
 I would say specifically I feel a bit under informed about particularly indie games and I do like playing indie games.

403
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:19,500
 So if you have played any particularly good little video games that came out in 2020 that we might like to play with a view to nominate,

404
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:29,500
 then please let us know, particularly because I would like the slate of nominations for the new category to be really, really good.

405
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
 We should have a discussion about that.

406
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
 Sorry Mark.

407
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,500
 Yeah, I'd just like to mention video games on every podcast we do now.

408
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
 Sorry Mark.

409
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,500
 [laughter]

410
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:49,500
 This is a perfect example of how Mark has engaged with us in a way that has changed our narrative and tone,

411
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,500
 thus confirming that we are an interactive experience.

412
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:06,500
 One of the things that's happened as a result of us not spending as much time hanging out with each other this year is that people aren't having as many of those conversations where they go,

413
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,500
 "Oh, what are you reading? I'm reading this. It's great. Have you read X? It's brilliant."

414
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:17,500
 And I think that we've not got quite as much of a general buzz going on amongst our friends about what is good.

415
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,500
 And so we probably need to do that quite deliberately this year.

416
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:29,500
 One thing about this last year is that we're starting to see fewer blockbusters.

417
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:35,500
 So there are blockbusters, but they're just being kept in mothballs until the theatre's reopened.

418
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:46,500
 And so this might give a chance for more considered and thoughtful drama to be nominated.

419
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,500
 This is happening in movies already because the cinemas are closed.

420
00:38:50,500 --> 00:39:00,500
 It's not happening so much in TV. At the moment we're still seeing TV that's coming out of the woodwork because it was filmed before everything went tits up.

421
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,500
 But over the next year we're going to see this effect in TV as well.

422
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:12,500
 And as I like thoughtful cerebral science fiction, I'm really looking forward to seeing some of it pop up in the nominations

423
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:18,500
 and not always have to compete with some giant explosive superhero thing.

424
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:26,500
 So yeah, I think you're right about blockbuster movies. I actually disagree on TV.

425
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,500
 I think the reason we're not seeing... excuse me.

426
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:37,500
 The reason we're not seeing blockbuster movies is because the economics of releasing a blockbuster don't work.

427
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,500
 You don't have enough people going to cinemas and you don't have enough subscribers or streaming video.

428
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,500
 You can just look at Tenet, which was the only blockbuster that came out and it did not do very well.

429
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,500
 You look at how much money Milan made. Sorry, you look at how much money Milan made on Disney Plus.

430
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,500
 It didn't make much money. So you can't release these big Tenpole movies and make your money back.

431
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,500
 So they're kind of being delayed and delayed and delayed.

432
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,500
 With TV, the business model for TV is very much to attract people to streaming services,

433
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,500
 which is why we had stuff like the Mandalorian and Star Trek Discovery prior to COVID.

434
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,500
 And I don't see a reason why they can't keep filming those,

435
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,500
 especially stuff like the Mandalorian, which is a very small number of actors.

436
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,500
 And I would expect them to be filming those kind of with very safety restrictions.

437
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:27,500
 I know they're filming Mythic Quest and Ted Lasso seasons in exactly the same way,

438
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
 just with a lot more masks and hand washing.

439
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:35,500
 So I think it's the problems of making it that are causing the shift.

440
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,500
 I think it's the problems of getting people to watch it that it is.

441
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,500
 Ha ha ha. And I have picked a tie when Alison must stand.

442
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,500
 So I can keep talking about how Alison is wrong about everything.

443
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
 But Liz.

444
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,500
 I think that I could probably argue with you about movies because Warner Brothers have, for instance,

445
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,500
 that their states are all going to come out and streaming.

446
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,500
 I think some stuff will come out as a lost leader on streaming.

447
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
 But I was also going to say for TV.

448
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,500
 I think I've seen some estimates of how much extra it costs to film with COVID precautions,

449
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,500
 and it's somewhere between 20 and 50% extra.

450
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:21,500
 So I do think that means that shows which would be viable pre-COVID are not viable to be filmed

451
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
 under COVID precautions.

452
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,500
 So one example of that was glow on Netflix where they suggested that the problem might be

453
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:34,500
 that you cannot film a wrestling show under COVID precautions without it costing you a lot,

454
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
 lot extra.

455
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,500
 So I think it's also going to depend on the show.

456
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:46,500
 I think while Alison is unable to comment, I could push back a bit on what sort of cerebral

457
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,500
 things you would like to see in best romantic presentation short form, because I would know

458
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:55,500
 in the past few years we've had the Expanse, which I think is a cracking piece of space opera.

459
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:01,500
 We've had Watchmen, we've had, you know, a dirty computer and splendor and misery.

460
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,500
 I mean, we've had The Good Place, which is basically a comedy about philosophy.

461
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,500
 So I think there is some good cerebral stuff already being nominated.

462
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,500
 I'm not sure you're going to see a great big shift in the next few years because already

463
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
 there.

464
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,500
 You should probably give Alison the right to reply now.

465
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,500
 I'm kind of fine with not getting the right to reply.

466
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,500
 But I do, I'm thinking about it while I was standing up.

467
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,500
 I'm not sure there is a place for more cerebral movies, though there are still some people

468
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:39,500
 making quite thoughtful films on small budgets and they might have a space.

469
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,500
 But most of those people are working in television now, as you say.

470
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,500
 And I worry that the Expanse is very good because it's like, this is like five seasons

471
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
 of it.

472
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,500
 I really want somebody to tell me a fantastic science fiction story in an hour or two.

473
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:58,500
 I don't really want to spend 60 hours getting that story.

474
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
 You watch the Expanse.

475
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
 It's very good.

476
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,500
 Yeah, you may not really be the target audience for television.

477
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,500
 [laughter]

478
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:12,500
 I could go on to say that one film that I have heard people saying very good things about,

479
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,500
 is Amazons the Vast of Night.

480
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
 Let me just check the title of that.

481
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:23,500
 The Vast of Night, which is apparently the Vast of Night 2019.

482
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,500
 Yes, but I think that was 2019 in film festivals.

483
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:35,500
 And so it counts under the wide release in 2020 and it is 90 minutes long and has six cast

484
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:41,500
 members and is apparently kind of a self-contained kind of slightly old school science fiction

485
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,500
 story.

486
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
 I had not heard of that.

487
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
 I'll have to watch it.

488
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:51,500
 I think, and perhaps I am off base, but the film I am most, or sorry, not necessarily the

489
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:58,500
 film because obviously Best Dramatic Presentated Long Form takes a variety of forms, long forms.

490
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,500
 The thing I am most excited to nominate in Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form is Palm Springs,

491
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,500
 the film which I believe is shortly coming to UK streaming but has not been here the two

492
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,500
 starring Andy Samberg and Krista Milleotti.

493
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
 If you haven't seen it, I thoroughly recommend it.

494
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,500
 It is fantastic and it is squarely a genre movie so I really hope it gets nominated.

495
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,500
 I think it sounds great but there is no way for me to legally watch that film.

496
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
 So I have not watched it.

497
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:35,500
 Soul, just slipping in there on Disney+ on Christmas Day, cannot fault its genre credentials.

498
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,500
 Yet another film that there is no way for me to legally watch.

499
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,500
 Do not have Disney+.

500
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,500
 Disney+ has not launched in my country and has no estimated launch date yet.

501
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,900
 Another thing that I saw in a cinema was Wonder Woman 84, which I don't know whether

502
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,900
 we will get nominated.

503
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,100
 I really liked Wonder Woman 84 despite the fact that it has some plot points which don't

504
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,500
 make a whole bunch sense but I get the impression the internet at large didn't.

505
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:05,500
 It is not the first time I have liked to think and other people haven't but, yep, I don't

506
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
 know whether that will get nominated.

507
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,500
 But it is a film that was famous that came out in 2020 so it may well.

508
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,500
 I think that is a film that I could watch actually but I have to go to the cinema.

509
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,500
 I assume Hulu is not available in Thailand.

510
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
 No.

511
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,500
 Fair enough.

512
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
 Hulu is available in the US only as far as I know.

513
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,500
 So I expect I can be some of the stuff on Hulu is going to come to start this new Disney

514
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,500
 expansion streaming service or something.

515
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:35,500
 And I mean I do expect Disney+ to launch but they basically, Thailand was not in the first

516
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,220
 wave or the second wave of launches.

517
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:42,060
 I think we will probably get it sometime in 2021 but it is not here yet.

518
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:47,500
 This is not going to be a problem for the vast majority of the Hugo voting electorate.

519
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
 No, not.

520
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,500
 Although I would guess a surprising number of them will be in Australia and New Zealand

521
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,500
 this year.

522
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,500
 Yes, yes, possibly.

523
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,500
 Good point.

524
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:01,500
 I guess it comes spring on Amazon Prime but not yet.

525
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
 Ooh.

526
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
 I can watch it as Amazon Prime.

527
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,500
 I knew it was coming to something.

528
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,500
 So I think most of our people will not be able to watch it legally.

529
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,500
 If it's coming to Amazon Prime then most people will because it will probably be like a worldwide

530
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,500
 release on Amazon Prime outside of the US.

531
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:23,500
 I just hope I hope I would strongly encourage people to track a copy down and watch it prior

532
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,500
 to nominations.

533
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,500
 Hopefully that's on Amazon Prime but yes, I would thoroughly recommend it.

534
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,500
 It is a fantastic movie.

535
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:37,340
 I discovered from one of my tech bloggers a website called Letterboxed which everyone else

536
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:43,500
 might have known about for ages but is a place where you list and share your films.

537
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,500
 Please add me.

538
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,500
 I want friends.

539
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,500
 It's a social network for movies.

540
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,500
 I have been on it for ages but I've only just started reviewing movies.

541
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,500
 Please friend me.

542
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
 I have no friends there.

543
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
 I'm feeling very lonely.

544
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:59,500
 One of my 2021 themes is to watch more movies.

545
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:07,500
 So I have been watching a movie every week so far this year and I have been enjoying working

546
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,500
 out what I think about them and writing a little bit of a review.

547
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,500
 So it's been nice.

548
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,500
 I like that it has, I mean obviously I could do this perfectly well in notes.

549
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:22,500
 It's got several different lists so I can keep lists of movies that are available on Amazon

550
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,300
 Prime and that are available on Netflix and that are available on Disney+ and that are

551
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,620
 available in full on YouTube even though they probably shouldn't be.

552
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,140
 That was the 24th episode of the Octa.

553
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:59,340
 The podcast and it's goodbye from me.

554
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:06,340
 I have no games to nominate.

555
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:12,380
 The two who came up I think were Star Wars quadrants and Animal Crossing in previous episodes but

556
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:17,340
 I'll be interested to see if people submit less massive games.

557
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,340
 Yeah, I mean I don't have a switch and I'm rubbish at shooty X and games.

558
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,340
 You should get a switch which is great.

559
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,340
 Not made of money John.

560
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,340
 What a playstation this year.

561
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:32,340
 But you live in a country that's not very cheap and you have enough money to buy a switch.

562
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,340
 So maybe get a switch Liz.

563
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,340
 Yeah let me look at the price of switches in Thailand.

564
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,340
 I actually don't know the price of switches in the UK.

565
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,340
 Ah no that's fair that's fair.

566
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,340
 Please all send 48 switches to Liz.

567
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,340
 Please join our new Patreon so that Liz can buy a switch.

568
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:55,340
 I'm just going to give the Nintendo switch has a mere 50% markup in Thailand.

569
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,340
 So how much is it in pounds?

570
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,340
 About 350.

571
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:05,340
 Ah I mean that's still... I can't remember how much I paid for mine.

572
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:10,340
 That is the Animal Crossing one because I can't find a non-Animal Crossing one which may be cheap.

573
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,340
 For enough.

574
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,340
 I don't think that's more than your pay for the Animal Crossing one in the UK.

575
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,340
 It's 240 quid on August I had to look it up and check.

576
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,340
 Oh okay fine.

577
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,340
 All right.

578
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,340
 Ahh.

579
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:26,340
 This is not a podcast allow me to share with you my method of tracking movies.

580
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,340
 This is a spreadsheet.

581
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,340
 It is categorized by watch to know what John is having a movie party in Google sheets.

582
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,340
 Jesus.

583
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:42,340
 The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin MacLeod at Encompetech.com
