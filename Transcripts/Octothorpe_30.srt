1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
 I was doing that thing where it uses all my CPU and then crashes.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,800
 So if that happens, I'll see you in a minute.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
 Uh oh.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,880
 Okay, well we'll see you in a minute.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,960
 He just managed to say that before it used all his CPU and then crashed, didn't he?

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,800
 Yeah, he's frozen.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:28,120
 This does not normally happen, viewers.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,360
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 30th episode of OctaThaw, being an installment

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,880
 of OctaThaw Live.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,520
 Pause for ooze.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,880
 Pause for ooze.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
 Ooooh.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
 There it is.

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,600
 Oh, you met from us.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
 Well no one else can talk.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,520
 Uh, this episode will be going out on the 29th of April.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,080
 I'm John Coxon.

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
 I'm Alison Scott.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,440
 And I'm Liz Batty.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,640
 So we have a myriad of letters of comment today.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,440
 We have tweets of comment, discords of comment, Facebook messages of comment, emails of comment,

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,440
 many other forms of comment are available.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,440
 Please check your local comment vendor for details.

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,880
 Chris Garcia writes in to apologise for not locking us last issue.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,120
 Yeah, Chris Garcia notes that he's sorry for not locking the last episode, but he was busy

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,520
 being fired.

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,320
 Um, which is very sad.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,760
 Sorry Chris.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,200
 We hope you find employment soon.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
 Chris also says, congratulations to Hugo nominated, fanzine editor, John the Rock of

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,000
 England Coxon.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,440
 Much deserved and I hope you win.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,200
 So I, I suspect that Chris is hoping that I will win is linked to the fact that if I

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
 win Chris will also win.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,360
 So I think it might not be an entirely altruistic expression of hoping of winness.

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,800
 Okay, I know I was told that there was a subject I was not allowed to snuck about on

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,600
 this podcast, but you were really trying my patience at this point, John.

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,480
 And then he says, congratulations, Alison on the doc we are, which is much deserved

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,520
 and that certificate you shared on the social media was phenomenal.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
 You're awesome.

41
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,680
 That's very nice.

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,520
 Thank you.

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,600
 And then he says other things.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
 Hurrah.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,960
 And then he signs it yours.

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
 John Coxon.

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,000
 Wait, no, I meant Chris Garcia.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,640
 He's working very hard at it.

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,160
 I want to read out Mark Plummer of Croydon's Lock in Full because I thought it was very

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,040
 funny and I will try to read it out without laughing while I do it.

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
 Claire and I were playing Arkham Horror earlier.

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,920
 Things started getting interesting around the fifth turn.

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,160
 I rolled a six and advanced my Charles Dexteward figure, the appropriate number of spaces.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,600
 Excellent, I thought.

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,400
 As I rummaged in the papers in front of me, handed over $100 and positioned by little

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,080
 green plastic house on the square.

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,680
 Next time around I'd be able to build a hotel on Dunwich.

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,160
 Fiendish indeed.

59
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,640
 Claire picked up the die and rolled a two.

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,160
 Hmm, not so good.

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,800
 She moved her Nathaniel Wingate Peasley forward and decided to try a theory.

62
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,320
 Was it Naira Lothotep in the Miskatonic University with the blast from a cycle?

63
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
 That's pretty horrifying, I said.

64
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,320
 And this is Arkham Horror and the objective is to be horrifying except no, that's not

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,400
 the answer, my turn.

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,320
 I picked a card and read it out.

67
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
 Damn.

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,040
 Go to the mountains of madness.

69
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,920
 Go directly to the mountains of madness.

70
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,440
 Do not pass in's mouth.

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,520
 Do not collect the sport of the forgotten.

72
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,240
 Claire sensed that the tables had turned and went on the offensive.

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,920
 E3, she said triumphantly.

74
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,320
 I threw down my card's infrastration.

75
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,000
 Blast, you've sunk my shop digger-ath.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,240
 Thank you Mark.

77
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,760
 We thought that was very good.

78
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,280
 It made me kickle quite a lot when I read it.

79
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,720
 What's really interesting is that I know that you have not in fact played the Arkham

80
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,000
 Horror card game but that is pretty much what it was like so, you know.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,240
 Hmm, right, okay.

82
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
 Yeah.

83
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,760
 I, hmm, it makes me wonder whether you were paying as much attention as I was when we played

84
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,240
 it together but maybe that's unfair.

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,280
 Don, I'm never paying as much attention because I know you were paying attention.

86
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,080
 That is why I like, I asked you ten times yesterday whether I'd used to pull my actions

87
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,760
 and you had to be like, I'm not actually tracking every single thing you were doing in this

88
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
 game, Liz.

89
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,160
 Alright, so...

90
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
 More letters.

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,320
 Mark did also raise another lock in which he doesn't talk about Arkham Horror almost

92
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
 at all.

93
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,360
 He mentions it a little bit.

94
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,240
 This is a lovely glimpse of, you know, life into a certain, Croydon-Fanish household.

95
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,760
 Um, but I think, I think he, I think he raises a good point which is that when he goes to

96
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,240
 it in person he's gone, he's essentially going on holiday with his mates, most of whom he

97
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
 doesn't see otherwise.

98
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
 I think, and he says, as such, he thinks the quality of the convention is only a contributing

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,320
 factor to the experience.

100
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,680
 I think that is, um, basically true in that, and it's something I've been talking about

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,840
 a little bit since confusion wrapped up which is, I had fun at confusion and I think it is

102
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,160
 worth bearing in mind that it would have been very impressive had I not given how many

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,360
 of my friends were all in the same place that weekend.

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,480
 I think it would be very difficult, uh, not to enjoy yourself in some ways.

105
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,600
 Um, so I do, I do think that is something worth bearing in mind that we are always kind

106
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,280
 of grading on a curve, I guess.

107
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,800
 Yeah, but also I think, I even a really terrible Easter con is fun because you're essentially

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,360
 on holiday with your mates and confusion could not fall back on the fun of being on holiday

109
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,400
 with your mates because we were not on holiday with our mates.

110
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,600
 Yeah, he talks about the experience of being in gather and finding himself talking to a

111
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,040
 couple of unexpectedly interesting people and then, and then other unexpectedly interesting

112
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,800
 people turned up, which I think is right.

113
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,840
 But also having the experience of, um, trying to talk to someone in gather and they ran past

114
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,840
 a hundred miles an hour, which does happen at conventions too.

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
 So, you know.

116
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,560
 Well, that's a story where I remember it because it was me who ran past.

117
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,440
 So I noticed Mark was in the cantina.

118
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,960
 So I went up to him and I said, "Hi Mark."

119
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,320
 And by the time he had managed to unmute and video himself, I had already gone back to

120
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
 newsletter.

121
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,120
 Uh, but you know, I was, I was, I was, I was in a rush to get back to these letter, uh,

122
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,560
 because I owed things to the newsletter, like my soul, my blood, my sweat and my tears.

123
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,480
 On the subject of confusion, DC also writes in and they say that they think it is important

124
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,760
 to note explicitly with regard to confusion that there were not just potential accessibility

125
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,200
 issues with the platforms used, but there were issues, um, which impacted negatively

126
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,120
 all members and which led to people in the community not joining, uh, confusion.

127
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,600
 And they kind of know that some of these are things that affect people with visual hearing

128
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,920
 or neuromotor problems.

129
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,320
 And I think, I think, um, and they say that they know we weren't trying to minimize those

130
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,200
 things in any way, but it would be a wrong to overlook the extent to which various groups

131
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,440
 of people felt actively excluded.

132
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
 Um, yes.

133
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,920
 We are, we didn't intend to minimize that.

134
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,440
 And we are very sorry, uh, if it came across that way.

135
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,200
 Um, we did, I think spent quite a lot of time in the run up to confusion, discussing how

136
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,320
 their pre-con decisions were, um, uh, making those groups of people feel disenfranchised.

137
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,360
 And I think, um, uh, that's one of the reasons we didn't touch on it as much last, uh, episode.

138
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,400
 Uh, but yes, it's a very good point.

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,760
 And, uh, we thank DC for bringing it up.

140
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
 Yeah.

141
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,040
 I think it's a, also a good point that, uh, you know, sometimes if I, uh, complain about

142
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,120
 conventions, communication decisions, it's merely things that are like slightly inconveniencing

143
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,640
 me or annoying me a little bit, but for other people, they can actually be deal breakers

144
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,280
 about whether they can attend the convention or not.

145
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,360
 So it's good to be reminded of that.

146
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,520
 Pat McMurray wrote in, now this is very good because Pat is kind of taking us on a tour

147
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,640
 of our back catalog in the medium of locks, which we are enjoying hugely.

148
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,840
 So Pat wrote us a lock, which, uh, he titled Octa Thorpe 2, and it is a lock which deals

149
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:11,640
 with Octa Thorpe's issue 21, 26, 1, 2, 27 and 29.

150
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,400
 Uh, and so this is, um, we, we, we thoroughly enjoyed, uh, this kind of, um, thoroughly enjoyed

151
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
 this kind of thing.

152
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,320
 Uh, and thank you very much for writing your pat.

153
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,640
 We, I'm, and I have seen a few other people, um, on Facebook been talking about something

154
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,040
 about earlier episodes.

155
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,720
 Um, and having gone back to listen to them, um, we apologise, uh, so Alison's first recording

156
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,280
 studio was a well, uh, and mine was a sort of muffly scratchy haystack that I was embedded

157
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,880
 in and Liz was obviously on the beach the whole time.

158
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,440
 Uh, so we have, uh, substantially reworked our recording environment since then.

159
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,920
 We apologise for the, for the less good audio quality of those first episodes.

160
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,760
 Um, but we glad the people are going back to them and enjoying them.

161
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,960
 Um, and thank you for the lock.

162
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,360
 That is nice to, to read.

163
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,680
 I enjoyed Pat's lock because it's a bit like turning Octa Thorpe into some kind of like

164
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
 time loop podcast.

165
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,680
 It occurs in a non-linear fashion, which I think is fun.

166
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,840
 Maybe you should do a non-linear podcast one day, but that will annoy everyone.

167
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,440
 I'm pretty sure that mentioning the fact that it's a time loop is a spoiler.

168
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,080
 I'd also say to those of you who are watching on Octa Thorpe Live, you can see how John

169
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,560
 and Alison have, you know, gone for upgraded and more impressive kit, whereas I'm still

170
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,480
 using the same 15 quid headset that I got for free, that I was using on Octa Thorpe

171
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,000
 one one day I will buy a better microphone, but much like an iPhone, I have not yet been

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 pressured into it.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,040
 Yeah, my microphone comes courtesy of Chris O'Shea.

174
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
 Thank you very much, Chris.

175
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,200
 Um, I, I, at some point I too will buy a better microphone, but it doesn't happen yet.

176
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,680
 My microphone came from a place called Argos.

177
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,360
 Tara Mendelson wrote to us on Facebook Messenger to say that Robin Hobb is a huge Jigsaw fan

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,960
 and at LungCon 3 they made three of her book covers into Jigsaw's for the social space

179
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,840
 in exhibits and then gave them to her after the convention.

180
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,240
 So this is, I think, a letter of comment based on an early episode of Octa Thorpe, as I was

181
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
 just referencing.

182
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,840
 Yes, unlike, unlike Pat, Pharah is listening to Octa Thorpe in numerical order.

183
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,640
 I don't think it makes any more sense that way.

184
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,800
 It may even make less sense to listen to it in the order we did it.

185
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,000
 It might be that Pat is discovering hidden themes that are not visible to the normal

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 listener.

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,600
 Bridget says, "Opportunity for a whole new trench of rhyming poems."

188
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,420
 So Mike, my thought was really what there were three giant Robin Hobb book cover jigs

189
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,960
 alls in the social space in exhibits.

190
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,920
 I never saw those and then I remembered that so I didn't see anything at LungCon apart

191
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,960
 from the inside of ProgramOps.

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
 Yay!

193
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,720
 I saw some other stuff but I did not find the jigs source.

194
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
 That's fair.

195
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,320
 I explored the exhibits hall vigorously and thought it was fantastic and well done to

196
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,560
 everyone involved in putting it together.

197
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,760
 But that's because you were 17 at LungCon and that's how it works.

198
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,640
 That's an outrageous lie.

199
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,000
 An outrageous lie.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
 I was 25.

201
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,600
 Yes, 25 because I was still a young person for the purposes of paying for membership.

202
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
 Just.

203
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
 Oh god.

204
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
 Oh god.

205
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
 And we've also had a couple of tweets of comment.

206
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,720
 There's one from Androsan who says there is one thing she's fairly confident she could

207
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,640
 do with its cross-platform accessible instructional video and she says send anything you need doing

208
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
 her way.

209
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:40,360
 So anyone who wants accessible videos, her Twitter username is A-N-G_G-R-R-R.

210
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
 I think she meant us.

211
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,360
 Oh did she.

212
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,400
 I don't think she read everyone in the world.

213
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
 Oh no.

214
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,880
 Not everyone in the world is listening to this podcast.

215
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,280
 It'll be fine.

216
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,960
 Yeah, but you have to count all the people in the future who go back and listen to it

217
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,880
 either in numerical order or in random date order.

218
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,000
 And Peter Sullivan tweeted to say a killer feature of Gather that we didn't mention was

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,320
 the ability to find anyone else in Gather using the magic red line on the floor.

220
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,200
 I would gladly consider giving tech ops whatever tech budget they need to be able to replicate

221
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
 this in real life.

222
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,040
 I am also very fond of the Stalkure mates option in Gather.

223
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:31,040
 And actually in fact if you'd like to talk to Alison about giving everyone at the Convention

224
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,960
 and Oculus Quest 2 and setting this up, I'm sure Alison would be very interested in working

225
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
 with you on it.

226
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,480
 The third way to use a name is B-O-H-E-M.

227
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,720
 But also, I mean when you said that I was like, oh I wonder if you took the EasterCon

228
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,680
 tech budget, how many Oculus Quest sort of that have bought?

229
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,760
 Is this a bit like if you look at the Test and Trace budget in the UK, you could have just

230
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,360
 sent everyone in the country an iPhone and had them switch tracking on?

231
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
 That's actually true.

232
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,960
 That's how much they spent.

233
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,200
 Very very large amount of money.

234
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,160
 That's not, that's because the actual job of Test anyway, sorry that's definitely off

235
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,560
 topic and we are definitely not talking about it.

236
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,720
 Don your iPhone cannot yet do a PCR test.

237
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
 Lies, maybe.

238
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,480
 I'm sure Apple will, you know.

239
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,120
 If I shove it far enough down my throat, Liz will see.

240
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,320
 Okay, where anyone would like to suggest where we might shove John's iPhone far enough,

241
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,600
 I should mention it in chat.

242
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,280
 Things now said that when we were discussing the problems of an ops room trying to hard

243
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,080
 to replicate a physical convention, it struck him that there's an extremely useful point

244
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
 of reflection here.

245
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,960
 Not only did they fail in trying to replicate a physical convention in the use of a walkie

246
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,280
 talkie apps in an ops room, but in fact they seriously dropped the ball in normalizing the

247
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,280
 use of additional channels and providing support.

248
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:58,160
 And he basically says he thinks that future conventions should promote use of tools like

249
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,480
 Discord so you can easily report problems from around the convention to ops without needing

250
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,560
 to travel to the ops room.

251
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,760
 And I think this is something that future conventions are thinking about and is a good

252
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,800
 idea and I'm looking forward to seeing that kind of thing being taken up by future East

253
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
 Cons.

254
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,480
 And it's actually very good to do it in Discord because I've seen this kind of thing happen

255
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,760
 on Twitter, but then if 10 people all send you a message on Twitter saying this thing

256
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,880
 is going wrong, then you have to reply to all 10 of them say, "Yep, we're aware we're

257
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
 going to fix it."

258
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,400
 In Discord you can do that once and then everyone's like, "Yep, all right, they're

259
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,960
 on top of it, sit back, relax, except they're not because I found this will probably send

260
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
 other 10 messages."

261
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,840
 But in theory that would work.

262
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
 The chat's going wild.

263
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,240
 If they want to set up a poll, but I wasn't paying enough attention to know what the poll

264
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,560
 they want us to set up is.

265
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
 So, you know.

266
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,280
 We're definitely not setting up a poll guys, we're recording a podcast.

267
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,920
 Wait for chat afterwards.

268
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,520
 Can we set up a non-legally binding consultative referend?

269
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,200
 We are going to do that more later.

270
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
 We are.

271
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:05,440
 For shadowing, and then lastly and bestly and PhD-resistant-slee, it is Claire Breyerley

272
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,760
 from Croydon, who says, "Thank you very much for the compliments, but why don't you write

273
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
 to us?

274
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,640
 You really are living the closest a podcast can get to the fanzine life, aren't you?"

275
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,600
 That is a fair comment.

276
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,840
 Lots of you wrote to us this time and you will know because next, if we carry on getting

277
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,120
 this many letters, we are going to have to institute a, we also heard from section on

278
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
 our podcast.

279
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,920
 They wanted to do a poll of where you stick the iPhone.

280
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
 Yes.

281
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
 For God.

282
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
 Okay.

283
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
 That, yes.

284
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
 Family show guys.

285
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
 Family show.

286
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
 Thank you.

287
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,600
 Thank you for other details and comments.

288
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,200
 Thank you, thank you to Andrew January for the bugle reference.

289
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,480
 And also said that she thinks I'm Will Bailey in the West Wing.

290
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,720
 I haven't seen the West Wing, so like most of these references are for the enjoyment

291
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,280
 of other people, but I'm happy to let myself be used as a tool for other people's enjoyment.

292
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,200
 I'd go to, is it a good reference?

293
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,280
 Bear that in mind for future reference.

294
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,640
 Claire also notes that she enjoyed that Liz's Badger poem, and most significantly though,

295
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,040
 you've previously talked around various ways in which people multitask while listening

296
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,080
 to the podcast, but she thinks Badger has won that topic.

297
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,460
 If anyone wants to claim they were also licking their own bum while listening, well, it's

298
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,400
 really up to you whether you want proof.

299
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,640
 We do not want proof.

300
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,400
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

301
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
 we don't even want to be informed really.

302
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,120
 Oh, no, we want to be informed.

303
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
 We just don't want you to prove.

304
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,520
 No, no, just, just informed John Coxon is, is, is.

305
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,640
 And my Twitter handle is J O H L. Right.

306
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,240
 Yes, but thank you all.

307
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,640
 As we say, thank you all very much for the lovely letters of comment.

308
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,720
 They were very nice.

309
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,940
 We have a new feature this week, which is called Ask OctaThorp, our segment.

310
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,900
 And for this first time, if there are questions you'd like the OctaThorp trio to answer, you

311
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,060
 could do it in, in chat.

312
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,660
 You can ask them in chat.

313
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,140
 And at some point we will collate them and then answer a couple of funny ones later in

314
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,980
 the show using a patented back chat method to decide which one we're going to do.

315
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:19,700
 Oh, you want me to make the announcement?

316
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,100
 Well, I want you to do the, I want you to do the joke.

317
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,580
 You said you do.

318
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:30,900
 We have decided that we are going to run punctuation to dot dot dot.

319
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,300
 That was a joke.

320
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
 That was a joke.

321
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:40,420
 That was a joke punctuation to be on the 80th to 20th of June and in traditional style, you

322
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,820
 can't quite join it yet.

323
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,660
 You'll be able to join it quite soon?

324
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
 Yeah.

325
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:52,940
 In late spring, as some of the surfants would say.

326
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,660
 So yes, it's going to cost a fiver again, but this time it's going to cost a fiver if

327
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,260
 you'd like to pay a fiver, or a tenor if you like what we're doing and would like us

328
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,180
 to support us a bit more, or nothing if you like what we're doing, but you don't want

329
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,060
 to pay a fiver.

330
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,820
 Or if you think you don't know, aren't sure if you like it or not, and want to just pop

331
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
 in for an hour.

332
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
 Yeah.

333
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:19,620
 So yeah, we will let you know how to do it soon, and we will also let you know how you

334
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
 can help.

335
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,380
 In fact, when you join, you're going to get a note saying, here's the link to tell us

336
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,060
 how you'd like to help.

337
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:32,780
 So we currently have on our website a big blue button, which says sign up for an email

338
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,380
 when we open registrations.

339
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,620
 And if you type in your email and click that button, we will send you an email when we

340
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,260
 open registration.

341
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:45,260
 If you were a member of punctuation one, we will also send you an email when we open

342
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
 registrations.

343
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,660
 And if you are in the discord for punctuation one, we will put in the discord when we open

344
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,220
 registrations.

345
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,860
 But that will be the only thing we post to the punctuation one mailing list, and it will

346
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,980
 be the only thing we post in the punctuation one discord.

347
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,700
 So don't worry about getting inundated with messages you're not interested in.

348
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,220
 We just want to let people know that the second one is open if they'd like to join.

349
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,540
 And yes, it's going to be good.

350
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:18,940
 We're going to bring back some old favourites like breakfast and the beer tasting and the

351
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,420
 not a park run.

352
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,140
 You too can listen to me run five kilometres.

353
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,380
 Hopefully the weather will be nicer this time because it's June and not November.

354
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,660
 If you've ever wanted half an hour of John doing heavy breathing, this is your chance.

355
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,300
 Liz has not ever wanted that.

356
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,380
 So Liz will not be taking me up on it.

357
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,300
 I regret to inform you that the parks here are currently closed.

358
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,380
 And so if they open reopen by June, I will go out and show you some live video of Komodo

359
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,020
 ever monitor Liz.

360
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,420
 If requested.

361
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,660
 One of the reasons for choosing the dates 18th to 20th of June was that on the 21st of

362
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,660
 June, all restrictions on behaviour in England will cease forever.

363
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,060
 No, no, no.

364
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,340
 All restrictions on behaviour in England will cease forever.

365
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,780
 Some very specific restrictions will cease forever.

366
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,780
 I really hope.

367
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:16,020
 All restrictions on Covid safe behaviour in England will cease forever.

368
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,300
 And so it would be quite, I don't know what the word is, ironic.

369
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,980
 So this, if at punctuation two, we were just about to celebrate the very end of lockdown

370
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,180
 forever.

371
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,700
 And Liz was stuck in her flat unable to go out for coffee.

372
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,780
 I mean, let's not.

373
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,460
 I mean, we all hope that Liz will not be stuck in our house for ages.

374
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,900
 Ah, but yes.

375
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,540
 So punctuation two is basically the dead dog party of lockdown.

376
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,820
 So come and have one big last hurrah before Covid goes forever because Boris Johnson told

377
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
 it to.

378
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,540
 I think it might be quite sarcastic at this point.

379
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,460
 I don't think we think this is the end of restrictions forever, but it might be the end

380
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,540
 of restrictions for a while.

381
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,860
 It might be the start of a nice, mostly unrestricted summer.

382
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,180
 And so let's do that by, you know, also indoors on our computer for weekend.

383
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,220
 But yes, we want to hear, you know, we want, we like to hear from people, what did you

384
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,100
 think worked really nicely punctuation one and we should do again?

385
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,060
 What was we should never do it again?

386
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,060
 Yeah.

387
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,220
 And, you know, we'll be asking for ideas of fun things and especially since it will be

388
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,020
 June and not November, there may be exciting things you can do outside your house.

389
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,860
 And we are working on a couple of things which will be strict upgrades from the first

390
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,940
 punctuation, but we're not going to tell you what they are yet in case they don't work.

391
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,860
 And we will be doing a non-legally binding consultative referendum on some different

392
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,220
 options we're throwing around with regards to exactly how we run our tech stack and what

393
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,700
 people would find the most accessible slash the most usable.

394
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,380
 So and again, that will be going out in the same email as the announcement that we've

395
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,940
 opened our registrations to punctuation one members.

396
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,780
 And we will also be posting to that in the anonymous Claire Discord.

397
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,140
 So if you would like to join the consultation, you will see it when it is ready.

398
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,500
 I think that's everything on punctuation too.

399
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
 Ah, yeah.

400
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 Come along.

401
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
 It'll be fun.

402
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 Yeah.

403
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
 We're going to have fun.

404
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,700
 We're looking forward to it.

405
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,780
 Start planning your breakfasts now.

406
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,420
 Yeah, start planning your meet.

407
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,980
 So one of my big takeaways from virtual conventions was the big takeaways are good at virtual

408
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
 conventions.

409
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,500
 So you should definitely start planning your big takeaways.

410
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,420
 I recommend kibab.

411
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,220
 Yeah, I also recommend kibab.

412
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,100
 And this recommends some Thai thing that we can't get here, which is very tasty apparently.

413
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
 Yeah, probably.

414
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,820
 I mean, probably multiple options to that.

415
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,740
 But I was a bit jealous because fried breakfasts are not a huge thing.

416
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,860
 And it's much harder to get like nice bacon and sausages.

417
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,660
 So I would come to the breakfast thing, which to me would be a mid-afternoon and everyone

418
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:55,340
 would be like tucking into the delicious full English and I'd be drinking a cup of coffee.

419
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,180
 No player, no.

420
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,860
 Banana humus is what caused that spontaneous outburst from Liz.

421
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
 We still don't have a chair.

422
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,380
 Oh, we should say we have extra people on the committee this time.

423
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,540
 We definitely should have said that.

424
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,460
 This time we have a committee of six people, all mad gaming fans.

425
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,460
 The centre of gravity of the punctuation committee was not sufficiently based in South London.

426
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,980
 And to rectify this, we have added two people to address the balance.

427
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,460
 And that is Claire Briley and Mark Plummer of Croydon.

428
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,420
 You may recognise them from their locks.

429
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,540
 We're happy to have them on the team.

430
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,260
 They have good ideas and they will make punctuation too better than it would be without them.

431
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,020
 So thank you very much to both of them for volunteering.

432
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,900
 They will certainly make it better punctuated.

433
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
 They will.

434
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,940
 Doesn't that mean that the central gravity of the convention is now somewhere about western

435
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,940
 Greece?

436
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,300
 Yeah, but that is more South London than it was before.

437
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,620
 I'll calculate it.

438
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,460
 Yeah, this will calculate it.

439
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
 Oh god.

440
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,340
 There are Python scripts to do this sort of thing probably.

441
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:06,860
 So on the subject of virtual conventions, Swankon has had to cancel their convention the

442
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,500
 day before it was due to start due to a three day lockdown.

443
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,020
 For those who don't know.

444
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,380
 Swankon is the convention of Perth in Australia.

445
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:24,660
 And we would like to note that Swankon announced the day before that they were not going to

446
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,660
 be running a convention and they had time to do some online programme items.

447
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,060
 Not every convention has found that they have had time to do online programme items with

448
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,140
 a similar lead time.

449
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,180
 I am hugely impressed by that because I feel desperately sorry for them, especially if

450
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:49,780
 you were doing all that planning and then literally the day before you have to just...

451
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,500
 Yeah, I think they're postponing.

452
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,220
 They'll be able to run it quite soon I think, but it must be an important shot for them.

453
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,580
 We're very sorry.

454
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,700
 We hope that the rescheduled Swankon is amazing and we are very sorry to anyone who is going

455
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,460
 because that sucks.

456
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,580
 And on the subject of postponing conventions, look at these seamless segues guys, "Disc

457
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,380
 on three are changing their dates to December for my birthday."

458
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,740
 Yeah, we'd have talked about this two weeks ago, but we were too busy talking about these

459
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
 two gone two weeks ago.

460
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,980
 So yes, "disc on" is now a live action convention in December.

461
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,580
 I think this says there may still be some hybrid elements as well.

462
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,060
 There will be some hybrid elements.

463
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,620
 And it's the weekend before Christmas, which I have to say guys, removes any lingering

464
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,140
 chance I was going to be able to get to it.

465
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,540
 Yeah, I'm also not planning to attend, I don't think.

466
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,940
 Although if I hear a sad noise from a spandere in the other room, maybe I will change my mind

467
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
 to life on air.

468
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
 We'll see.

469
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,700
 I mean, right now it's moot because none of us are allowed into the US right now, I think.

470
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,260
 Anyway, so really given we don't know when that will shift, I'm not sure whether August

471
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,740
 to December makes a big change to that.

472
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,620
 I think people who don't like hot weather will be much happier with the December date.

473
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,780
 Yes, I think you might be right.

474
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,060
 It would be that cold.

475
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,900
 It would probably just be quite cold.

476
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,780
 But I calibrate everything on a different scale now.

477
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,780
 That's not really the most important.

478
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,100
 I think, oh, they've even got, actually there is a frequently asked questions about what

479
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,060
 is the weather like in mid-December.

480
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,340
 So I'm cleaning up the only person worrying about that.

481
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,900
 And the answer is bloody awful, right?

482
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,140
 Now the answer is high of seven and low of one on average.

483
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
 That's fine.

484
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,660
 Which is, you know, chilly, quite cold.

485
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,900
 Couple of jumpers.

486
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,660
 It's bringing my proper coat weather.

487
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,620
 Yeah, there's no such thing as bad weather, there's just bad clothing.

488
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,060
 So you'll be inside all we can, so, yeah.

489
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:56,980
 And this has raised questions about the deadline for site selection, says Kevin Stanley on

490
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
 Dreamwidth.

491
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,580
 We've put a link in the show notes if you would like to read about that.

492
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,220
 I, um, yes, I had thoughts, but I forgot them.

493
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,700
 Or more accurately, I decided they were too tedious to say out loud.

494
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:19,060
 Yeah, I think Kevin's basically said they should reopen site selection and everyone else

495
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,980
 has said they're there, Kevin.

496
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,380
 I think that's, is that right?

497
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,060
 I think that's right.

498
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,060
 So I think I can see where he's coming from on a principal stand basis.

499
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,480
 The other thing that's happened while we were talking about Eastercon was that Baines

500
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,500
 Bar returned with all of its odd posts intact.

501
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:46,740
 And with a note from Tony Vyskoff saying that she'd reviewed them and didn't think

502
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,780
 there was a problem with them.

503
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,060
 So that's a thing.

504
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:57,140
 I feel like this is now sitting around being a issue for fandom that is unlikely to go away,

505
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,060
 that it's going to continue to cause us trouble.

506
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,420
 But we'll see.

507
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,300
 And Mike Gloyer wrote about this and we've got a link in the show notes, but I do think

508
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,580
 that, um, I don't know if Liz and Nalison agree with me here, but I do think that now

509
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,180
 that she's been like, Oh, no, all of this was fine.

510
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:21,940
 She's like, yeah, you should not have been the discount three guest of order.

511
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,860
 And that was probably the right decision.

512
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,700
 I know it's said to horrible precedent.

513
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,420
 And I know it's like very much not something we've done traditionally, but dang.

514
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,660
 Yeah, I suspect the Discon committee who had to make that difficult decision are probably

515
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,900
 feeling better.

516
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
 Yeah.

517
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,140
 I think that's about it.

518
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,580
 I think that's fine.

519
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,700
 The other thing about the about Discon moving its dates to December, look at our amazing

520
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:55,740
 segues, is that it means that we've got much longer for our Hugo reading and watching and

521
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,420
 for the very first time playing.

522
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,660
 So reactions to the Hugo finalists.

523
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,780
 Congratulations to John for his Hugo finalists spot for Journey Planet.

524
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,380
 We're very proud of him.

525
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
 Thank you.

526
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,380
 Hey.

527
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:17,020
 And congratulations to everyone else who was a finalist or is a finalist or was a finalist

528
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,460
 or will be your finalist in the future.

529
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
 Oh, no.

530
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
 Okay.

531
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,900
 In that case, I was in the past, but who knows?

532
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,540
 No, so we have a couple of broad thoughts.

533
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,260
 We're not going to go massively into the weeds or the Hugo Awards, because, you know, because

534
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,500
 we're going to do that next episode or maybe the one after there will be an episode when

535
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,740
 we go massively into the weeds.

536
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
 Yeah.

537
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,740
 At some point, quite a lot of episodes, really.

538
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,660
 We've got we've got time.

539
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,660
 It's not so December.

540
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,660
 We've got ages.

541
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,900
 Yeah, we could just fill the entire podcast with Hugo, Nerdary from now until December.

542
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,020
 An episode per category.

543
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,660
 I could can I have an episode just for Hades, please, because I can fill an entire episode

544
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,820
 with Hades, Nerdary.

545
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,820
 Um, yes, possibly.

546
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:11,820
 Octa-thop, it would be less och-thop gaming corner and more just och-thop at that point.

547
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,260
 Um, so, um, so some top level thoughts about the Hugo's.

548
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,380
 Firstly, I did a lot of reading this year in preparation with the Hugo's with the net effect

549
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,620
 that I'm quite a lot further along with my fiction reading than I am usually, which is

550
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620
 nice.

551
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,100
 Uh, and in general, I've been enjoying that.

552
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:34,300
 But my two overarching thoughts are, um...

553
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,980
 Sorry, can I have a poll, please?

554
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,980
 Because I always say overarching.

555
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,500
 Oh, overarching?

556
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,000
 Over-arching.

557
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,540
 And because of arches, but I understand that it's one of these difficult prefixes because

558
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:53,620
 obviously it's arkin, archangel, and arkin archaeology, but arch in archbishop.

559
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,180
 And in archive.

560
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,180
 Archbishop, or...

561
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,260
 But they're just called that because they're very sarcastic.

562
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,340
 And so I don't know what the...

563
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
 Archum.

564
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,340
 You should see, yes.

565
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,260
 That's what happens when we are reading the chat while doing it.

566
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,260
 I would say overarching with Alison.

567
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,260
 So, Hugo, John, out of it.

568
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,260
 Okay.

569
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,980
 I'm gonna have to just say overarching a lot and then Eddy Stitihin, where you two have

570
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,260
 said that to make it sound back for Alessa.

571
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,620
 That's annoying.

572
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,100
 I think the best game category is really good.

573
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,220
 And the reason I think this is because it is six games, none of which are all indie darlings

574
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,620
 and are all AAA games or are all big old PlayStation games.

575
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,540
 You know, there's a huge breadth in just the six titles that has really shown, I think,

576
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:46,460
 how much there is in the genre from the massive remakes of beloved games for your kind of

577
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,340
 hardcore PlayStation gamers.

578
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:55,300
 And then also a nice little browser game where you bet on baseball with black holes and there's

579
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,020
 like a whole narrative around that, which is a bit strange.

580
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,020
 And I really, I'm playing Spirit of Fair as the moment, I'm really enjoying it.

581
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,460
 And yeah, I'm super impressed with how broad the best game category is.

582
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,620
 And it's already more vibrant than several of the categories that have been around for

583
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,500
 a lot longer than it.

584
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,780
 And I have a beef to pick with the Hugo's because I had been avoiding buying Hades ever

585
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,620
 since my son said to me, "Oh, Mum, you would really like this game.

586
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,860
 It's a persistent roguelike of the sort that you drop into and then neither eat nor sleep

587
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,860
 for weeks on end."

588
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,020
 And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, you're quite right.

589
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,300
 I'm just not touching it with the barge pole."

590
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:40,140
 And then it got turned up on the Hugo ballot and I was like, "Oh, this is an excuse."

591
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:45,900
 And so if I owe you anything, if I haven't done something I said I'd do, if I've been,

592
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:52,260
 if I missed a major organizational meeting for your convention, if I did any of these

593
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,660
 things any time in the last two weeks I'm very sorry.

594
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,580
 Whatever she said, whatever she did, she didn't mean it.

595
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
 I did.

596
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,780
 It's, I'm really, really enjoying this game there.

597
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,500
 Ha ha ha ha.

598
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,620
 Allison's doing the Hugo voter pack this year so I'm looking forward to her giving me

599
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,100
 a free copy of this game later in the year.

600
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,260
 That's not part of my responsibilities.

601
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
 Boo!

602
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,740
 Um, is it possible to pay for, pay for Blaiseball?

603
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,740
 Have I?

604
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,940
 No, I don't think it is possible to pay for Blaiseball.

605
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,340
 Yeah, so, so, so we actually have everything from a, you know, a, a triple-a game on a

606
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,860
 playstation through to a game you play in your browser for nothing and I, I think that's

607
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
 quite good.

608
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,940
 I am similarly pleased to see a wide variety of stuff on there.

609
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:42,580
 I was slightly surprised not to see Cyberpunk 2077 which despite all the bugs seem to have

610
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,620
 been a quite well received game but maybe it came out quite late in the year and people

611
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,620
 didn't own it.

612
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,180
 I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit sad because I would like to play all these games but I

613
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:57,980
 actually only have the hardware to play four out of six and I've never played a Final

614
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,700
 Fantasy game and I'd be quite interested in playing it but it is still extremely expensive.

615
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,580
 Jon is waving a hand at me.

616
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,020
 I think you can play five out of six.

617
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,020
 Can I?

618
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,100
 Yeah, because I think Spirit of Eris and Hades are both on playstation.

619
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,740
 Hades is not on playstation.

620
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,740
 What?

621
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,860
 Oh, but it's on Steam.

622
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,020
 The more general point is, very few of the Hugo voters are actually going to have the

623
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,140
 kit to play all six of these games because it does require you to have both a Switch

624
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,420
 and a playstation 4.

625
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,460
 True.

626
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:34,180
 And that's quite a big ask and I think that's something that separates it from most of

627
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:42,580
 the Hugo categories where we can expect most voters to be able to access all of the games

628
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,860
 and I think there was some suggestion when we suggested this before that let's plays

629
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,420
 might be the solution to that but I don't think they are because they're not the same.

630
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:58,940
 I think they might be for a couple of them not naming the last of us two explicitly.

631
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
 I just wanted to come back.

632
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,020
 So you mentioned Cyberpunk 2077.

633
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:08,700
 I'm not sure that in the Hugo voters wheelhouse you know, I'm not sure that the Hugo voters

634
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:17,900
 are historically known except for certain bad actors for supporting works which are quite

635
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,820
 as undiverse as that game turned out to be shall we say.

636
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,740
 And so I am entirely unsurprised that Hugo Electric chose not to reward it.

637
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,660
 And to be fair, I think that was the right decision.

638
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,500
 But as always it will be very interesting seeing the other things that were nominated

639
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,020
 when the full when the long list comes out in December we have to wait till December.

640
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,620
 Oh I am told about that.

641
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,500
 We do it's so annoying if Kevin Sandley wants to have opinions he should have opinions on

642
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:53,100
 releasing the full list in August anyway like I happen to need his stats.

643
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,940
 I'm sure that's enough games chaps otherwise we'll start losing our audience won't we.

644
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,740
 Hey Mark's already written us a lock during the recording so.

645
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,940
 He did that before we started talking about games though and it's about games so you know.

646
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,460
 It is about games.

647
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,860
 I've got a tiny tiny tiny bit more on games sorry because not only would I have to have

648
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,300
 like all I basically would need a playstation and a switch to play this but also the last

649
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,340
 of us part two is still I think better part 45 quid.

650
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:26,580
 The final fantasy remake is still 40 quid so like it's not an hour we need these but the

651
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,540
 investment to actually play the games in this category is about 100 quid it's it's a big

652
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,540
 thing.

653
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,340
 I am going to tell you how the young gamers play these games which is that they buy them

654
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,300
 from their local second hand game shop and then they sell them back to their local second

655
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,260
 hand game shop so you know for a total cost of about a fiver so I don't think that's

656
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,060
 a I don't think that's insane.

657
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:52,100
 Yeah I hadn't thought of that but I might have to get myself down to CEX once once lockdown

658
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,580
 eases a bit more and see if I can pick up cheap copies.

659
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,380
 I understand it's pronounced sex.

660
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:06,100
 On this podcast it's not this is a family show a family show family show Alison.

661
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,700
 It used to be that if you phone them up you'd get the person answering the phone would say

662
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,900
 you've reached the sex helpline how can we help you something which has irritated me

663
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,940
 ever since I discovered it.

664
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,980
 So it pleased me to see a place ball on the list actually because that's one of the games

665
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,100
 that I've heard described as basically the game is one thing but really everyone's playing

666
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,540
 for the emerging emergent narrative around it.

667
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,180
 I think that is very interesting because we had discussions about emerging narratives

668
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,860
 and things in games on previous episodes.

669
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,540
 No and the current season of of plays ball is sponsored by a convention that focuses

670
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:47,820
 on Ludo narrative and I think yes it is clear that an awful lot of the enjoyment of the

671
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,980
 game is not actually the mechanics of the game which is really interesting and it kind

672
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,900
 of reminds me of the Marble Olympics but like I think a lot of that to do with emergent

673
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,820
 narrative as well rather than it yeah there's a lot to talk about there I think and also

674
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,060
 like some novels and stuff got nominated.

675
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:10,140
 Oh yeah who tells stories by writing them down on paint like what like come on guys it's

676
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,380
 2021 strap on a graphics card let's get this baby going.

677
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,500
 A quite novel just in case anyone is about to write in.

678
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,300
 Yeah I'm also trying to watch the all the best dramatic presentation nominees because

679
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,340
 I should manage to do that despite not paying a lot of attention to television generally

680
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,940
 some of them are the short fixed the short form ones are kind of episodes of things so

681
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,980
 that probably requires me to watch quite a lot of things to get to the relevant episode.

682
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:45,580
 I've already seen all of the best long form contenders except for Tenet and if that is

683
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:51,420
 still the case when votes close I won't regard it as a huge problem.

684
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,580
 Everything I've heard about Tenet makes me reluctant to spend the amount of money to

685
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,620
 actually like purchase it so if it doesn't come on a free streaming service between now

686
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,860
 and then it is unlikely that I will watch it in time for the Hugo's unless it's in the

687
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,780
 Hugo Voto packet and Alison gives me a free copy.

688
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,380
 I think it's most unlikely to be in the Hugo Voto packet.

689
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,380
 True.

690
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,020
 Doctor who might be was last year.

691
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,780
 I think there is a chance that some of the short forms will be better don't think any

692
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,220
 of the long forms will be historically they have not been.

693
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,180
 Richard says that her old job they had fire assembly points hopefully labelled on the maps

694
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,820
 as FAP in reassuringly large letters.

695
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,900
 Okay, what's next on the show notes?

696
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,620
 Are you done with games?

697
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,460
 Are we ever done with games?

698
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,660
 I think Mark Plone would argue no.

699
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,460
 But yes I think so.

700
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,340
 I was going to say Tenet is the only one of the long forms I've actually seen and I

701
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,620
 mean I did enjoy it but I did go and see it in the cinema having not been to see a film

702
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:45,460
 in the cinema for many months because they were closed so I did enjoy it that way.

703
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,500
 You do have to turn your brain off a bit and I missed about a quarter of the dialogue

704
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,780
 I think because it's very hard to hear and I'm not sure if that helped or hindered my

705
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,100
 enjoyment of the film.

706
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:01,500
 So I might watch again just with the subtitles on to see if it's any more enjoyable.

707
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
 That's fair.

708
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:09,460
 If you are interested in watching the best long-form Mac presentation finalists then you can come

709
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:14,740
 along to the snark-long channel on the anonymous Claire Discord where there are discussions

710
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:20,020
 of such things and you can discuss them with us.

711
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,100
 We've been with Watcht Palm Springs so far.

712
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,660
 I don't think we've watched any of this have we?

713
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
 Not a snark-along no.

714
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,700
 I mean snark-along has watched other things but in true snark-long form where we have

715
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:38,780
 chatted over the film whereas for me at least I'm going to watch the BDP finalists without

716
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,740
 having people talking over them at the time.

717
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,340
 Except for you and Stephen.

718
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:50,620
 I mean I think it's kind of okay still to have one person on the sofa going "What's that

719
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,620
 about?"

720
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:59,020
 Is that the same character as that one earlier and you go "They're both clean-cut white American

721
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,340
 men in their early 20s and are therefore indistinguishable?"

722
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:07,900
 The Warhammer 40,000 movie Ultramarine is an animated movie where everyone is exactly

723
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,140
 the same white guy and that was enormously difficult to follow.

724
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,020
 It did not find its way onto the Hugo Ballot for some reason.

725
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,020
 Shockingly.

726
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,500
 Has there ever been a good game based movie to discuss?

727
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,940
 Or we should talk about that sometime in...

728
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,140
 There has.

729
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,300
 Golden Eye, the James Bond film.

730
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
 Mm-hmm.

731
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,060
 Wasn't the game afterwards?

732
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,300
 Some people have argued that.

733
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,300
 Yeah.

734
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,300
 But what even is time?

735
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,300
 Okay.

736
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,020
 So apart from Minesweeper the trailer which I would argue with.

737
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,660
 Ah yes now.

738
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,020
 We really are off topic.

739
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,100
 I'm so sorry guys.

740
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,460
 The detective Pikachu is quite good.

741
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
 In actual fact.

742
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,180
 I know it sounds like I'm trolling but I genuinely enjoyed that movie.

743
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:56,820
 Yeah no, people say that's very good.

744
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,320
 Firecom.

745
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,480
 Doing things.

746
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,180
 Alison's bought a ticket.

747
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
 Lizzamy bought a ticket.

748
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,460
 Yeah I could go last year so I have because they sold out by the time I tried to join.

749
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,580
 So this year I have joined.

750
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,220
 I will probably go to it.

751
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,220
 Um.

752
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,220
 Yeah.

753
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,700
 I think it's worth saying that last year they had limited tickets.

754
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,740
 Um and so I didn't buy one last year because I would not have been able to attend which

755
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,740
 is a convention.

756
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,300
 I did buy a ticket for the fringe which is explicitly in my time zone which was very

757
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,700
 good and was free.

758
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,180
 I might buy a ticket this year because since they're unlimited this year I don't feel

759
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,700
 I'm taking away a ticket from someone who could make better use of it.

760
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
 Um.

761
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,700
 That makes sense.

762
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
 Yeah.

763
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,980
 Do they do programming in your time zone which is not adorated?

764
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,980
 Sorry.

765
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,980
 Programming am I?

766
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,420
 I said it was explicitly in your time zone.

767
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,020
 I was just wondering if there's any non explicit content in your time zone.

768
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:50,140
 What I love about this is the audience finally gets to see your reactions to my jokes like

769
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,060
 on your faces and they get to understand why I have such a good time.

770
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,060
 Yeah.

771
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,500
 Um we have many people in the chat saying that they love Detective Pikachu so I will try

772
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,980
 and watch that at some point.

773
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,740
 And DC says in reaction to my joke tumble read which is fair.

774
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,700
 Is the reaction to a many of George jokes?

775
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,700
 It's true.

776
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,700
 I love being me.

777
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:16,020
 As has been noted the last time FireCon did a convention they had a much smaller pool of

778
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,020
 tickets.

779
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,460
 I mean, definitely because this time it's infinite but also small enough that it's all

780
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,300
 out very quickly.

781
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:27,060
 This time you can donate memberships but we believe they have hit their donation target

782
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,500
 for that but you can still donate to the general fund.

783
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:37,860
 And this is something that Reclamation in 2022 are also doing and we very quickly mentioned

784
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,420
 Reclamation last episode at the very beginning.

785
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,700
 We haven't talked about it a great deal.

786
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,700
 So yes.

787
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,140
 So Reclamation when you sign up the membership is 70 pounds for our attending and different

788
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,820
 prices for other categories which are not the ones I fall into so I didn't look at them

789
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,380
 in great detail.

790
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,300
 But it asks you when you check out whether you would like to add a donation.

791
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:06,180
 The recommended donation is 10 pounds towards letting less able fans, letting fans attend

792
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,780
 who would be less financially able to do so.

793
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:14,220
 Obviously if you can't afford 10 pounds there's no pressure on you to do so like it's entirely

794
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,220
 up to you.

795
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,340
 But I think this is a really good idea and a way of kind of letting the more privileged

796
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:25,020
 of us in the community support the less privileged when it comes to wealth.

797
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,020
 So yeah, well done Reclamation.

798
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,380
 I think this is something that all East Con should be looking at doing.

799
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,820
 I would say that I believe it was a Turbium that had this as well.

800
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,220
 I'm being a bit vague because I can't exactly remember but I think it was a Turbium who also

801
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:43,540
 had a Bursary Fund that you could donate to.

802
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,660
 They had some issues around the bursaries though and I think Reclamation is doing a

803
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,300
 simpler let's just donate memberships rather than granting bursaries with strings attached.

804
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,780
 Yes, I think that just is a much simpler way to implement it.

805
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:02,900
 I was noticing I think Dublin had the fantastic Dublin Fund which had some similar aspects

806
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,780
 and Discon and Chicon both have funds for this as well.

807
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,820
 So I think it's clearly going to be thing World Cons do in the future.

808
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,140
 I quite like the way Discons Warner has basically two aims.

809
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:17,100
 One is getting underrepresented fans into World Cons but the other one is specifically

810
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:23,300
 for local fans who might enjoy it but basically can't come in on a World Cons membership.

811
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,260
 And so it will let them come in and have like a taster of the convention or people who live

812
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:32,420
 locally so they don't need extra funding but just a membership is too much for barrier.

813
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,580
 I think that's quite a nice sort of dual aim especially for a convention that moves around

814
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,580
 every year.

815
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:47,060
 Yes, no and I think I wasn't aware that Itobium had to try to do something similar but I think

816
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:52,100
 like you say having it right there on the Redch Form is really nice so I think that's

817
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,980
 really positive.

818
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,620
 And in general very excited about Reclamation in 2022.

819
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,780
 Great guest of on the list.

820
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,980
 In 2022 has a great guest of honor list.

821
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:08,540
 They have Zencho who I love and they have Mary Robinette Coel who I also love and they

822
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,940
 have Philip Reeve who I love and they have Nicholas White who I love.

823
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,780
 So this is a solid roster in my opinion.

824
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,780
 Yes.

825
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,780
 Yes.

826
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,780
 It's very good.

827
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,780
 Well done lads.

828
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,780
 Yeah, it's very very very solidist.

829
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:30,500
 And I mean by lads I'm using lads and it's British, gender inclusive form.

830
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,500
 Very sorry.

831
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,500
 Yes.

832
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,660
 And also FireCon did publish details about their costs and platforms.

833
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,660
 If you want to know how much it costs to run a virtual convention there will be a link

834
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,500
 in the show notes.

835
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:49,020
 I think FireCon published details of its platforms and it costs shortly after the previous

836
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,900
 Varkon and it was one of the things that I took into account when I was enthusiastic

837
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,220
 about the idea that punctuation would do the same.

838
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,540
 We have not done it any in quite as much details they did but it's good.

839
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,300
 I think it's very useful for conventions to do this to give people who are planning other

840
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:10,700
 conventions a sense of what the really exciting things that they saw actually cost because

841
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:15,460
 sometimes those things are very expensive and sometimes they're not, they're just clever.

842
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:21,660
 So FireCon also announced the nominees of their Ignite Awards which I believe are a set

843
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,780
 of jury nominations from a committee from FireCon which I think this year included some of

844
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,620
 the awardees from the previous year and then they put all the nominees up for a public

845
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,620
 vote.

846
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,740
 So we put a link in the show notes.

847
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,300
 There's some really interesting nominees on there.

848
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,180
 There's some crossover with the Hugo's but there's also some really interesting things on

849
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,180
 there.

850
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,940
 They have more categories as well because they have categories for poetry, a specific year,

851
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,300
 critics award and some community awards.

852
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,140
 So it's worth going over there and checking out all the nominees and then you can vote

853
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,300
 until the 21st of May.

854
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:07,660
 Right, so I have just read all the way through the chat looking for Ask Octathorb questions

855
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,500
 that have not found any so that maybe didn't work.

856
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,540
 Look, right, have we tried checking out Twitter?

857
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:20,980
 There were at least two questions which I spotted and I really should have copied the

858
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,980
 post.

859
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,220
 So we had one for Jerry which is what is the average airspeed velocity of a laden swallow?

860
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,220
 Would that be an African or a European swallow?

861
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:33,740
 I am able to make the correct religious forms here.

862
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,260
 Unlike John who had no idea what that reference was referring to.

863
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,580
 I do have an idea, it's Monty Python.

864
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,660
 I always preferred the series to the movies.

865
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,500
 God I sound like a...

866
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
 Really?

867
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,780
 Because the series has loads of really crap stuff.

868
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,620
 If you actually go and watch it, you go, "Oh, this was a sketch show on the BBC so one

869
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,660
 joke in five is very funny."

870
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:59,900
 What I should say is I'm a fan of the three disc best of the sketch show set which solves

871
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,740
 an awful lot of that problem.

872
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:07,860
 And Claire Brierley from Croydon also asks us, "Where should we stick the iPhone if we want

873
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,220
 to send you the proof you don't want?"

874
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:16,620
 To be fair, that was the one that I decided we wouldn't actually do some last copy of

875
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,620
 the book.

876
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,340
 And I did post in the chat because people were clamoring for a poll of where I should

877
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:27,980
 stick my iPhone but I discovered I cannot do a poll of my own orifices so apologies to

878
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,980
 all of them.

879
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,220
 Okay, so let me set up a poll of John's orifices.

880
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,660
 No, not right.

881
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,820
 Family show guys.

882
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,820
 It doesn't work if I'm the one making it less family, does it?

883
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:46,700
 That was the 30th episode of the Oxford Hall podcast and it's goodbye from me.

884
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,700
 It's goodbye from me.

885
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,940
 And it's goodbye from me.

886
00:49:48,940 --> 00:50:11,260
 I'm using lads wrongly.

887
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,260
 Yeah, okay.

888
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:17,060
 I suppose well done chaps isn't going to do me any better is it?

889
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,420
 Well done everyone.

890
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:23,780
 No, we need to launch a campaign that makes it clear that chaps is gender neutral because...

891
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,660
 Well done guys.

892
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,900
 Guys is less...

893
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,020
 I think chaps is definitely more gender neutral than guys or lads.

894
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:37,380
 The two I've been using are folks and peeps, both of which are absolutely gender neutral

895
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,660
 but I want chaps to be come gender neutral because I like calling people chaps.

896
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,260
 I always use chaps in a gender neutral way until people started saying, "Oh no, do you

897
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,260
 realize it's not gender neutral?"

898
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,940
 I was like, "It really is for me."

899
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,660
 But obviously it's not always interpreted that way so I will try to do better.

900
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:03,900
 Folks and peeps both are but peeps is a trademark so I have to be a bit careful about that.

901
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,940
 Roman suggests team as in the reclamation team which is a good one but I also think

902
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:17,100
 I try to always use chaps in a gender neutral way is maybe the title of the podcast.

903
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,260
 Yeah right, that works.

904
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,100
 I like that.

905
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,940
 Okay.

906
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,420
 I shouldn't say stuff like that now because now John can't cut that bit of complete nonsense

907
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,700
 from the podcast.

908
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,340
 Yes!

909
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,420
 This is what I feed on.

910
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:36,580
 Bridget suggests leather chaps which does solve the problem of people interpreting it

911
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,020
 to me.

912
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,060
 Men but...

913
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,660
 Mini Figs.

914
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,220
 Mini Figs.

915
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,100
 Nice.

916
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,740
 Okay, Mini Figs.

917
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:51,940

920
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,400
 I don't have the same beep in chat now.

921
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,020
 We don't actually recall the beep but every time.

922
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,020
 Beep.
