1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
 I want the left half to shout and cheer.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,440
 Okay, that was pathetic. I now want the right half to shout and cheer a lot louder than that.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:18,000
 Okay, left half. Can you beat the right half off you go?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,880
 Okay, that integrity. I like that.

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:36,880
 [Music]

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,160
 Hello everyone and welcome to Octa Thor the podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott. Liz is we've got a placard for Liz but she's not here.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,800
 Oh, we're revealed. So we have an item of business. We have an item of business. It's long and pointy.

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,160
 Oh, yes, so, yeah. So do you want to bring it up and get your cameras at the ready because this

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,360
 is a photo opportunity. We need to also arrange you for reasons that we'll see. It's Nicholas,

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,680
 come around this way. Nicholas, come around this side. This is an on stage, off stage.

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,480
 So for listeners at home it is April Fool's Day on the day we record and the chapter art for this

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,400
 episode is a wonderful not a Hugo which is not being presented to us which we are not accepting.

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,160
 And it is not being presented to us by our stunt Liz Nicholas-Lite.

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,640
 Oh, oh no, it really is a real hug. It is not a real Hugo.

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:59,200
 That is fantastic. It is absolutely remarkable. It's a marvelous art. So for people on the radio,

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,680
 you can have a look if you see it but I'm going to say a little, oh yeah no, all the way so it

18
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,520
 not allowed to hold it. So one of the jokes I didn't get to the newsletter was there is no polite way

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:18,160
 to polish a Hugo. So we are very excited to be one of the first people to touch Glasgow 2024's

20
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,920
 Hugo based design. I think you've announced that Estelle McCallum Stewart is in the front row of

21
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,480
 this podcast and she is now making faces like she's hiding under the table. There is a Glasgow

22
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,320
 chair under the table. If found please return to us. By Hugo based designer Sarah Felix.

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:49,280
 Can I talk to the object? And also by Vincent Viefmanka. So I'm going to give you a description

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,880
 of this for the radio but so they have taken an act which I think is an actual Peter Western style.

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,680
 It has been, it has been, it has been, it's like they talk about this Hugo. They've taken a real

26
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,080
 Peter Western style Hugo and they have rocket because it's obviously not a Hugo. I need to say

27
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,760
 that. So Esther is that it is a what? A tartan rocket. A tartan rocket and they have dipped it.

28
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,640
 Like they've wrapped it like when you get one of those taxis that advertises just eats.

29
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,680
 Yes and I think the question on the question on everyone's mind is which local businesses will

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,920
 be being advertised on the real heroes. So obviously they've said she's under the table again listeners.

31
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,000
 We've sent her under the table again. We're not nice people. And so they've dipped it in the

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 landing zone tartan which is the actual official tartan as mentioned in the authority of tartans

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,520
 and the tartan, I don't know the tartan times or whatever it's called on that. So yes Nicholas do

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,120
 you want to talk a little bit as our guest about how this came to be? So the basis by

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,240
 Villefranke who designed the San Jose and it is exceptionally beautiful. It has three armadillos

36
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,120
 on it and some books. Yes and we now need to let our guest Nicholas get a word in.

37
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:20,880
 So you will have observed, you have observed that there are three lovely well read armadillos

38
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,680
 here. Two of them in homage to the Duke of Wellington or rather to his statue in Glasgow

39
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,760
 are wearing traffic cones and the third is simply piloting the starship as one does and on the sides

40
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:44,400
 you will see two haguses. Yes. One in dormant state and one in full flying state with its

41
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:52,400
 ceremonial toupee. Curled around the back are an acorn.

42
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:00,640
 So what is the significance of the acorn? The acorn and the two cats are personal to the designers.

43
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,560
 Oh so the acorn is a Villefranke thing. It's a Villefranke thing. And the cat is for

44
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,920
 for Sarah. I believe that's a sign. Sarah could have been here but couldn't quite make it so

45
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:17,920
 it's a shame. Texas is quite far but yeah. On the the plaque on the front says very clearly

46
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:26,800
 Glasgow 2024 happy April Fool's Day, first of April 2024 because this is not a Hugo and we're

47
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,480
 not presenting it to anybody and underneath inscribed oof in the base is the ceremonial inscription

48
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:43,120
 there can be only one. And this is the only one that there will ever be and this is as you said

49
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,640
 quite correctly Alison, this is a thing of total beauty. It is absolutely magnificent.

50
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,000
 I would say that I've seen a lot of real Hugo designs and this is actually better than several

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,480
 of them. I would agree with that. More stylish, more in keeping with the sanctity of the Hugo brand.

52
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,000
 So the actual Hugo base for Glasgow will be quite different but will be also very very good.

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 The listeners can't see the immense look of pleasure on Nicholas's face when he says that but

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,440
 this is a happy happy man. So yes Liz Liz Batty who I think has written to us a couple of times in the

55
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,480
 past points out the Vincent Villefranke also designed the 2013 Hugo base as well as collaborating

56
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,680
 with Sarah on the 2018 base. There will be pictures as I say in the show notes but it is extremely

57
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,280
 beautiful and I assume it will be on display in Glasgow. I believe that's the guess because it

58
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,800
 would be a great shame if people didn't get to see it. But yes, but yes Nicholas hello welcome.

59
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,840
 Hey John, hey Alison, thank you for having me. Thank you for coming on the podcast. We are

60
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,040
 absolutely delighted. You have been on our list of possible stunt visits for some time. Yes,

61
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,200
 for once I'm in the right place at the right time or am I. So what do you want me to say?

62
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,280
 Just tell us how marvellous our podcast is for a bit.

63
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,880
 Well as you know I'm kind of constrained on that one. Yes yes.

64
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:21,200
 So the... That's right. Yes obviously. He cannot comment. I just wonder if you've got any news about

65
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,640
 the podcast that you'd like to share with listeners before I say something about their stuff.

66
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,040
 We are coming to you from Eastacon, Levitation and the Hugo finalists were announced immediately

67
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,440
 after the opening ceremony and amongst very worthy finalists we are one of them and this is very

68
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,120
 exciting. We would like to thank everyone who nominated us. It is a thrill to be sure.

69
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:54,560
 Oh JT for people who are listening on the podcast later. JT has worked out he could

70
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,600
 live stream the discord chat to the big screen in the room. What could possibly go wrong?

71
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:19,840
 I think we probably should say a little bit about our stunt list. So we're absolutely delighted

72
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,760
 that our stunt list this week because Liz is in Thailand is Nicholas White but he is also the

73
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,200
 division head for Wussfuss for the 2024 Wollcon and I think probably we have to say the disclaimer

74
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,240
 now that actually other podcasts are available. Yes absolutely. And then we'll also the administrator

75
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,880
 the Hugo Awards. And it's also the administrator of the Hugo Awards. It's coming together in perfect

76
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,000
 harmony. So yes and the Hugo finalist announcement went without a hitch. It was all very smooth

77
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,680
 and unstressful. It seemed very good. There is a...

78
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:18,640
 The glass go wollcon is now making a health chair fort. Yes. So Nicholas how has...

79
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,160
 So this is a swam thing though. I'm going to say from my vantage point in the audience

80
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,720
 it looked to me like the Hugo announcement went off incredibly well. Yes. I had in fact was what I

81
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,920
 was showing up. I had in fact been told by a number of people in the bar the previous night

82
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,080
 that things might not be quite as perfectly, perfectly smooth as they appeared. I'm not

83
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,520
 I appreciate that. Of course what you see is the swans are readingly gliding along the surface of

84
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,720
 the water and you do not see the little feet paddling subsurface and because it's the Hugo's it's a

85
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:01,440
 swan with three legs not with two. And also also all of the swans in Glasgow for Glasgow 2024 will

86
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,080
 have been dipped in the tartan. Yes it's not a white swan but a tartan swan.

87
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,840
 Are glass weagen swans owned by the king? I'm a Belgian so I cannot answer that question.

88
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,840
 Oh I will say this is off topic but fortunately we've been very on topic.

89
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:25,360
 But I knew Nicholas has... Nicholas has excellent ribbons which have a joke about Belgium on them

90
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
 and I could tell people who had bumped into Nicholas by observing the ribbons. It was like

91
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,520
 all you've seen Nicholas because he knew he had a ribbon. It says on it that's a bit

92
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,000
 undramatic isn't it? So the reason that the ribbon says that's a bit undramatic isn't it?

93
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,360
 This is a doctor who quote those of you who know me may know that I have watched one or two

94
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,960
 Doctor Who episodes in my life and in the episode Time Crash in which Peter Davison encounters David

95
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,760
 Tennant the fifth and tenth doctors meet each other. Peter Davison complains that the collision of the

96
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:05,920
 two tortoises could blow a hole in the space time continuum the exact size of Belgium and then he

97
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,800
 goes on to say that's a bit undramatic isn't it? So I printed these up for Gallifrey one where

98
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:20,000
 indeed you and I met each other most recently John and it's a little silhouette of the map of

99
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,560
 Belgium with the slogan that's a bit undramatic isn't it? So I have many more back in my room I've

100
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,240
 only got one left in my hand but you can come and talk to me afterwards. We had dinner and Nicholas

101
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,880
 knew that well Nicholas was aware of the nominations and kept a straight face and it was very frustrating

102
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,840
 because we were watching him like a hawk fence and there were none. At that point that was mid-February

103
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,920
 so we still had some way to go in voting but I could see the way things were going but it was good.

104
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,040
 But yeah I'll have more to say about the dinner when we get to picks actually.

105
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,880
 Okay very enough. But to say a bit more about the Hugo process the video was just beautifully done

106
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:09,600
 so absolutely props to JT for his and Meg who Meg McDonald who were really at the coalface of

107
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:18,320
 putting it together. We had frustrations we had one very late withdrawal which meant that those

108
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,120
 slides had to be rewritten and re-recorded. I was told he pulled out just in time.

109
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,400
 You're referring...

110
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,960
 I was told the Bigelest Nicholas pulled out just in time.

111
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,960
 I have been told that by multiple people who've been opting.

112
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,920
 It is true that Bigelest Nicholas pulled out but was not perhaps the last to do so but...

113
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,400
 I had not actually had heard that. I'm pretending that I had not heard that because it is better or

114
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:56,800
 it was good that way. But we had the the the great assistance of Sophia Shui in Shanghai who recorded

115
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,760
 half of the categories and the withdrawals category. She is of course a native Mandarin speaker but is

116
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,880
 as you will have heard from the video fluent in English and because we had so many Chinese names

117
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,160
 in the categories I felt it was possibly better to get a native Mandarin speaker to do it rather

118
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,960
 than have to be mangling their names in probably saying something quite offensive without necessarily

119
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:27,200
 intending to which is rather easy to do in some languages. So that that's went very well. We had

120
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:35,840
 great participation from Glasgow's team and from the special guests. I hope you all particularly

121
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,480
 enjoyed the three black halflings. That was a very good... Yes indeed that was great.

122
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,000
 And the presenter who I think probably very few people were expecting to see was Jeffrey Gernsback,

123
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,120
 the great handsome... Yes that was a delight. Tell me who Jeffrey Gernsback is. So Jeffrey Gernsback

124
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,640
 lives quite close to Chicago and he contacted me in advance of the Chicon Worldcon to say that

125
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,840
 he'd hoped he could make it but unfortunate it wasn't going to be possible. So when I heard this I

126
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,440
 said you know how much money would that take? What can we do? How can we get you there?

127
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,000
 It wasn't possible logistically in the end but we stayed in touch. He sent me that lovely photograph.

128
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,120
 He was born about eight months before his great grandfather died. So there's a lovely family

129
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,240
 photograph which you'll see in the video of a very aged Hugo Gernsback, his son Jeff's grandfather,

130
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,840
 his grandson Jeff's father and Jeff's aunt is in the picture as well. So that was just very very

131
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:40,320
 nice. He was absolutely keen to do it and so we're staying in touch as to how we can get the Gernsback

132
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,880
 family perhaps a bit more recognised in the Hugo process than has been the case. I don't think

133
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,200
 there'd really been much connection in the years since Hugo Gernsback died which I think was 1967.

134
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:58,240
 Oh it was very cool. And yeah it's like seven seconds of participation but it's seven seconds

135
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,360
 more than we've had in 50 something years. We have it. So one of the

136
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,520
 the Fancast category was introduced by Tami Coxen and she posted to say that she had chosen

137
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,400
 Fancast because she was hoping that she would get to read our nomination out. So hello Tari,

138
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,560
 that was very sweet. Thank you very much indeed. And she did it behind her cocktail bar and presented

139
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,680
 the Glasgow Gimlet as part of the introduction which was great. But there are a lot of lovely

140
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,040
 little flourishes and I thought like I'm not trying to be facetious like from the outside it seemed

141
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,520
 like everything went off without a hitch. And obviously like you say the three legs of the

142
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:43,840
 mutant swan frantically paddling. We mentioned Bigelas Dicklas for listeners who don't know

143
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,800
 and we'll get on to the people who accepted their finalist slots later but there were five

144
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,640
 people who declined. Martha Wells for System Collapse which is I believe the latest murder bot novel

145
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,320
 Haya for the far north. Bigelas Dicklas, Natasha Bardon invested in long form and

146
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,520
 Camestros flapped on in Best Fan Writer and I just want to say Bigelas Dicklas is a good egg

147
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,720
 because I think that was the right call. There have been people who accepted for things that I

148
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,680
 would rather have not been on the finalist slate and I'm thinking of you Chris. You know who you are

149
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:25,840
 but I think it's very classy to decline because it's a funny joke but yeah it was quite difficult

150
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,680
 to track Bigelas Dicklas down. Tell us about how you looked for Bigelas Dicklas.

151
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,520
 It was actually I mean I don't think this needed to be a secret it was it was Amal El-Mortar

152
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,200
 one of the authors of this. Oh okay that's. Who made the connection but I think I think

153
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,760
 Bigelas Dicklas being a bit outside the community sent me a rather curious message saying

154
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,440
 are you the Nicholas White who Amal El-Mortar tells me I need to contact and is this about the Hugo

155
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:01,360
 Awards because if so I don't want to be in it. If however you're contacting me for some other

156
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,320
 reason please accept my apologies for the tone of that first paragraph. So I mean that is classy

157
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,840
 I agree. I think that is classy. And it's important to communicate during. I mean I think so we you had

158
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:18,480
 five five withdrawals at the end and I think three people that decline three people that um

159
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,520
 three three that we had to disqualify although one of those had had been nominated separately in

160
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,840
 a different category for which they were eligible. So to to talk about those quickly the three that

161
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,680
 were disqualified were all Chinese. One of them was a novel where the copyright date was December

162
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:44,160
 2023 but my intense research in the Chinese science fiction community made it pretty clear that it

163
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,120
 wasn't in the shops or available and that even the author had not had a copy until 2024 which means

164
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,280
 that under the Hugo Rules it is not eligible and then we had two successful nominees in the

165
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:06,160
 fan cast category but and it made me research the professional criteria because a fan cast

166
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,320
 must be a fan cast and not professional and these were both in fact professional productions and

167
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,280
 they they accepted that when I explained the rules to them. I will um I will look forward to getting

168
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,520
 the Hugo Longlist which I think I'm getting I'm getting at the party this year right which has

169
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,400
 last got intended um I'll look forward to seeing which of those ones would have knocked us off the

170
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:33,280
 ballot. No comment. Yes that is entirely fair and I think there was worry there was there was

171
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,760
 there was commentary when when Glasgow announced the tack they were going to take with um declaring

172
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,080
 who had declined and who was ineligible. I think they was worried it would over shit um over shit.

173
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,920
 That will probably be lovely. It would shit all over the other finalists but I don't think they

174
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,920
 felt shut on at all. What's your opinion Nicholas? The feedback has been positive as all I would say

175
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,960
 but I mean it's it's a fair point a couple of those who declined kind of said why do you need to even

176
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,200
 make it public that we were involved with the ballot in in any way um to which the answer is that

177
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,600
 people people voted for you and they need to know what happened to those votes and unfortunately

178
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,520
 from that perspective the Hugo's belonged to the voters they don't actually belong to the finalists

179
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,600
 and I think that's a really important principle that um you know there's a limit to how far voters

180
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,440
 wishes should be ignored or not reported and I'm very committed to making sure that voters know

181
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,400
 what has happened and can see what's been done with their votes. That's fantastic actually thank you

182
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,000
 and I think so we always used we've done this we've had this transparency for a very long time we

183
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,400
 we we're just going to draw a a gentle veil over the 2023 Hugo's for the purpose of this book

184
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,240
 but we've had this very long standing tradition of releasing this data after the after the ceremony

185
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,840
 but I think bringing it forward is quite a bold move from Glasgow and I think you probably did

186
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,440
 have to do that as a result of what happened last year. The the secret that not many people have

187
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,760
 noticed is we actually did this my first year administering the Hugo's in 2017 in Finland and we

188
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,120
 actually published that year we published withdrawals and disqualifications. Yeah but you did it in

189
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,400
 Finnish so nobody noticed it. That's fair that's fair and I remember I remember recording the thing

190
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,640
 Helsinki airportions yeah I think no one's going to remember this and indeed you didn't so

191
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:35,520
 Hey guys man we have a we do have a terrible memory I mean I speak myself. We weren't doing the

192
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,480
 podcast I will say since we started the podcast our memories have been absolutely

193
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,520
 invaluable yes no I mean if you say oh you mentioned this on episode 23 we will definitely

194
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,320
 remember that isn't that right John. There is there was a there was hilarious statement made there is a

195
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,680
 there is a discord for fans of the Wussfuss business meeting and I am in it as a sort of

196
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,160
 person who would like the business meeting to go away so what was that a bad actor in that discord

197
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,640
 but um but there was someone who said Alison said this on this episode and I said no I have

198
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
 never said that in my life it was definitely Liz and then I checked the transcripts and it was

199
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,360
 Alison and she said it verbatim how they transcribed it and I was like no Alison you did say that

200
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,720
 it was only two episodes ago as well it wasn't like ever so you know um so yes so Nicholas you

201
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,200
 you are someone has posted in the chat saying you know almost as much about the Hugo's as Liz

202
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,720
 so that is high praise it is high praise she's probably more upstate with her recent research than

203
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,920
 I am I actually want before we move off the topic of the Hugo nominations I wanted to say something

204
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,720
 more about them which is that there are quite a lot of to my mind good ones I know that Nicholas

205
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:50,640
 can't comment apart from say all Hugo he loves all his finalists equally deeply and does not pick

206
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,080
 favorites but I was delighted to see some of the people on the um list do and were you yeah most

207
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,000
 people were delighted to see there was one person in fan art is 12 I was like I don't know

208
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:11,680
 really sorry a spanya it's okay it's okay she was not hilarious is a spaniel was distracted at

209
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,960
 that boat so she's gonna have to listen to the episode to find out the burn um but no so so for

210
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,400
 those who don't know Alison uh Alison my learned co-host and ispania my lovely wife were both

211
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:31,760
 nominated in fan artist and obviously a big big booster of that and and ispania and Anna in the

212
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,320
 chat have both said they're all good finalists Brent and that is the official key there's that's

213
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,720
 the official Glasgow line I think and you might also be the official octal line we'll probably have a

214
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,360
 we'll have to think about it over the next two weeks and think about the things that we are

215
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,040
 tragically sad we're not nominated and talk about sorry we the things that we are tragically

216
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,480
 sad were not finalists um I will say that there were three categories where there was like one

217
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,880
 vote in it at the end yeah whether the the next but one candidate would have been on with one

218
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,960
 three two years ago two years ago three years ago three years ago twenty four years ago do I hear

219
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,160
 five years twenty twenty one I was I was asked to do some work for disco three by dickolas

220
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,760
 and um and I said you know this might be really difficult if if octal thought was nominated we

221
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:27,520
 were very new podcast at the time and he said well you haven't been but you know you should make sure

222
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,760
 that you all three of you and all three of you partners nominated because yeah you wrote me a

223
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,840
 week by one we had a we had a frank discussion because obviously self-promotion is gosh

224
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,320
 but um there was a conversation where we're like Alison was like well obviously I didn't

225
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,240
 nominate us and I was like if we don't nominate us with how can we expect anyone else to nominate

226
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,600
 us and I'm like I'm British and you don't vote for yourself and I have been persuaded actually by um

227
00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:00,320
 by John who said if you don't buy two things really one is John who said if if you don't self-promote

228
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,920
 then then people from other countries who shall be nameless who were brought up to self-promote

229
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,760
 from an early age will get all the war awards and British people who would rather die in a

230
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,680
 ditch than say that their own stuff is good will never get any of the awards and then two more things

231
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,600
 three things sorry the second thing was the secret zoom am I allowed to talk about the secret zoom

232
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,880
 well we yes no but we should introduce it we should do that as the last thing and we should

233
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,160
 segue oh the second thing or the third thing because the second thing

234
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:37,440
 Emily ink pen um I'm going to credit for the person who alerted me to this idea suggested in

235
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,320
 the bsfa discord you if you're a member of the bsfa should be in that discord it's now quite good

236
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:49,280
 um but she suggested that British people should find a buddy who really really like you like their

237
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,760
 stuff and they really really like your stuff um hello ispania and and you should and you should

238
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,240
 go and big up their stuff and they should big up your stuff and then it won't feel so bad and on

239
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,440
 that topic everyone should rank first in best related work uh all these worlds reviews and essays

240
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:14,560
 by Neil Harrison Neil has joined Esther Neil is under the table Esther is in front of him they are

241
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,680
 both um so what we're saying here is Esther and Neil are under the table together

242
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,200
 Neil's quite tall so whereas it was quite easy for Esther to hide under the table

243
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,080
 Neil's quite tall but Esther isn't i'm not like yet but so easy for Esther to hide under

244
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:42,720
 that now there's so much chapter off this episode now i think i think i think i think

245
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,560
 Emily's idea in the bsfaity squad is very good and i think the thing i will say is you don't

246
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,480
 necessarily have self-promote but i have started trying to boost other British people who don't

247
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,040
 self-promote because i do think if if no one promotes anyone in Britain that is a shame because

248
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,520
 there are some good things here can you give me an example of something you've been promoting

249
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,360
 Alison Scott for fan artists you should also rank her high at the top of your wallet

250
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,520
 Alison is now under the table

251
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:17,840
 well you are that's not that uncomfortable he's to call actually um but the other thing that

252
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:25,520
 happened Nicholas Nicholas is someone who cares i think quite a lot about the Hugo Awards

253
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,160
 i think it's uncontroversial to say and one of the things that Glasgow has done is they actually

254
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,280
 had a zoom call that all the finalists were invited to that had sort of people talking about

255
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,520
 basically what it's like to be nominated how you might want self-promote there were talks

256
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,240
 for various people mary robinette kowel came to talk to everyone and it was really nice

257
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,000
 um so yeah Nicholas what brought that about like i think it's a great idea but it was an evolution

258
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,120
 i i had hoped that we would have a public town hall about the whole Hugo process

259
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,320
 and then there were certain personnel changes in our team which meant that the work was

260
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,880
 the work was shared a bit more intensely between those of us who who were who remained on it

261
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,040
 and we just into the bandwidth to do an open public town hall before the

262
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:22,080
 nomination before voting closed um that still meant that when we brought on um our ace crack

263
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:30,240
 Hugo fineless liaison head roundy shepherd passed this idea onto him former will conchair roundy

264
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,760
 shepherd yeah a former world conchair roundy shepherd and the first thing he said was well

265
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,880
 let's let's just do this for the Hugo fineless at this point time was rather

266
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,040
 was getting very very tight and the invitations went out went out with less than 48 hours notice

267
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,840
 which is tighter than i would have liked it to be but you deal with the circumstance you have

268
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,080
 and in the event i thought i'm glad you thought it went well i have the sense it was going well as

269
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,440
 well we thought it was delicious we we spent an entire hour in discord with a list of the

270
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,880
 participants in that zoom chat working out who must have been nominated for what you go

271
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,440
 yes we we we started with there was one participant on the zoom whose name on zoom was gong

272
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,040
 wandering earth producer and we thought maybe that meant wandering earth two might have been

273
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,240
 nominated so we started with that and then i got a DM on the zoom from jerry salivar at which

274
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,760
 point i completely lost it because i am unlike unlike lichlus i do not have to be partisan

275
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,440
 i am absolutely thrilled that jerry has been nom uh is a finalist for idea which is

276
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,040
 not only is it a proper real fancy that is like you can actually get a print copy of

277
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,920
 but also i'm in it i want to ask i want to ask nicholas question from the audience

278
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:52,880
 is it a greater honor in your opinion to be the hugo administrator or the stunt liz

279
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,840
 feel free not to answer if it will cause an international incident i mean i i think this the

280
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,920
 sixth time i've been involved with the hugos but it's probably the one and only time in my life

281
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,480
 that i will be a stunt liz so it's just impossible to compare the two experiences

282
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,480
 excellent and it was it was steward steward thank you steward for that thank you steward for that

283
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,760
 not all the questions somebody in the chat was taking was laying bets on who the stunt liz would

284
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,200
 be and i'm just going to say one of the people he suggested was somebody was being stunt liz before

285
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,840
 and that's not going to happen and the other person he suggested was the number one

286
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,360
 person who will never ever be stunt liz because he keeps turning us down so you know just just

287
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,240
 to finish on the the finalists zoom we will also do the public town hall model has not gone away

288
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,120
 and we hope that we will do public town halls on all three of the areas of the westfors division

289
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,360
 for glasco which is to say the not just the hugos but also site selection and the business meeting

290
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,560
 so that's really and that that public i'm really looking forward to public town halls on the

291
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,960
 business meeting that that's me because that that will go really that will go really smoothly and

292
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,600
 there won't be any controversy versus all sounds will it be okay for me to turn up to the town halls

293
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,040
 on the business meeting wearing a robe and having a bell and just shouting "shame"

294
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,160
 i mean i'm not in charge of code of conduct questions but

295
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:20,480
 we're has been pointed out in the chat that we said all bsfa members should join the bsfa discord

296
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,320
 but in fact it is open to all so everyone should join the bsfa discord and it's good yeah i'd

297
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,080
 also everyone should join the bsfa because you know it's the bsfa because it's good too yes it's

298
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,800
 also good but the bsfa awards have this charming thing going back to something you mentioned earlier

299
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,120
 where you're not actually allowed to vote for yourself and i think that's really cute i think

300
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,680
 it's i think it's a bit silly as well but it's very cute the other thing i was going to say about

301
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,320
 the um yes but we're british so obviously one of the things about brit let's see you don't vote

302
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,320
 for yourself proud belgian here traditionally so one of the things about the zoom was it in that

303
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,600
 zoom i think this is a lot of things i'm allowed to talk about that they had kevin lampi talking

304
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,680
 to us who is a very high powered PR and he talked to us about how the we should say

305
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:11,680
 in every sentence did i mention that i was a hugo finalist i mean i am not in any way exaggerating

306
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,080
 he was on a zoom for hugo finalist and i should say at this point that i am a hugo finalist and

307
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,880
 he said in every sentence you say to anybody you should say that you are a hugo finalist and i've

308
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,640
 been trying to do though i couldn't do that but i can't i mean it was quite hard just doing it

309
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,640
 for the length of that comment my students are going to get really fed up in my lectures

310
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:41,200
 so it was by british standards i think i found that presentation a bit much i think people who have

311
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,400
 been outside the system and are for whom it's genuinely a new experience just like a bit of guidance

312
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,960
 that they're not jumping and it's something i have heard from first-time finalists previously

313
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,680
 that they would have liked a bit more advice as to how to handle it and to tell people well

314
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:06,400
 there's two there's two things here which is firstly we're old hands now but secondly none of us have

315
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,720
 any real skin in the game it's purely ego boo for us whereas like if you are an author there's like

316
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,600
 actual career considerations involved and so yeah i think having that kind of guidance i mean for

317
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,440
 us we were like well you know we might tell people we're a hugo finalist and then we might never

318
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,880
 mention it again and it's fine but i can see it for nominated for professional things yes for

319
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,040
 someone who's at the very very start of their career and i was about to say who are professionally

320
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,240
 nominated but i don't think that's a career i don't i hope that nobody was yes exactly so so

321
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:44,000
 bob shaw um who i really quite adored um had to kind of wrestle his publishers to the ground to

322
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,520
 stop them putting hugo winner on his books when he had won the hugo for best fanzine and best

323
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:56,880
 fan writer and and i'm like oh oh and but he but i think times have changed and i actually know at

324
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,680
 least one author who has who has won in a fan category and then pushed on their books now and i think

325
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,000
 probably that's something that people do more now yeah that's where we admire the modesty of

326
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,160
 peter capaldi who is in fact a winner of an Oscar but not as an actor is he what was he what did he

327
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,080
 win for he won best animated film quite already in his career he did an animation film about

328
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,240
 france kafka oh i i wrote this is slightly off topic but the it's called google it for her job

329
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,520
 google it for me it's funny but i went to the the name of the film soaf says in discord if you or

330
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,520
 anyone you know has been affected by a hugo award nomination there is support available

331
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:44,240
 and i thought that was very good fair hello so dc says it's france kafka's it's a wonderful

332
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,240
 life that's thron yep thank you dc they there was a um the guardian had a profile of peter

333
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,960
 capaldi you can take all that other stuff out jolly the lightly edit um the guardian had a

334
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:02,480
 profile of france kafka where of god the guardian had a profile of peter capaldi in which this is

335
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,840
 going to tell us what was in it or indeed alice so i would have been alice in this

336
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:15,680
 show which is not this the guardian had a profile of peter capaldi when it mentioned his short film

337
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:22,000
 france kafka's it's a wonderful life but it put the link and the quotes around it's a wonderful life

338
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,600
 and not around france kafka's it's a wonderful life so so i wrote to the guardian's corrections

339
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:34,080
 editor as i do every about twice a week and said you have made this trivial error but it made me

340
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,360
 laugh which once like that do because they they apparently doesn't make you laugh those things

341
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:47,360
 so there are occasional times when alice says things on the podcast and there is

342
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,880
 silence and this is but you're not laughing i mean it's like what so i'm not i'm not saying

343
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,400
 i self-promote but i think i may be funnier in my head than i actually

344
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:05,280
 yeah um that was better inside my head before it came out yeah so what we thought of the easter

345
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:16,960
 con what did we think about the easter con yay i thought it was good yep and that was the easter

346
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,920
 con time for pics no come on so so i this was my easter con where i wasn't going to do anything

347
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,520
 i was just going to have a really relaxing weekend i said i'd do a newsletter shift and i'd do a bit

348
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,840
 of work on the fanfums and at four fifteen yesterday afternoon i sat down with karry and

349
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:40,320
 karry sparing and alia de verdard and had a and realized that for the next 38 minutes i had nowhere

350
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,480
 to go nothing to do nothing i felt i should have done but happened and then and then normal

351
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,040
 reality kicked in since i've been back to the too many things through a lot of life i

352
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,920
 have you been busy i i had a lot of fun um as has been mentioned we did the

353
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,840
 Hugo announcement on friday immediately after the opening ceremony and i'd been we had decided we

354
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,120
 were going to do it on that day three years ago so it was the culmination of a three-year plan

355
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,880
 to which many many people contributed um so that was big um and i'm afraid i spent

356
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,040
 saturday kind of decompressing um but uh i've been to i've been on a couple of panels i've been to a

357
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,640
 bunch more i've had huge fun in the jitters room expensively but there we are um also one thing i

358
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,920
 think i've spoken to more new people who have not been to an easter con before here than has been the

359
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,480
 case previously and i don't know whether it's because there genuinely are more new people or maybe

360
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:49,760
 it's such i just look more friendly since i grew a beard i wonder because for those those who don't

361
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,080
 know this is a smaller easter con than usual which is which is often the case in a year with the

362
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,080
 uk world con because world cons are expensive easter cons are expensive a lot of people will choose

363
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,120
 the world con over the easter con but i wonder at conventions where there are fewer fans it's easier

364
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,920
 to meet the new fans because you can just see more people as a percentage of the convention because

365
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,960
 i have met more people this year than i have since the pandemic i think and it's been really fun i had

366
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,280
 lots of lovely conversations with people i've not really talked to before and they were all great

367
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,600
 and i did not mention to any of them that i had a podcast or that it was on the Hugo Ballot

368
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,360
 because that is how i roll sorry you're supposed i understand from kevin lampy is that i'm supposed

369
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:35,200
 to put it in every sentence did you not do that um no i did not what do we think of the venue i now

370
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,320
 i'm quite shocked about this because um i was very skeptical i quite like it okay so actually i'm

371
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,400
 going to classify this i quite i think the Telford International Center is lovely it's a very good

372
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,440
 sized for an easter con we could grow quite a bit and still use it because there's another program

373
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,600
 space exactly the same size as this one so you although you'd have a little bit of walking between

374
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:03,520
 the two you could definitely you could put a huge easter con into the space and this is lovely and

375
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,520
 if it were anywhere other than Telford i do love nandos so i quite like Telford because there is a

376
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,080
 nandos there are yeah i was going to say as long as as long as your idea of a nice place to eat

377
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:25,360
 at an easter con is a low to mid-range chain restaurant that will serve you quickly like say

378
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,880
 nandos i feel like Telford is actually pretty good for that there's basically a dozen of them

379
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,640
 within about two minutes walk of the convention center and that's been quite nice

380
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,360
 if you actually want a proper meal i understand that taxi cabs are available

381
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,680
 and there's some very good places to go to in them i've been i've been to two of them i'll

382
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,760
 recommend to them the ugly duckling which is a pub on the far side of Telford and the 1840 restaurant

383
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,360
 which is a converted Methodist church about halfway to the ugly duckling fair enough so i would have

384
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,360
 thought if i were so if i had a if if everyone who has said to me this weekend that they're thinking

385
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,160
 about voting bidding for an easter con and they've got some really good ideas and if they did the

386
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,960
 easter con they would do it in a particular way that is is not the way that i have done it or that

387
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,800
 this year's done it or anything but they've got they've got strong ideas and they want to be an

388
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,920
 easter con chair if every single one of those people bids an easter con we will never be short

389
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,000
 of bids ever again we do have a question you mentioned that there are taxi cabs available

390
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,840
 and david bamford in the discord has asked can you eat taxi cabs though emily emily january says

391
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,280
 if you're not a coward and meggwitt doddle says are they deep fried so there are these are the

392
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,520
 questions we need answering so this is a Glasgow thing so is there deep fried food available in

393
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,560
 Glasgow no there's none fish and chips never made it to Scotland no no meggas promised to take me

394
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:53,600
 for deep fried pizza when i'm in Glasgow meggas never had it you did you promised steward says pizza

395
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,280
 crunch and i say pizza crunch we all say pizza crunch so um but no i'm very looking forward to

396
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,960
 Glasgow there's lots of great food in Glasgow i'm going to buy a food culture

397
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:13,280
 a few so so obviously we don't have the audience mic so i mean we do have the audience mic but i

398
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,680
 am just going to repeat for the benefit of the audience what ester just said which is that Glasgow

399
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,080
 has a vibrant food culture and i can confirm that because i i have now eaten a deep fried

400
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,320
 bar that's fair so i haven't actually i we split it between four of us which was plenty

401
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:40,480
 and there's still still too much ester came came to shout at us and ispania said she can be

402
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,680
 lured out so these are strategies and british it notes that mukvitties do do a chocolate bar called

403
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,080
 taxi so hurrah i just provided a photo that's a fair point i want to i want to quickly give my

404
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:57,280
 thoughts on the venue which is i like it um we're going to talk more about this in the next episode

405
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,080
 uh because we always do a deeper dive into the easter come when we're not being um drunk drunk

406
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,480
 tired and excitable um but what i would say and i've said this to a couple of people i've seen in

407
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,960
 the convention up to now is if you are someone who has mobility issues i would love you to write

408
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,040
 as a letter of comment before we discuss this easter con sort of very much to like to hear

409
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,720
 your thoughts on the access because there was a big conversation about that beforehand and i would

410
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,440
 like to know how people found it who attended the con so far i've heard nothing but good things

411
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,520
 but i would be interested to know whether that is accurate or representative before i shoot my

412
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,960
 mouth out on the radio i just want to say in the discord brityard branch or suggested that people

413
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,760
 are coming to talk to me because they think there may be crumbs and snacks hidden in my beard and

414
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,640
 i mean you're welcome to all come and have a good look afterwards

415
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:48,800
 well some of you are i i have been told by a secret informant who is my ex-husband

416
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,960
 that the venue has planning permission for a second lift and it just needs to find

417
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,760
 the penny stored down it's it's um you know the back of it's so far so if we bring the easter con

418
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,960
 here they might again they might find it again i'd be happy to come i think this this venue has

419
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,840
 been great really and i don't think telford's telford wasn't you know they say they're in within

420
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,600
 three hours travel of 90 percent of the uk population um and that's basically true as long as you're

421
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,160
 not trying to travel on monday thursday or by train

422
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:34,160
 picks so nicholas as our guest would you like to have a pick yeah my picks are both dr who relations

423
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:40,480
 excellent inevitably it does sound like you're on brand um it's i know it's utterly uncharacteristic

424
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,360
 one of them is just a general sequence of books about dr who stories called the black archive and

425
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,960
 what they do is every month they take a different story either from old who or from you who and

426
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,720
 they've also done screen of the chalca and the tv movie with them with with paul mcgane which

427
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:05,200
 can fall between them and they have somebody just doing an in-depth dive in a scholarly way usually

428
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:13,280
 in the space of 80 to 120 pages just looking at how the story came to be what it really means

429
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:22,000
 what what how it ties into wider cultural issues wider historical issues um i've i've read the first

430
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:30,320
 60 of the 80 or so that have been published so far and of those 16 maybe three or four have been

431
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,680
 done and that's quite a good strike rate for any series of any series of books the other one also

432
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:43,840
 dr who related um john you'll recall we had dinner in los angines um a month or so ago with yourself

433
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:51,600
 and espania and with simon garyer um a doctor who fiction writer and writer of many other things as

434
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,880
 well he's just published a biography of david twitter who was the first script editor of doctor

435
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,720
 who back in the early 1960s and wrote several of the classic stories of the heart and the

436
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,360
 and trot and eras including the two trot and dalek stories um very interesting character

437
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:17,520
 who managed to um pass through his career without leaving much of an imprint in people who knew him

438
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,040
 they're they're kind of uh people are asked about meetings that he was clearly asked because he's in

439
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,440
 the he's in the minutes and they can't remember that he was there a bit like the bob shaw character

440
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,480
 who's a human neutrino and uh nobody remembers who he was and you know poor david wittaker died in

441
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,080
 1980 at the age of 51 if he'd lived another five years he would have become one the celebrities of

442
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,560
 the burgeoning doctor who fan culture that appeared around about that time but he didn't

443
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,200
 poor guy and i got the sense that um he'd had an internal career at the bbc decided to go freelance

444
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,920
 and discovered that nobody knew who he was which is an awful shame so it's uh it's it's quite a

445
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:02,160
 thick book but i found it very interesting because he goes um simon goes into the um wider tv culture

446
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:09,040
 and theatrical culture and general um issues with how british society functions at the time

447
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,800
 so i strongly recommend that i have discovered recently that i bloody love history books

448
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,280
 especially very specific nerdy history books so that sounds very good this is this is pretty

449
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,640
 specific and pretty nerdy yeah yeah it sounds very very good i might have to look that up like that

450
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,480
 one on the space program yeah that was great and it was very helpful in my uh panel on saturday

451
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,360
 which feared much more into the geopolitics of space than i think i was expecting it to so i was

452
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,760
 very glad i had interesting things to say about that so dc makes the abstit of the accurate point that

453
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,520
 david which was omitted from the drama documentary and adventure in space and time his role was actually

454
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,280
 merged with several other characters so yeah abstit absolutely fair point allison do you have a pick

455
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,920
 um i was wondering if you wanted to go first actually i do have a pick i'm going to pick something

456
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,240
 on the bleeding edge of culture which is a six episode television series from 2004 and it is

457
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:12,160
 garth meringue's dark place oh tell us about your cosplay john so yes um on on saturday uh

458
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,040
 ispania and i cosplayed characters from garth meringue's dark place i was uh dr rick daggles md

459
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:27,040
 um ispania was maddling wool uh who plays liz asher in the show so this is a um tv show where the

460
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:33,280
 conceit is quite dr who e in the the conceit is it was so horrific at the time it was made that it was

461
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,800
 banned on british television and it wasn't shown anywhere in the world except for prue

462
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,200
 and um they found it in a cupboard and decided to rebroadcast it on channel four with talking heads

463
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,560
 and like historical commentary from the cast but it's actually a pistiche and it's um it's

464
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,000
 matt wholeness it's rich die oardie it's matt berry and allislow and it also has like other luminaries of

465
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,840
 the british comedy scene from the time so it's got like the mighty bush in it it's got several people

466
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:03,040
 who who went on to do much bigger things later and yeah it's just great so it's on i believe it's

467
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,920
 on catch up on the channel for website it will take you maybe three hours to watch the whole thing

468
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,240
 it is absolutely hilarious and i would highly commend it to anyone uh who likes comedy horror

469
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:20,480
 or slow motion i'm very much hoping that someone who took a picture of jon and ispania on saturday

470
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,520
 can drop it into the discord chat now so that so that jt can stick it up on the big screen so

471
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:33,040
 you can see how lovely their costumes were my pick so very unusually for me i'm going to pick

472
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,200
 something i haven't actually watched yet which is the easter con 2024 catch up program

473
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:48,480
 yeah so so i am planning to spend the next week or so um attending the convention virtually in a

474
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,040
 way that i couldn't this week on account of how i was in the newsletter room and all the fanfans

475
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,040
 table and and working and also in the bar frankly there's a certain amount of drinking went on

476
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,400
 it's hard to mention i know um but i believe that there are many many many good things and what

477
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,800
 you need you to all to do is is message me or in fact put in the discord your picks for what

478
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,080
 things i should prioritize whilst whilst picking up catch up over the next week i thought i might

479
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,000
 spend the whole of next weekend just attending the easter con because i never actually have time to

480
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,480
 go to it i mean i did go to some program items this weekend but i was on them i attended a very

481
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,080
 good program item i would recommend for catch up which was uh stew hotson gave a talk on Saturday

482
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:37,920
 night about um whiteness in gaming and about how we can try and make gaming uh more accessible and

483
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,920
 less repellent is a really strong word but less off-putting for people who are not white and i found

484
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,040
 it absolutely fascinating and i would i would extremely highly commend it to anyone who is looking

485
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,680
 for an interesting talk and the other one i recommend is esta mccollum stewart who gave a great

486
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,440
 talk on the history of games and its intersection with dr hoo and it had lots of pictures of chutie

487
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:07,200
 gatwa in it and he's very pretty yes esta is waving from behind her for chair fort are we going to take

488
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,640
 any questions from the audience do we have time jt you've got 30 so all right first person to have

489
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,720
 a hand up gets to ask a question there kev don't kill yourself jt we need you just following on the

490
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:26,160
 discussion i wonder if we should rename glasco 2020 for a deep fried world con oh esta will

491
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,960
 esta will stab you and now we're running away but i think i think that was a comment not a question

492
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,560
 kev quite funny though esta says that there is a vibrant food culture i mean i think i'm prepared

493
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:45,120
 to say without shadow of a doubt that glasco will have better food best to tell but no glasco when i

494
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:50,960
 went to we went to um satellite the last satellite convention and uh the food was the highlight of

495
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,960
 the convention for me so i'm very much looking forward to going to Glasgow and having lots of

496
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,080
 extremely good food i mean glasco is actually a world quality city in many respects i mean

497
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,360
 can i just can i have a show of hands how many people i i did this exact same joke last night

498
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,720
 in the fanfans auction so i'm sorry guys how many people are intending to attend glasco 2024

499
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
 weeee

500
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:19,120
 it is noted from the audience that esta did not put her hand up how many people in the audience are

501
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:25,680
 not intending to attend glasco 2024 okay right esta nail hunt them down

502
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:36,800
 she emerges have you got your membership documentation ready this is very good but seriously guys i mean

503
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,400
 not not so much now but you're probably for the people who are listening to this on the pod i

504
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,720
 mean i think it's going to be a brilliant worldcon i think if you like eastercons and you like

505
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,640
 wilcons when they're kind of doing it right and you like glasco which has a vibrant food culture i

506
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:02,080
 understand but glasco is a brilliant world city and and eastercons in glasco are great and

507
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,600
 wilcon in glasco is going to be great it will be amazing we will be having an octave meetup of some

508
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,640
 description i think i think it's fair to say we have asked glasco if we could have an octave

509
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,080
 thought live session at one o'clock on the monday i mean we will have we will definitely i think

510
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,040
 unless glasco secretly hate us which we can't rule out i think i think there will be a live

511
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,920
 episode of octave octave act glasco but um but yes it will hopefully be good would be good if it was

512
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,280
 one o'clock on monday so that we can so that we can talk about the con sorry if we didn't as far
