 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 78th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,920
 and science fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 2nd of March 2023. I'm John Coxon,

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,520
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. And we have some letters of comment. We do. We have a letter of

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:38,320
 comment from Andge who says that they got a bit far behind on episodes of Octa Thorpe and then they

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,960
 just started listening from a recent one instead of trying to listen to the backlog. Hello, welcome

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,120
 back. Hi Andge. Hi Andge. Hello Andge. We also got a letter of comment from Dave Coxon who talked

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,120
 about our picks for dramatic presentation short form, said that he's late to the party on The Boys

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,880
 and he's just about to finish season two but he's loving it for all the reasons I talk about and

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,680
 more and then he also says he's about to sign up to Apple TV plus again primarily to watch

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,200
 Severance because of our summary and recommendation. I hope you enjoy Severance Dave is pre-great.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,240
 Come Severance stick around for Ted Lasso season three. Yes. On a J. Ted Lasso.

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:29,760
 Where's your wrong head? Yes. And we also heard from Chris Dafodj Garcia. He refuses to read the

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:37,040
 show notes to which I say boo. They're all beautiful bullet points Chris read the show notes read them

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,280
 read them now read them and then he also says he bounced off severance but that's likely because

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,000
 he was watching it on his phone and I'm like yeah maybe maybe I do think Severance is a show

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,280
 that creates an atmosphere and I do wonder whether if you're watching it on your phone with two

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,040
 kids running around also listening to the wrestling that atmosphere is harder to create but that might

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,920
 just be me. He does also give us some recommendations for short films bouncing off our discussion of the

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,440
 best dramatic presentation short form. Unfortunately I haven't seen any of them. I'll track down and

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,880
 see if they're on YouTube or anywhere that you can see and put them in the show notes because I

22
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,160
 think these are all short films rather than episodes of TV and that's somewhere where I'm very under

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,840
 under researched. Yes well Chris so we have Chris is very good at short films but also Chris

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
 doesn't read the show notes so Chris we've put all those recommendations in the show notes.

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,240
 So what I love about Chris's lock is that there are two sentences which we're going to need

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,600
 clarification on. The first sentence is or the first sorry the first paragraph is the 80s were

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,800
 the proper time for RPG systems. I've only once run that was the end of the paragraph.

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,320
 There was no full stop. Chris what have you only once run and then that big spreadsheet has been

29
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,240
 incredibly useful. Largely because I forget the months from January through to about October.

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,040
 I will say that the single best thing I watched last year was

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,120
 and then that's the end of that paragraph. So Chris write in and tell us what you ran and what the

32
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,600
 single best thing you watched last year was because I think you might have been more distracted than

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,840
 usual on this lock. I am wondering if Chris might dictate his letters of comment to us and the

34
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,680
 reason I'm wondering this is that I got back from the from a birthday party very late last night

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
 very drunk. I'd had a fantastic tube journey home and I thought I must write this down my

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,400
 assumed journey was amazing. It was everything that is great about the London Underground and I

37
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
 have to write it down and I realized I was incapable of writing so I have dictated it.

38
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:46,400
 So I have like 3000 words of late night dictated text that I have to go back to and see if it

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,360
 makes any sense at all. I'm not sure strictly speaking the problem here was that you dictated it.

40
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:01,840
 Yeah I was the phrase "a poor workman blames their tools". We also heard from Rave who said that

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
 they're glad the Clark Awards exists but they tend not to use it as a recommendation engine as it

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,280
 tends to skew more literally than they tend to enjoy and they would definitely have nominated

43
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,480
 time and again which is the Ms Marvel time travel episode for BDPSF. I might still like I'm

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,160
 I'm dithering. I'm dithering Raj and then he's definitely with me on Spock amok he loved

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,160
 Strangely Worlds and that episode was just brilliant which yes good I'm glad you think so Raj.

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,720
 Raj also messaged me personally on Maston to express delight that I had not seen ghosts and

47
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,600
 tell me I should watch it more. So many many people on Anonymous Square stopped

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,080
 stopped listening to the podcast in astonishment at the point where they discover that John hadn't

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,080
 watched ghosts and said John you're one of the lucky 10 000. So yeah today's lucky 10 000.

50
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,640
 So have you watched any of it yet? Nope. There you go. Well we've been watching

51
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
 we've been watching other things. Yeah it's fine but you can save it up for some time when you

52
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,920
 want to fail you know lightweight treat it's not it's not gonna it's not gonna change your life

53
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,800
 it's just gonna make you laugh I hope you'll watch it now going oh this is the most unfunny

54
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,960
 thing ever what were these people talking about?

55
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:28,080
 Chengdu our regular Chengdu segment so Chengdu sent some emails to members

56
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,800
 sent several emails to members some of them BCC'd only to me some of them just sent to me

57
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,640
 and about 15 other random people some of them which in my inbox some of them in my spam folder

58
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,400
 I'm not gonna blame them too hard. That is yeah that I can't let you can blame them for and to

59
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,960
 refer the second email did not end up in my spam filter and I'm using Google mail so they probably

60
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,960
 worked out how to keep it out of the Google ones. I do think it was a bit naughty just sticking

61
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,920
 email addresses in the two line because I now have 15 random people email addresses who are

62
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,880
 presuming members of Chengdu. I feel like Worldcon should be a bit better than this but then I don't

63
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,800
 know if I was trying to use WeChat mail or something I'd probably make similar errors.

64
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 It was CC'd only to 10 people rather than to like the entire Worldcon membership because that

65
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,000
 would have been quite funny and then when people started messaging back on reply all saying please

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,520
 take me off this list. Yeah that is true they didn't send it to 7,000 people whatever they did just

67
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,560
 send it obviously doing it in batches and I mean I hope no one was doing it by hand but I

68
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,040
 wonder if that's what they were doing and that's why. Oh they were 100% they were 100% doing it by

69
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:48,400
 handle list you know it to be true. What the email actually said was that the 2023 Hugo Awards

70
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,320
 nomination page is in final testing expected open by the end of the month and then they will email

71
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,720
 as all and there will be a paper ballot as well nominations will run until the end of April 2023

72
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,760
 voting begins in May 2023 and will last till August 2023 so it's it's a you know perfectly straight

73
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,800
 forward email it's got all the timings in you might want to give you the website it is in two

74
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,440
 languages it's pretty good. Yes that does mean listeners that as you're listening to this the end

75
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,080
 of the month has come and gone we are recording before the end of the month but you're listening to

76
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,200
 it after is it time travel maybe but this might mean it's open now it also might mean it isn't

77
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,920
 which is technically always true but is more likely to be notable this time.

78
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,600
 By the way you've got two months to do the nominating so probably all right.

79
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,560
 Exactly no this is very good and they also released PR1 and successfully sent me an email

80
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,920
 about PR1 which was not CC 20 of the people so I think they've you know got the hang of that now.

81
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,040
 Yes it's very exciting who read PR1 very briefly.

82
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,400
 I read PR1. I did not so what have you can talk about it.

83
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,560
 It's it's a very nice PR1 it's got all the stuff you would expect in PR1 in that it's got you know

84
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,160
 some quite vague stuff about like generally getting to Chengdu what hotels they've got some

85
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
 bits about the you know tourism activities you can do there's bits about the food about what

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,280
 will be going on it is a perfectly fine PR1 it's just that normally PR1 would have been out like

87
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,680
 about 10 minutes after you won the vote. No actually that's not true PR0 comes out then

88
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,880
 but I mean we've just got PR1 for Glasgow so you can see they're basically running about a year

89
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,440
 behind and I think the level of detail is about what I would want you know a year and a half before

90
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,280
 the convention. Hmm okay that's fair it is very beautiful and I think given how difficult travel

91
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,280
 arrangements are going to be for anyone outside China I feel like I would like them to start

92
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,640
 easing into how are you going to get there where are you going to stay what are the practicalities

93
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,200
 like though I mean obviously we're grown up so we can work it out for ourselves but I felt a lot

94
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,880
 of that was missing I also noticed the recommitment to their guests of honor so this is the official

95
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,480
 point every octa thought that we talk about Chengdu where I say Serga Li Kinenko is still a badon.

96
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,720
 Confirmed Rotta absolutely I flirted very briefly with the idea of going to China on the way back

97
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,920
 from Australia but it's clearly insane and impossible I'm not going to be doing that.

98
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,800
 When you said very briefly you mean we had an extensive discussion about it on the podcast that

99
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,240
 John then had to trim out I think. But that was a very brief flirt. I've had much longer flirts

100
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,640
 than that. There are a few things in here which are interesting firstly I had not realized so in

101
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,320
 my tiny little head when someone's a co-chair it means that there are two of them and that is

102
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,000
 not the case there are three co-chairs there is he, ji, there is Chen, she and there is Beniello

103
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,480
 so I had not realized there were two Chinese co-chairs which maybe everyone else knew but I did not

104
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,640
 and then they also have the division list which is really interesting so they have you know some

105
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,320
 divisions it's interesting because what we would usually call the wasphus division is actually like

106
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,200
 three separate divisions which is kind of weird though as someone has done it that way it might

107
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,280
 be the in practice they haven't that's just the way they're reporting it but it's also interesting

108
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,000
 that the site selection division is being run by the same person as the program division I guess

109
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,200
 because program is famously not a big job so you can just do another job as well I find that a bit

110
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
 odd because I'd kind of find it reasonable if it was a business meeting that was being done by

111
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,720
 the program division person because I can kind of see how you need to do scheduling but site selection

112
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,320
 is like there's not a lot in common with program is there it's mostly it seems like maybe even

113
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,360
 exhibits would have been made anyway don't understand that very strange and a lot of these don't have

114
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,000
 American co-heads which I think we noted before but it's interesting to see and then finally this

115
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,520
 just maybe chuckle there is a page on page 35 there is China Visa application service which gives links

116
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,280
 for all of the places you can go to get your Chinese Visa to visit China and they have got links for

117
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,880
 the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Australia,

118
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,600
 New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia and they are all the same link and it's

119
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,920
 just it just made me giggle I was just like this is a very good page I like this page very much

120
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,200
 it makes no sense to me at all but in general these are nitpicks it's very nicely put together

121
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,960
 document in general other than being a little bit late is quite nice and good art and my lovely

122
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:38,320
 pictures and just yeah it is very pretty I mean I can kind of see why they've done that I suspect

123
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,040
 the visa pages because some places you know for some place if you're applying for a visa they

124
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,600
 outsource it and they outsource it to kind of different companies depending on what country you're in

125
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,280
 yeah yeah so a lot of the time you don't apply directly for a visa from the government to apply

126
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,840
 to a particular company but yeah in this case they could have said you can apply for a visa

127
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,080
 like all these countries can apply for a visa at this place and if you're not there we'll probably

128
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,040
 figure out where the one is except you can't actually apply for a visa right now can you so

129
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,920
 I can understand why they're a bit sketchy on this because I think you can't actually apply for

130
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,720
 tourist visa yet but they probably need to have something in about like okay this is how it used

131
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,800
 to work in terms of like what documentation you're going to need and what letters you need what

132
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,000
 bits of paperwork so you can start putting it together and I mean I like the pictures are lovely

133
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,880
 especially all the ones of pandas and tasty food but maybe a bit more of that in terms of divisions

134
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,280
 it's interesting because I wonder how much their internal organization is being done in English and

135
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:43,120
 how much is being done in Chinese so I wonder if they have kind of heads of divisions who are also

136
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,880
 partly able to be like the public facing ones and then internally maybe they've delegated an awful

137
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,720
 lot to internal volunteers who are not necessarily doing everything in English because I just don't

138
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,680
 know how they're doing it I'm really interested if anyone worked on the Japanese world con actually

139
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,360
 I would be interested to know how that went in terms of like what was your internal like working

140
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,680
 language did you do it by division did you do it by area you know what did you do because I'm pretty

141
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,080
 sure when I worked on the Helsinki welcome they just kind of defaulted to English for everything

142
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,080
 and that worked fine because everyone was bilingual but I don't know if that is the case for Chengdu

143
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,320
 so it would be kind of interesting to know how that's going and in some ways it's nice to have like

144
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,600
 I do like the idea of having like an art design division which is kind of responsible for making

145
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,160
 sure that you know all the divisions have access to all the kind of design elements they need to

146
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,120
 have a nice uniform look and styling to everything I kind of like that idea of having like this

147
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,280
 putting it at the high level so that everyone can say okay well we need branding for our

148
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,560
 program pages or our souvenir book or whatever and they can really be thinking about that in a

149
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,640
 joined up way this is one of the reasons why I think I've been advocating for publications and

150
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,280
 publicity to merge and become communications for a while because that should be under the purview

151
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,320
 of one of those divisions probably under publications because they'll be right in the style guide but

152
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,080
 it's not entirely clear which one should have that under their bail work which is why merging them

153
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,200
 and because it should clearly be one of them but I agree I think and basically if you read the thing

154
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,560
 I ain't quite clear that sponsorship and branding oh no because publicity they also have publicity

155
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,440
 I don't understand but yes I think you're entirely right and that ties into things we've been saying

156
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,720
 the other thing I noticed about this is that there is a there are 255 rooms on site and then

157
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,520
 all of the other hotels are a little way away and I know nothing about public transport in

158
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,280
 Chengdu but that wouldn't might have been a thing that when they were telling us about the hotels

159
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,120
 they might also have told us about well and but you've got to bear in mind that you know when

160
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,680
 ever British Random has done a split site convention it's worked flawlessly and there have been no

161
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,120
 teething issues so I'm sure this will be fine yeah and what we mean by split site for Easter

162
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,440
 cons for example is often across the road and people still have trouble with it

163
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:17,280
 let's talk about Covid oh we had a few months off and now we're back on it again

164
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,560
 it's conversation which is the Easter con that I am doing communications for has released its Covid

165
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,120
 policy and um and a day later we kind of tightened up a bit or we clarified what we meant by a

166
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,200
 couple of things because people said sure you don't mean this and we had a little conflasm we

167
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,360
 went no we don't mean this we mean that so it's there you can read it we'll put a link to the

168
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,000
 show notes I'm sure John and Liz don't have anything to say about it so we can move straight on then

169
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,280
 so I think it is worth saying that this is obviously an area where you know Alison is working

170
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,360
 on the convention and and is part of the communications for the convention and so

171
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,800
 you may know is in this segment that me and John talk more and maybe Alison talks a bit less

172
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,640
 than usual just because this is one of the first times I think it's come up that we're having a

173
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,520
 discussion on the podcast where you know one person is involved in the convention we're

174
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,280
 discussing which doesn't hasn't happened that often but it's probably likely to happen more

175
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,560
 often as we work on more conventions and certainly there's bits of discussion about maybe shy con

176
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,520
 where I had a small role where I would sort of sit on my hands and and not say things so if you're

177
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,280
 wondering why Alison is a little bit quieter than usual and me and John are a bit noisier than

178
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,760
 usual then that is why. John do you want to go first John just like your first what do you think John

179
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:36,480
 or don't need to start yeah you start you're better at starting than me um I think on this one

180
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,880
 I'm I think on this one I'm more in the middle ground than John I don't think it's a very good policy

181
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,640
 basically so it's quite a long covid policy um when you compare it to things like maybe Boscon's

182
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,520
 covid policy which is much shorter more straightforward it is quite long and I think that's also you

183
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,560
 know it's always harder to get people to read and follow and understand the long set of rules but

184
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,600
 I just think it kind of undercuts itself quite a lot so I'll say at the start it says it has been

185
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,400
 possible for thousands to assemble at conventions like Dragon Meat, Game Expo and Fancy Con without

186
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,040
 finding themselves at undue risk but it doesn't actually go on to tell me anything about why they

187
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,760
 think those conventions in particular were good at not putting people at undue risk from covid because

188
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,640
 I have no idea who at Dragon Meat or Fantasy Con got covid and I don't know if anyone was tracking

189
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,080
 that or if anyone really knows so I think without a bit more detail on why they think it is possible

190
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,760
 for people to assemble in specialist conference facilities it doesn't really reassure me very

191
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,480
 much and then I would also say it kind of undercuts itself a bit which by saying things like

192
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,080
 conversation 2023 recommends that you follow national guidelines in respect to vaccination

193
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,240
 fine but then says we will not ask about vaccination status so vaccination is important but we won't

194
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,360
 ask you to tell us your vaccination status or prove it it says please take a lateral flow test

195
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,560
 before leaving home but then just says we will not ask you to show us your test results so it's

196
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,400
 important to test but we won't ever check you did it because we don't care about them it just sort of

197
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,280
 it's a bit overly complicated I just think you could do a much kind of simpler and more straightforward

198
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,080
 one that might be easier to enforce and there's a few other ones basically saying we you know we

199
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,640
 encourage members to mask but then saying we won't enforce it anywhere and you have to respect everyone's

200
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,680
 choices on it fine just sort of like goes back and forth a bit I think they have clarified the

201
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,640
 one about the program one originally said I think that panelists wouldn't be allowed to wear masks

202
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,560
 it just now says they're encouraged not to wear masks but then it says you encourage to wear a

203
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,480
 mask while attending program items but some items are explicitly tagged as masked optional and you

204
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,480
 will not be asked to wear a mask so the other ones are implicitly masks required except they're also

205
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,280
 masks optional and then it says that moderators may ask audiences to space themselves and wear

206
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,680
 masks if rooms are crowded and if I was a moderator I would really hate being put in the position where

207
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,440
 I was having to enforce a covid policy especially one that is kind of as back and forth as this one

208
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,280
 so I think even without discussion of like where this sits on my personal spectrum of

209
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,760
 feeling safe about covid and attending conventions and the time of covid I just feel it gives quite

210
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,560
 a lot of mixed messages and I'm not really clear of whether the convention is really yes we should

211
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,320
 wear masks but you know please respect there are a few people who can't wear masks and don't question

212
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,320
 them about it or whether like we should wear masks but actually it's okay if you don't wear masks

213
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,880
 but sometimes we'll ask you to wear masks but there are masks optional program items it just

214
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,680
 doesn't feel like a very satisfactory covid policy to me that was my monologue I don't think there's

215
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,360
 much to add to what you said actually Liz this might end up being a very short segment yeah that

216
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,240
 basically neatly encapsulates everything I think I think so one of the things I said when the

217
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,120
 policy came out in discussions on anonymous Claire if you're not an anonymous Claire let us know and

218
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,960
 we'll invite you to that discord was that I found it odd that if I was a panelist on panels that

219
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,880
 wanted to mask the original covid policy very much made me feel like the convention didn't want

220
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,760
 me to do that and I think that has since been clarified which is good and they were good at the

221
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,520
 at the previous east con you had to mask if you were an attendee unless you had a medical reason

222
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,760
 not to but panelists were asked not to mask and I was happy with that because it felt like a good

223
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,400
 mixture between accessibility and risk but this convention the masking on the part of the

224
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,880
 participant seems like it will it will probably be less good just because of the difference in the

225
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,400
 policies and so I I think if I am going to be on panels I will probably want to mask for that reason

226
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,920
 so I was happy that it was clarified that that was something I could do I do think in general I sort

227
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,960
 of wish that all of the things about whether or not these things would be enforced just hadn't been

228
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,080
 set out loud because I think a policy where it's like we expect you to mask and then the internal

229
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,240
 policy is but we're not going to actually like enforce it very well is probably better than saying

230
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,920
 our large you're not going to enforce it very well because it makes you feel much more optional

231
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,760
 than maybe the convention committee would like it to be I think there are a couple of bits where

232
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,560
 I understand why it ended up that way but it doesn't I feel like it will result in less

233
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,400
 masking and less testing and less people who have vaccinated which obviously as as long-time listeners

234
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
 to the podcast will know makes me a little bit uncomfortable so the other thing I would say is

235
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:16,320
 a aside from my kind of disagreements with how the policy is worded is it it is a bit weaker than

236
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,920
 we've seen at previous Eastercons well I guess reclamation is the only one we've fully had in the

237
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,680
 covid what covid era but it's weaker than other conventions and what I would say is it's weaker

238
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,560
 and I'm not really sure why because I think you know last year it was you must show proof of vaccination

239
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,920
 or proof that you're exempt from vaccination and as far as I can tell and I wasn't on the convention

240
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,400
 committee so there may have been things I missed that didn't seem to be a massive barrier so unless

241
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,760
 there were lots of people who were excluding because they couldn't get vaccinated and couldn't show

242
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,160
 proof of not being able to get vaccinated I'm not really sure why we just didn't keep that and for

243
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,000
 example I think you could have a very simple policy which was you must be masked when you are

244
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,720
 watching program items in program rooms unless you are either on a mask optional item or you have

245
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,640
 arranged a special lanyard to show that you don't have to mask which I know a few people had at the

246
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,000
 previous Eastercons but not so many that it made me feel like there was a massive unmasked segment

247
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,920
 of the audience and then if you've got that in place then I feel a lot happy about saying well

248
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,320
 maybe we can have the five participants sitting quite far away who don't have to wear masks

249
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,120
 and if the expectation is that you're wearing them in certain areas e.g. the program room and

250
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,160
 you know there's a mast only social land which conversation said they'll have then that just

251
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,720
 seems a lot easier for like expectations you can expect that if you go in a program room people

252
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,640
 will be masked you expect if you go in the bar people will not be masked and it also just seems

253
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,200
 like that would be more straightforward and a lot easier to enforce and then moderators can just say

254
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,040
 they can just remind people that the policy is that in program you should be masked without it being

255
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,440
 them having to make the choice to tell people they have to mask maybe without the convention

256
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,280
 feeling like the convention is backing them up on that and I also think you could then write the

257
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,800
 policy in half the space and you've more chance people reading it so it feels a bit to me like

258
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:10,160
 this is a policy that is trying to cover all its all its bases and I do accept that you know

259
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,040
 science fiction inventions by requiring masking at all are now falling quite far on the end of the

260
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:21,680
 spectrum of covid prevention and covid precautions and I can see that you know we're at the point where

261
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,040
 there's no realistic time in sight when we can drop these precautions you know essentially what

262
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,680
 we're putting in place now might be what we have to keep in place for conventions for at least the

263
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:37,280
 next few years but I think this one is falling a bit too far on the side of giving people lots of

264
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,080
 options and the result will probably be most people are not masked and then that might mean that there

265
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,000
 are people who don't attend because they don't feel they will be able to sit in program or they

266
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,720
 don't feel that they'll be able to you know walk around conventions bases and decide not to attend

267
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,520
 I know that conversation said there will be a hybrid convention but I don't actually know what

268
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,920
 their hybrid provision is going to be there is a bit in the most recent newsletter saying you know

269
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,840
 they're gonna they're gonna stream things but we don't have a huge amount of kind of concrete

270
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,920
 information on that and I feel if they were telling me more to get me excited about the virtual

271
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,240
 aspects then that might go alongside you know if there are a few people who say well I can't attend

272
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,720
 unless the whole convention is masked which we know is impractical because there will be people

273
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,360
 not from the convention in the hotel and the hotel staff and so we know you know we are never going

274
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,600
 to be able to have a space where every single person is masked and if that is a barrier to people

275
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,080
 then give them something to be excited about on the virtual side and at the moment conversation is

276
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,800
 not giving me enough concrete stuff about the virtual side to make me feel excited about it

277
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:43,120
 yeah I do think in hindsight having the covid policy go live at the same time as a lot of news

278
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,320
 about the hybrid elements of the convention would have probably been a good idea well firstly

279
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,920
 if everyone's discussing the hybrid convention fewer people will be annoyed about the covid policy

280
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,240
 so just from a convention self-serving perspective I think that would have been good but I think

281
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:07,360
 also what you said Liz I am annoyed by how like philosophically in the UK like I catch the

282
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 Metro and there are people like sneezing and coughing and wiping their noses and they're not

283
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,680
 masked and it's like I feel like we had a real chance to adopt a culture where you cared about

284
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,920
 not getting other people sick and I feel like that ship has sailed and I'm very distressed that

285
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,280
 the wider British public have not decided to move in that direction it's just really annoying when

286
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,320
 you see someone who's clearly ill on that trope and they're not masking and it's like well I don't

287
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,000
 want your cold like sod off and one of the things I like about science fiction fandom philosophically

288
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,560
 is that historically it's always felt like a space to me where we are one of the first groups

289
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:47,680
 to adopt changes that make things better for those who are less enfranchised like science fiction

290
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,240
 conventions were among the first events to adopt code of conduct policies science fiction conventions

291
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,800
 brought in stuff like panel parity whereas like academic conferences still really haven't done

292
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:02,480
 that and like it does annoy me because although I don't necessarily expect better from the general

293
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,160
 public I think I did expect better from science fiction fandom and that makes me a bit sad which

294
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,920
 is a very philosophical point but I think it's an inescapable one okay so I thought that was all

295
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,960
 very kind of fair and to not kind of weigh off at one end I think the policy does reflect a range

296
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,680
 of views we think it reflects it clearly reflects a raise of views in the committee but it also

297
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,200
 reflects some of the range of views that we've been told by our members and by staff so we we have

298
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,680
 been canvassing for views so we knew that we had really everything from everyone should be

299
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:45,040
 masked at all times no exceptions you know all the way to nobody should be asked to be masked here

300
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:51,280
 in 2023 because covid has gone away covid has not gone away I think it reflects the fact that there's

301
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,040
 going to be a lot of people at this convention who are not subject to the policy not just hotel

302
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,920
 staff but also other people in the hotel they'll be moving through convention spaces if you're

303
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,400
 trying to be in an environment where there aren't unmasked people this isn't the right environment

304
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,520
 because there are going to be a lot of unmasked people in the convention hotel and and quite a

305
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,880
 lot of unmasked people in the convention space so including you know hotel staff and and people

306
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,240
 moving through our space to get to other spaces in the hotel people can and and should reduce their

307
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:29,200
 own risk dramatically by having a having an ff2 ffp2 or fp3 masks and properly wearing it and if

308
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,600
 they're worried about risk they should use it consistently including when socializing so one of

309
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,400
 things that happened last year is that almost nobody at easter con wore their mask when socializing

310
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,080
 and most people at easter con socialized quite a lot so I think that was one of the things that

311
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,280
 that caused some people to say well actually you're taking no effective precautions anyway

312
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,200
 ignoring the fact there were a portion of the membership who were being extremely careful

313
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,520
 people who want to be extremely careful should carry on being extremely careful and they will

314
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,320
 reduce their risk very substantial we're trusting our members to be responsible grownups and making

315
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,640
 responsible decisions we are saying don't come with symptoms and if anyone's obviously ill I think

316
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,000
 that we've told you not to come to the convention and to leave the convention and isolate you will

317
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,240
 be able to watch almost all of the convention online so you know that's a major point and you

318
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,960
 can do it to the hotel room though though my my tech bunnies will say please if you have got 5g

319
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,640
 watch the convention on your 5g rather than using the hotel Wi-Fi because we are slightly

320
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,480
 worried that if if lots of people are watching the convention from the hotel room we won't have

321
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,760
 the Wi-Fi for it but you know we're not going to change it now so it's probably not perfect I'm

322
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,640
 sure it could be better but you know unless there's a major change in the covid situation

323
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,760
 before Easter we're not expecting to change the policy we are expecting airflow to do quite a lot

324
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,560
 of the heavy lifting for us we have over twice as much convention space as reclamation had last

325
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:07,040
 year and the hiltons are much more modern and better laid out hotel generally in terms of space

326
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:13,200
 and airflow and has recently upgraded all of its filters so we think it's going to be a lot better

327
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,400
 and we think airflow does is a lot of what you want here I've said to everyone bring a sweater

328
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,040
 because we'll leave doors open wherever we possibly can and and we are giving great funds if you if

329
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,480
 as a result of this policy you don't think you can attend the convention we will refund your money

330
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,800
 just get in touch but before you ask for a refund do consider whether you might enjoy the

331
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,000
 convention online where you have no risk of getting covid any more than all of the rest of the time

332
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,240
 in your life is that fair enough I I just I just want to push back a little bit on the idea that I

333
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,840
 can take personal responsibility for my own risk by wearing a well-fitting mask because I think

334
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,200
 you're then pushing the responsibility back on individuals for what is kind of a collective problem

335
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,560
 like yes I could wear a well-fitting mask at all times but what would really help me not get covid

336
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,400
 is if other people who have covid also wear a well-fitting mask and that I can't do anything

337
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,800
 about and I think it's also you know you can say oh well people were socializing without masks on

338
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,440
 but actually when I think back to my Easter con last year I socialized with the same group of

339
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,160
 people consistently with masks off but then when I was in program I sat with lots of other people

340
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,920
 and kept masks on and they were mostly keeping masks on so I don't think I think we kind of get

341
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,600
 this kind of all or nothing oh well if you're going to the bar with that mask on then there's no

342
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,160
 point wearing a mask any other time and I'm not sure that is entirely true and also we're saying a

343
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,080
 lot of things about airflow and filtering but we've we've all become like armchair experts on airflow

344
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,400
 and filtering now but there are kind of specifications for this kind of thing and what kind of filters

345
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,600
 you have and what the air turnover is in your spaces and things like that and I think if you had

346
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,640
 a bit more detail on that people might be able to be a bit more reassured because you know you

347
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,200
 you can say it's got more modern filtering than the previous hotel but what I don't know is whether

348
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,760
 you can say and also other conventions which have used this space have had masking policies and had

349
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,360
 no case of covid or things like that or you can point to why this one is particularly good and

350
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,200
 better I want to say two things I think there is a there is a lack of understanding of probability

351
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,120
 distributions among the people having this discussion because if you wear a mask the center of your

352
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,480
 probability distribution goes towards lower risk and what that means is that over the course of

353
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,360
 a convention every time you wear a mask instead of not wearing a mask you are at lower risk and

354
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,880
 so your integrated risk is lower as even if you go to a four-day convention and only wear a mask

355
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,680
 for one program item your integrated risk will be lower than if you had not done that and so if

356
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,960
 even if you're in the bar unmasked for a little bit you are still much safer masking the rest of the

357
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,800
 time and I think people are forgetting that it isn't a binary you get covid or you don't I mean

358
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,160
 obviously it is at the end but what it is is it's a risk profile and risk profiles are percentages

359
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,640
 not yes no so I do think that's important maths I think I would say that and this is me not the

360
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,800
 convention if you attend a science fiction convention where 800 people spend the weekend in a hotel you

361
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,680
 are pushing your risk profile way over to the right at that point yes but every time you wear a mask

362
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,680
 you're moving it back to the left I will also say I wore a mask most of the time I was socialising

363
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,760
 at least calling it other than when I was actively drinking and the reason I remember that is because

364
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,280
 one friend did comment on it while I was in the bar and I'm not saying that that friend's name

365
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,680
 rhymed with schmallison mott but I'm not saying it didn't either but um but basically I mean we

366
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,160
 decided at the last east con that we would probably be going to bed at midnight at the next east

367
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:44,800
 con because it is also true the mask discipline drops substantially after about 11 p.m. midnight

368
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,680
 which is basically where everyone is too drunk to make good decisions which um you know there's

369
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:56,480
 probably I mean 100% but I would also like to say and I think this kind of gets to data I'd love

370
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,840
 I think it would be a lot easier to have some of these conversations if we had like data which is

371
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,960
 like you said you canvas members but I'd love to know like what the percentages are and like what

372
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,520
 the sample size was no we didn't do it like that we just asked people what they thought yeah that's

373
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,440
 the thing right yeah but where did you ask people what they thought and who did you ask and how did

374
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,760
 you like get those people but also one of the things about asking people is that we know that when

375
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,840
 we ask people we've got the same half dozen people who are commenting at length every time and we

376
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,600
 are not going to make those people happy no you're not but if you did a survey and canvas properly

377
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,320
 you could make the argument that it's those six dozen people is the half a dozen people think this

378
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,920
 but like 85% of the convention disagree with them or it might turn out that 85% of the people

379
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,920
 basically agree with them just are nowhere near as arseholely about it and that's the thing I'd

380
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:56,640
 love to know I'd love to know what percentage of british fandom wants there to be a mask mandate

381
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,200
 and what doesn't because if it turns out that I'm in the five percent of wanting one and 95%

382
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,400
 of people don't I mean you know I mean I'd be annoyed the same way I'm annoyed about Brexit but

383
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,640
 there's nothing I could do about it so I'd get on with things yeah I'm a bit worried that if we

384
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:17,360
 actually said should we just abandon the mask policy we get some score of like 4852 and plunge

385
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,880
 all fandom into war that's when it gets that's when it gets tricky I mean I think at some point

386
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,760
 we're going to move to not having a mask mandate and so there's there's this question about how slowly

387
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:35,280
 well yeah at some point we are going to do that and that point is in Easter we don't have a mask

388
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
 mandate so yes obviously at some point we won't have a mask mandate because we don't have a mask

389
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,080
 mandate as easy to say these things where they've already happened we are encouraging masking let's

390
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,920
 I want to be completely clear we're encouraging a range of behaviors including testing avoiding

391
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:56,800
 the convention if you're sick even if your test shows negative wearing masks whenever you might be

392
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,080
 in close proximity with other people and there's a fourth thing and vaccination yeah you know

393
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,000
 vaccination I didn't mention earlier but one of the reasons for not saying we'll check your

394
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,160
 vaccination state it is that that is one of the things where national guidelines are very clear

395
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,400
 they're very clear that you should not be doing it to the extent that they've basically said

396
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,760
 oh we only issue covid passes now for people traveling abroad because events shouldn't be doing

397
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,400
 this so so we want you to be vaccinated we think everyone should be vaccinated it's quite hard to

398
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,600
 get vaccinations now you can't get boosters now if you don't have them already gonna add a couple

399
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,600
 of things which is to john's point on the survey fandom is not a democracy and I don't know how many

400
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,360
 like policies that we think are good policies and that we accept now like things like code of conduct

401
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,480
 how many of them would have generally been you know approved by a majority of the of the fans

402
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,800
 no that's that yeah that's a good and the other thing I would say is if you were canvassing opinions

403
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,960
 from your members you will have missed out on a segment of people which is the people who aren't

404
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,800
 joining your convention until you publish your covid policy because you said you you canvas

405
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,120
 people on the covid policy and it would be we're not going to get too deep into weeds on this but

406
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,440
 there is like a group of people you're going to miss the opinions of some groups of people

407
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,400
 however you do it yeah canvas must have been too strong a word really and to go back to your point

408
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,200
 about codes of conduct list I do completely see what you mean but I do think there is an element

409
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,160
 here where it's just real tricky right I don't know whether I think it should be democratic or not

410
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,520
 I made the point earlier about like wanting sci-fi fandom to do right by the less infantrized and I

411
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,000
 do want that be equally I don't want to be a guy who keeps bloviating about an argument years after

412
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,960
 he's lost it because I also strongly feel we should be in the EU but that's why I use Brexit as an

413
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,840
 example I Brexit is something I feel very very strongly about but equally I have lost the argument

414
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,320
 and like at some point I am going to have to be okay with that for my own mental health as much

415
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,120
 for anything else

416
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,840
 can we do pics yeah I suppose so my pick is pretty sure are you doing you're not doing you've changed

417
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,240
 your pick right so it's not 17 different things oh yeah no I'm not doing that all right right

418
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:18,560
 right should I go first yes okay yes my pick is living with ghosts by carrie sparing which is a

419
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,840
 great book carrie sparing is one of the east con guests of honor I am trying to read at least one

420
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,680
 book by all of them prior to the convention so I started with carrie sparing so this is a great

421
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,640
 book it is slow to start I think it lays down the groundwork and I found some of the characters a

422
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,840
 bit confusing because everyone has like a diminutive name and a proper name and there was a part of

423
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,480
 the novel where I had not entirely resolved whether some people were two characters or one character

424
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,520
 but by about page 50 I had got the hang of it so that's good but when it gets going

425
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,560
 whole it gets going it's very sexy and very tense sometimes at the same time it's an extraordinarily

426
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,720
 sexy book though oh full disclosure carries my mate I think living with ghosts is a very fine

427
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,800
 novel so first novel I think but all of carrie's writing is great you should read it all I'm

428
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,080
 delighted she's got a new book out of tista we should probably tout it um from Ian Waits and

429
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,600
 which is a collection of her Arthurian novellas and I'm really looking forward to that and reading

430
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:26,240
 that as well yes and also it's got a lovely cover what the new one yeah it does but yes that's my

431
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,200
 pick good book would highly recommend so I have a slightly left field pick today I am going to

432
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,680
 recommend a website called the owl job dot com side note do not just google owl job it has an

433
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:47,120
 urban dictionary meaning so the website the owl job is it's a website with design lessons from the

434
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:53,360
 owl job which is apparently Australia's first ever sightless escape room so it's a whole website

435
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:59,680
 about how they built this escape room deliberately so it was designed to be run either by people

436
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,040
 with low vision or for anyone who recited who was running the escape room they had to basically

437
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,520
 put on goggles and play it as though they were not cited but it's really interesting it gets into

438
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,160
 all the different things you have to do to basically make an escape room work for that group of people

439
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,080
 kind of a lot of it's sort of obvious but I never thought about it and a lot of it is really

440
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,320
 interesting and like okay you know this is just taking some universal rules of game design but

441
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,760
 making sure you apply them in this situation and it was things like having a coherent tactile

442
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,440
 language so that when they are feeling their way around the different puzzles they worked out what

443
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,360
 was the best arrow shape to have so they could always consistently find an arrow and they tried

444
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,200
 a bunch of designs that end up being confusing and they kind of show how they got to this one

445
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,760
 design that works and it sounded like a fascinating escape room and I really wish I'd been able to

446
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,400
 to try it out but it sounded great and it's essentially there to give the lessons they learned

447
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,600
 from this to other people and show them how designing a sightless game uh it's like this escape

448
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,600
 room does not have to be any more expensive or particularly difficult than designing any other

449
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,720
 escape room you just have to approach it in a slightly different way and I think they hope that

450
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,920
 there will be more escape rooms of this type so I think anyone who's interested in game design

451
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:18,000
 would really enjoy this website noise my pick so I haven't really I still not really been doing

452
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,520
 anything hopefully I'll be more or less back to normal next time we record I recommend

453
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:31,280
 Spider-man movies or a spider-man movie which is Spider-man far from home I'm never going to cope

454
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,840
 with two films which are sequels to or one of which is sequel to the other which are called

455
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,360
 Spider-man far from home and Spider-man no way home I think I think that's like poor marketing guys

456
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:47,040
 and you could have done better but anyway Spider-man far from home which I I kind of got to a point

457
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,040
 where I was like what do I need I need something that it should be like an action movie but maybe

458
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,520
 also a teen rom-com that's what I need and um so yeah it's great for the grief-stricken

459
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,960
 distracted because at no point in this movie do you think that any of the kids are in any actual

460
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,320
 danger because you know it's a teen rom-com movie so if one of the teams teams got stabbed through

461
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,240
 the heart that wouldn't quite fit the vibe it's like glorious candy floss and it has a little bit

462
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,040
 of multiverse and it it started to get that sort of sense of oh spider-man is more um more into the

463
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,520
 multiverse than most of the Marvel heroes and I quite like getting that sort of sense coming along

464
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,000
 in um in the in the mainstream movies and hopefully it'll all fit together in the third one which

465
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,560
 we'll watch in the next week or two I should think I know I'm like six years behind on Marvel don't

466
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,680
 write I think this is post-blip though so I think we're I'm like I've come to the end of the pre-blip

467
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,400
 movies I think apart from the whole Ant-Man set which I probably need to watch soon as well I am

468
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,840
 gonna catch up one day have you not watched the first Ant-Man yet no because we watched we had a

469
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,400
 choice this time between should we watch the first Ant-Man or should we watch Spider-Man far from home

470
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,960
 and we watch Spider-Man far from home should I've watched the first Ant-Man instead oh I think most

471
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,440
 people would disagree that you should have done but Ant-Man is like one of my favorite characters in the

472
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,800
 MCU so um okay I love them so I have quite a lot of movies as homework for for this fortnight so

473
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,480
 just like Michael Pena in every anything I'm like down she's very funny I like funny I do like

474
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,160
 in general Marvel is much better when I mean I like the funny bits right I don't like the

475
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,800
 superhero fight bits partly because I think if you see them in the if you go see them in the cinema

476
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,200
 then massive superhero fight fights are probably a lot of fun um but in in my living room with my

477
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,720
 slightly shitty slightly old TV I'm kind of like oh no this is this is not very exciting so so I

478
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,920
 like I like the jokes I'm there for the character development of the jokes please mmm that was the

479
00:42:49,920 --> 00:43:05,840
 art thought podcast and it's goodbye for me it's goodbye for me and it's goodbye for me

480
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,280
 is it Spock amok or is it supposed to be like Spock mok and it rhymes or is this a US UK

481
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,960
 difference well but a mock isn't pronounced a mock right is proud so muck it's going to be one

482
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,440
 of these things like squirrel girl where you discover having read the entire series that squirrel and

483
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,160
 girl rhyme in many parts of the US so it's sort of like squirrel girl which doesn't make any sense

484
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,600
 to me but there we go so it's probably spucker muck I did not know no fair enough spark a mark

485
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:55,440
 I think it probably is a US and US British um Spock amok Spock amok rhyme in my English actually

486
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,360
 there we go because I say a mock not a muck but it's pronounced a muck because pronunciation is a

487
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,600
 it's not a uniform thing and also I might just have learned it off reading books and therefore

488
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,920
 just pronounce it wrong possibly like I was 17 before I realized how you say the carver so it

489
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,920
 comes from the Portuguese amokko from the Malay amok so I think probably originally it was

490
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,800
 pronounced amok but I would not be surprised if there were parts of the world where it rhymes with

491
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,600
 Spock but I did say all of this on the last episode and we're just and we're just reiterating it for

492
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,200
 no reason did we say all of the last episode and you cut it out would be really boring yes I said

493
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,560
 literally out loud I think it's supposed to rhyme but I don't pronounce it to rhyme literally

494
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,240
 said that on episode 27 with my words oh I wasn't listening sorry so I'm gonna have to cut all of

495
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:51,120
 this out anyway because this is not interesting enough to revisit uh I did wonder I was like do

496
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,600
 they remember that I mentioned that and now I know the answer is no okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna

497
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:00,800
 say I spent I spent the last month in a distracted fog I don't remember anything at the moment
