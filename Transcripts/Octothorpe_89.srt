1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
 I've just read your hot, uh, we're gonna have an argument.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,960
 I didn't realise we're gonna have an argument.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,040
 Oh, yeah. No, I know.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,240
 Fair enough.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,160
 No, we're not. It's going to be very good.

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,640
 Nature.

7
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,840
 Because I don't feel very strongly about this.

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,920
 I just I just want to take one end of the argument for for podcasting sake.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:38,920
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 89th episode of Octa the Wop, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 3rd of August, 2023.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,040
 I'm John Coxon.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,440
 I'm Alison Scott.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,600
 And I'm Miss Batty.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,840
 And we have letters of comments.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:57,720
 Firstly, we have a letter of comment from Abigail Nussbaum, who says she is writing to come down on Liz's side regarding Plutoshine,

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,440
 but says that she agrees with Alison, the taken on its own.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,760
 Plutoshine is a decent example of the sort of SF you would have a droid as a kid.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,440
 But the reason she read it was because it was on the Clark shortlist and that's a choice she finds a silly baffling.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,720
 I I I would say I also find it baffling that it's on a shortlist despite quite enjoying it.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,440
 She also says Goliath's an astonishing novel, but quite hard going.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,920
 I'm still halfway through Goliath.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,080
 So maybe next time.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,280
 Liz, do you want to talk about how I'm right?

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,680
 Abigail says that Goliath is at a work that is deliberately trying to be hard to read and she too found it a bit slow going.

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,120
 She mentions Emmy iterants as the Moon Day letters, which she thinks is a brilliant novel.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,600
 We talked about that on the pods when I picked it after Neil and Nick gave it to me for my birthday.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,720
 Interestingly, my wife really didn't get on with the Moon Day letters because she basically found the conceit.

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,040
 Because part of the conceit of the novel is you can work out what's happening faster than the main character can.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,240
 Like the protagonist is not aware of a thing that is being made aware to you, the reader,

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:09,440
 but it's been your fundamentally did not believe that any adult would not be able to put together what was happening with the evidence they had in front of them and found the conceit that the main character had not utterly, utterly frustrating.

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,600
 And so kept asking me if it got good.

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,280
 So yes.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
 I'll push to my list.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
 I feel the need to express her opinions for the sake of balance.

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,920
 But I'm looking forward to reading Perta Shrine, I'm ready yet will be after my Hugo reading.

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,200
 And Edward Moreland also wrote in to thank Liz for her irritation.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,840
 Yes, more listeners should write in to tell me when I am correct.

37
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,360
 Thank you.

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,240
 On the subject of books we did or did not enjoy.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,320
 We got some submissions to our book throwing competition.

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,400
 So this is the annual for new listeners.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,840
 The annual up to the competition where we ask our listeners to throw a book, measure how far it went.

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,560
 And then the winner receives a party.

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,720
 No, no, no, no, no, no, the river, the winner does not receive a pie.

44
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,640
 That's the only thing I said then, new listeners that isn't correct.

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,280
 All the rest was stone cold fact.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,640
 But Farah threw ash by Mary gentle across the room and said it's supposed to be written by an academic historian,

47
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,440
 which I assume means that Farah did not find the portrayal of academic history realistic.

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,360
 Not being an academic.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,960
 I really like cash.

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,120
 Not being an academic historian.

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,000
 I didn't know it was any of that.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
 And I really liked it.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,840
 I think Ash was pretty awesome.

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,960
 Yeah, good book.

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,040
 This is this is for shadowing slightly for our six weeks episode.

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,440
 Don't come and Gregor on Mastodon said that he would tell us the book.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,040
 He's throwing hardest across the room, but he thinks it's author might follow him on Mastodon.

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,480
 So he simply said that it was very hard.

59
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,280
 SF and he loves their short stories, but their novels are clearly part of a linear accelerator experiment.

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,080
 And Alexandra Lane's commented to say that it's called hard SF because it doesn't deform when it hits things.

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,320
 Thank you both.

62
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,240
 Are we allowed to speculate about the author?

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,440
 What's the book? What's the book?

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,040
 Yeah, come on, come on Duncan.

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,240
 Slide into our DMs.

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,680
 Give us give us that hot gas.

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,360
 We promise we won't read out on the pot.

68
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,520
 I mean, my, my guess is.

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,160
 Could be.

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,280
 Can we look at the list of who follows Duncan on?

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,240
 We've got to look at the list of people who are on Mastodon because Duncan didn't check if they follow him.

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,480
 He just said he thinks they might.

73
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,440
 So they're definitely on Mastodon.

74
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:24,080
 Laurie Anderson wrote in saying that she was up for dueling six weeks episode and she suggested two names.

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,000
 So this is a pun from our group chat listeners behind the curtain.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,920
 So our group chat is called Hugh GoktoThorp Girl, which is even harder to say in a sassy way than Hugh Gogirl is.

77
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,240
 So Hugh Gogirl is easy to say in a sassy way now that we've practiced.

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,120
 I just pronounced as Hock Octothorp Girl.

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
 She's nice.

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,640
 Oh.

81
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,720
 Oh.

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,120
 Hock Octothorp Girl.

83
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
 That's, that is nice.

84
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,640
 Yeah.

85
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,240
 But she suggests we call it Hock Octothorp Girl presents 12 weeks, but then further suggested, oh,

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,880
 or we could call it six takes because there are six of us and I did quite like that name.

87
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,960
 That is a very good name.

88
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
 Oh, that's very good.

89
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,200
 It's quite good.

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,360
 I'm not sure we only have three takes between the three of us.

91
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,600
 No, but I think for the pun, right.

92
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,520
 Anyway, movie on.

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,560
 Rajtooted about episode 87, he would prefer the moose sized Alison on the grounds that he could bribe her,

94
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,800
 not to fight using tea and cake, which, you know, just thinking outside the box.

95
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,360
 OK, so the word for the words tea and cake, substitute beer and cheese and you might be getting somewhere.

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,080
 Yeah, Alison doesn't like sweet things as much as savory things.

97
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,040
 That is true.

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,920
 He also said he's a bit disappointed with the president of the last two years that has been overturned

99
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,360
 regarding credits and wonders if this is a cultural thing in China.

100
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,000
 I'm going to explain it.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,760
 And then Alison and Liz can tell me if they think that I have to cut the explanation out.

102
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,560
 So if this then immediately jumps to Raj's next two listeners, you know why.

103
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,480
 Oh, no, we cannot say that.

104
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,560
 I think we can.

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,400
 It's true.

106
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,560
 No, you can't say that.

107
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,280
 Raj, I'm simply going to answer your question by telling you that we are below what is widely referred to as the McCarthy threshold

108
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,600
 and leave it at that.

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
 You can ask us more questions in the bar.

110
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,120
 Raj also says, what does the 17 point lead mean?

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,400
 He looked, but he couldn't find anything.

112
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,720
 I think it literally means 17 votes.

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,200
 So 17 people that cast votes.

114
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,320
 It's not it's not 17%.

115
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,080
 I know that because that would have that would definitely have trounced

116
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,640
 skills even with the double, I think.

117
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,160
 So, Erset's culture to it is and said they found a video on

118
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,640
 the internet, which like had some bona fide wrecks and says the other one that they brought up

119
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,120
 seems a different beast for reasons that eventually get around to documenting property.

120
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,640
 And then they sent us a follow up email, basically kind of going in some of the details of this,

121
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,480
 but says they're not ready to go into the details they hit in the toot yet.

122
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,040
 And so what we're going to do is we're going to leave this discussion for later

123
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,640
 and come back to it when there is more information available.

124
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,760
 He does say at the end of his email, I'll still keep listening to you every fortnight, regardless.

125
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,520
 Thank you very much, Erset's culture.

126
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,240
 We're glad to have you on board.

127
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,320
 We also heard from Roman Orzansky, given the comments about world

128
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,000
 translating English names into phonetic sounds and Alison's comment that some people are given

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,240
 a Chinese name when studying Chinese and that the world cons should have asked for their Chinese names.

130
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,520
 One has to ask what are the Chinese names of members of the Octo-Thop cast?

131
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
 I don't think any of us have one.

132
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,440
 No, but if I get one, I'll let you know, Roman, because I might do.

133
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,840
 Learning Chinese is one of the things on my very, very long list of things I want to do,

134
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,080
 given that I'm going to live forever.

135
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,160
 And then Roman threw a book against the wall, which was one of Robert Heinlein's later works.

136
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,520
 And Roman thinks it was either the number of the beast or the cat who walks through walls,

137
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,080
 but he doesn't want to have to bother to actually find out which it was,

138
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
 which I think is entirely fair, Roman.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,320
 Thank you for hanging in.

140
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,920
 I think the only Heinlein I've ever read is Starship Troopers.

141
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,200
 I don't think I've read anything else.

142
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
 I might be wrong.

143
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,160
 I've read Starship Troopers, I think.

144
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,040
 And I read some of his juveniles when I was a juvenile and quite enjoyed them.

145
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,800
 Mean last week, Liz.

146
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,240
 Oh, sing.

147
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:23,120
 We've saved a letter for last, which is Christopher J. Garcia.

148
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:31,240
 And he writes in, says that his kids asked whether Batti was Liz's goth name,

149
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,360
 fully aware that Chris's goth name is trying to clear on we.

150
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,280
 And if he had ever met Alison and Bella calm down enough to say they sound like

151
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,480
 they're from the East Coast.

152
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,160
 And I think anyone listening would agree that we all sound like we live on the East

153
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,680
 Coast of the USA.

154
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,200
 This is definitely what East Coast accents sound like.

155
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,080
 Yes, I sound particularly like I'm from Boston, definitely.

156
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,320
 He's working on the SF book of lists to list harder, which might take a while,

157
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,720
 meaning he can't work on the Batti criminal detective agency stories for a while,

158
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 but he does have the title for a book murder from the third row.

159
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
 It's a good name.

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,040
 So when he's right, that's good.

161
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,760
 Name, good.

162
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,600
 Name, it's pretty good.

163
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
 Yeah, you should write that, Chris, and we can we can just go to my share of royalties later.

164
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
 Not that great.

165
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
 No, it's my criminal detective agency.

166
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
 I can't be the first victim, can I?

167
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,960
 There'll be a twist.

168
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,680
 Yeah, quite an old twist.

169
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,880
 That was all the letters of comment.

170
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,800
 Thank you people for writing in.

171
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,360
 Oh, that was not let's comment.

172
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,480
 It was.

173
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,000
 Thank you, chonky.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Transcription.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,280
 So we have submitted to the Hugo voter packet listeners.

176
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,560
 Probably if you're already a listener, you're not going to go back and look at our

177
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,320
 submission because you've already heard all the episodes.

178
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:59,320
 But we have given episode 49, 62 and 72 to the Hugo voter packet.

179
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,040
 And we've given all of our cover art as well.

180
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,360
 And we've done transcripts for those three episodes.

181
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,880
 And we would like to know whether anyone listening interacts with transcripts for any

182
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,840
 podcasts and if they do, what is it you want from your transcripts?

183
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,520
 None of the three of us use transcripts for podcasts.

184
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,080
 And so we would be keen to know what people find useful and what they don't.

185
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,560
 Because we're kind of guessing, which, you know, makes it hard to do a good job, I think.

186
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,960
 So if anyone does have any opinions, please do write in.

187
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,320
 I think having it on GitHub is good and we should probably put all the other transcripts

188
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,760
 we've done on GitHub as well.

189
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,680
 Yes.

190
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,320
 So we do now have a GitHub of our transcripts and subtitles.

191
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,800
 What I'll probably do.

192
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,040
 So at the moment, it's just got the three that we put in for the Hugo voter packet.

193
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,600
 I will probably put in the automated whisper, a I generated transcripts as well.

194
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 They are not as good as the ones we've been through and fixed, but they are still pretty good.

195
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,880
 They're definitely good enough to kind of get a feel for what we're talking about.

196
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,600
 And as someone who does use subtitles on like YouTube videos and stuff, they're

197
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,920
 better than a lot of those.

198
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,680
 So those will be going as well.

199
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,520
 But if you want to look at transcripts or subtitles, head over to the GitHub, which

200
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,880
 has a link in the show notes.

201
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,840
 Yeah, we do also have them by way in the subtitle format.

202
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,480
 So if you want to listen to the pod with subtitles, you can do that either from our

203
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,680
 Poppin page or by running the subtitles yourself in the media player of your choice.

204
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,600
 And then finally, I was transcribing episode 72 and we decided in that episode that we

205
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:39,360
 should do our Octavursary podcast in either episode 80 or episode 88 and coming to you

206
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,800
 from the lands of episode 89, I can confirm that we did not do either of those things.

207
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,920
 Hoorah!

208
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,320
 We're very geared as monkeys towards base 10.

209
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,120
 So you will find a celebration in episode 100 if we're still going by then.

210
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,960
 Alison is showing her 10 digits to the camera.

211
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,760
 Oh, God, that sounded kinkier than I anticipated it would when I started.

212
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
 I am.

213
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,040
 I am now wondering about doing us as eight digit monkeys, eight finger monkeys.

214
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,240
 Oh, yes, that would be good.

215
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,920
 I like that.

216
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,680
 That's right.

217
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,160
 AI, because of the number of fingers being wrong.

218
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,200
 I love it.

219
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,600
 Yeah.

220
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
 No, the number of fingers are wrong, but inconsistent.

221
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,400
 Yes.

222
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,200
 Also, would these be AI generated transcripts?

223
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:35,680
 So we're going to move on to Glasgow in 2034.

224
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,560
 Shall we talk about Liz's role first and then do AI?

225
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,440
 We can do Liz has taken a role for Glasgow in 2024.

226
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,440
 And she is the area head of podcasting program.

227
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,080
 Yes.

228
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,600
 I don't know how no one knows about that.

229
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,560
 As far as I know, it is not on the website or anything.

230
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,960
 Esther told me.

231
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
 Oh, Esther told you.

232
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,560
 OK.

233
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
 Yes.

234
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,560
 No, I am on the website now.

235
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,680
 I am down as podcasting content area head and it is still very early days as in

236
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,760
 which I mean, I haven't really done anything yet.

237
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
 Can we can we do a podcast?

238
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,960
 Can we do a lot of focus?

239
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,280
 Can we can we can we can we?

240
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,160
 I believe there will be ways in which you can, you know, submit to your pro.

241
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
 In fact, there's only way you can submit your program ideas.

242
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,760
 So go and fill in the form.

243
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:27,320
 But yes, by podcasting content, it means both live podcasts and program items about

244
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,320
 podcasting and I will sort of, you know, look at the suggestions, come up with some

245
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,840
 suggestions of our own, curate them into a podcasting stream at Glasgow in 2024.

246
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,120
 So should you have any great ideas about podcast program or any other program,

247
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,160
 to be honest, please submit them through our page where you can suggest program items.

248
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,440
 I have an idea for a panel. The title of the panel is why don't

249
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,760
 podcasters shout and the blurb is why are our podcasts just shout?

250
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,880
 Why use microphone?

251
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,680
 Our panel discusses the pros and cons of literally shouting into the void.

252
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,600
 What do you reckon?

253
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,960
 It's existential.

254
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,400
 Liz has written in the show notes.

255
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,320
 Please put this into the program suggestion form John.

256
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,600
 OK, Liz, I will do that.

257
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,040
 I'm going to do it on the podcast.

258
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,480
 Yeah, and we apparently have to put can we have

259
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,360
 thought live into the program suggestion form?

260
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,400
 I'm assuming that the entire purpose of this is to prevent of Liz's

261
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 appointment is to prevent me from messaging Esther every time I think.

262
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,200
 Oh, and another thing you need to do for podcasters is yeah, this just seems

263
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,560
 you're going to message me, doesn't it?

264
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,600
 I've not really thought this through 100 percent.

265
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,880
 Now I'm going to tell you all the part.

266
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,080
 Oh, no, put it.

267
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,400
 Put it in the form.

268
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,560
 Can't.

269
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,040
 I've submitted the form, Liz.

270
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,880
 Boom.

271
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,040
 OK, yeah.

272
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,200
 So some of the stuff I've been saying hasn't been the sort of thing you put on the

273
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,160
 form because it's more kind of how you would structure the convention to make it

274
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,160
 podcast friendly in the same way that you might do how you would structure the

275
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,200
 convention to make it fancy and friendly, right?

276
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,280
 That sort of thing.

277
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,480
 I make the world con tailor the fan, the world con more to my specific needs.

278
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,560
 Yes.

279
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,200
 I await I listen to many messages and emails on this topic over the next year.

280
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,000
 So let's go to 2024 have released a statement about their policy on the use

281
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,720
 of AI art, which they say is a result of con consultation with the Association

282
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,560
 of Science Fiction and Fancy Artists and with artists at various conventions and

283
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,840
 looking at the policies of other conventions.

284
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,240
 But basically they will not accept artwork into the art show that comprises

285
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,200
 anything that was created using text to image AI generators or was created using

286
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,600
 compiler or generator that relies on the use of other artists images without the

287
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
 express permission of the artist.

288
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,880
 So basically if you have used one of these

289
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,560
 systems to generate art without the permission, maybe of the artist whose work

290
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,480
 on the lies it, then you cannot put it into the art show and they would prefer

291
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,440
 you also not to sell it in the dealer's room.

292
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,440
 And if you only have air artwork, you will that will be taken into consideration

293
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,600
 when they give you dooders room tables.

294
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,880
 So basically a strong thumbs down to AI generated art.

295
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,160
 So I have views and this is views based on the fact that I have spent my entire

296
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,120
 career as a fan artist with people saying, oh, no, you're not doing real art because

297
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,440
 I've always been using available digital tools.

298
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,400
 So when I started doing art, I started in a programme called Paint Shop Pro doing

299
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,320
 collaging and no, I was I was doing parody art of of movie posters.

300
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,600
 I didn't get the permission of the movie poster, the movie makers to do that.

301
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,720
 It's still fan art.

302
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,800
 It's still art.

303
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,880
 If you use any of the following, if you use any sort of Photoshop or any other photo

304
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,160
 manipulation programme, there's tons of machine learning in that.

305
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,600
 If you use fonts, they're all based on original work of artists because there's

306
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,520
 no copyright in fonts in the US.

307
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,640
 If you if you use a phone camera, then you're the reason that phones,

308
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,760
 despite having tiny cameras, give much better pictures than cameras, which have

309
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,800
 great big lenses, is because phones have machine learning in them.

310
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,720
 So they are building on incredibly large databases of photography and nobody

311
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,840
 complains about them.

312
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,800
 But suddenly when this piece of

313
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,680
 art of manipulation comes along, people are like, oh, no, it's based on looking at

314
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,880
 a billion pictures in some way.

315
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,320
 That's terribly much worse than everything else.

316
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,800
 And, you know, it's scary.

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
 There are artists who put paint on paper.

318
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,040
 It's scary because new tools are scary.

319
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,360
 But essentially, A, it's the future.

320
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,200
 And we're science fiction fans.

321
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,600
 And science fiction fandom should be when science fiction comes and knocks on the

322
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,720
 door and says, here I am, here's the future.

323
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,480
 We shouldn't always be going, oh, no, let us demonstrate that we are the most

324
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,880
 lotite and reactionary people on the planet.

325
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,160
 So, you know, I think this is totally the wrong decision.

326
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,960
 I think that art that is completely machine-generated is rubbish at the moment.

327
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,760
 And that's why it's not in your art show because it's rubbish and you have a

328
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,680
 quality-thritter old.

329
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,800
 And I think that lots of real artists are doing great work by taking the stuff that

330
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,520
 comes out of machine learning generators and then improving it.

331
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
 And I think that's fine.

332
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,280
 That they weren't accepted into the art show that comprises anything using text to image

333
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,400
 AI generators, stuff like mid-journey or

334
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,320
 darly and they won't let you use any compiler generator that relies on the use

335
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,440
 of other artist images without the permission of the artist.

336
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,360
 So I think they should probably make allowances for parody or commentary, as

337
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:37,320
 Alison says, because I do think, you know, there is value in art, which does kind

338
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,800
 of remix stuff in ways that are respected by copyright law in many countries at

339
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,680
 the moment.

340
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,000
 And I don't think having a strict line on that than, for example, the US's copyright

341
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,440
 laws is helpful.

342
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,520
 Because, yeah, I think I think a right to, you know, if someone does do a parody of

343
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,320
 a sort of misogynistic movie poster to make some science fiction art, like, is

344
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,360
 that something Glasgow will look down on?

345
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,600
 I rather imagine not.

346
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,440
 So this this statement needs to reflect that.

347
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,560
 I do think none of the examples of AI that Alison gave in terms of like Photoshop

348
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,800
 filters or phone cameras uses an artist's image without the express permission of

349
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,360
 that artist.

350
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,200
 So all of that would be fine.

351
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,280
 I think you could probably have an argument there.

352
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,600
 But I think by having that argument, you're doing a disservice to what Glasgow is

353
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,160
 trying to do here.

354
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,200
 And I think it's possible to agree with the I mean, I have a wife who is an artist

355
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
 who is very against AI art.

356
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:44,040
 I don't think it's fair to characterize the SF community valuing human labor as

357
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,600
 reactionary and luddite.

358
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,080
 I think there is an argument here about the society we want to use our technology

359
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,840
 to build and if that society doesn't involve humans, I'm broadly against it.

360
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,440
 And so I think it's more nuanced than that and probably an argument that's too

361
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,960
 much to go into on the pod.

362
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,840
 But I don't know.

363
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,440
 It's tricky.

364
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,400
 I in general don't disagree with the spirit of the statement.

365
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,360
 Like I say, I would introduce exceptions for parody and for commentary.

366
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,120
 But like in general, I don't have a big problem with this.

367
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,520
 And I think it's been here.

368
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,040
 We'll quite likes this kind of statement made.

369
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,520
 So I very deliberately put a piece of art that had involved

370
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,800
 AI generation into my Hugo Vert packet.

371
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,280
 I described it as my bid for being ranked below no award.

372
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,800
 So but you know, I did it quite deliberately because I think it's really

373
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,800
 important to say you can make excellent, unique individual work using these tools

374
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,520
 as part of what you do, but Glasgow doesn't want it because they're wrong.

375
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,040
 There is a, I mean, there is a personal taste thing here as well.

376
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,400
 Right.

377
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,320
 Like all of my favorite pieces of Alison's art that she's done for the podcast

378
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,120
 are the ones that don't involve AI and all of my least favorite ones are the ones

379
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,480
 that do and I don't think that's a coincidence.

380
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,680
 Oh, thanks a lot.

381
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,480
 Sorry.

382
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
 I think it would be interesting for you to say which those are.

383
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,040
 And for me to say, ah, because you don't know when I'm using AI.

384
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,160
 It's usually quite obvious because they're the ones that don't like look like your

385
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,240
 art style, like you have an art style and sometimes you do things.

386
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,440
 And I go, that's quite a new art direction.

387
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,160
 And then it turns out that it's because you use my journey for part of it.

388
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,320
 And I'm like, oh, that makes sense.

389
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,640
 But like one of the things I like about art is people's style and I doesn't have one.

390
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,880
 And like, that's not a dis.

391
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,440
 OK.

392
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,120
 So one of the things that's going on with AI as well is that Britain's absolutely

393
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,320
 no question for most science fictional artist is making and selling AI generated

394
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,880
 artwork.

395
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,120
 I like Jim Burns's art in general.

396
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,560
 I mean, I think he's my maybe not my favorite art in the art show, but I do like

397
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,560
 his paintings and I honestly could not tell that his art in the art show was AI

398
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,840
 until I saw the note saying it was AI.

399
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,240
 But I also wonder how much of this is how much has that AI model been trained

400
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,200
 in Jim Burns's art.

401
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,400
 So even if it's not in the art show, I think it would be really interesting if he's

402
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,920
 at Glasgow for Glasgow to ask him to talk through how he does this because as

403
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,360
 probably one of the I would say one of the few big name artists I've seen who

404
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,040
 seems to be pro AI art generation, it would be really interesting to see what he

405
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,920
 sees as the pros of it and how he actually does it, which might give people more of

406
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,080
 an insight into how it's done because I think there is this.

407
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,120
 There are people who definitely think you can just go like to mid journey and type,

408
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,120
 give me some Jim Burns style art of a cat alien and it will give you like a

409
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,160
 perfect painting, which it won't.

410
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,080
 But I can also see that Glasgow are trying to draw a line somewhere.

411
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,760
 And I think there is a line between the fact that my phone camera will try and

412
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,440
 enhance like a picture of a cow I took yesterday and something which sort of

413
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,480
 generates an image from whole cloth to be altered.

414
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,960
 Now, maybe I'm not particularly consistent in that, but I do think there is a

415
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,520
 difference and you also have to do have to think about training sets and training

416
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,680
 data and what has been used.

417
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,720
 And I can also do that if Photoshop has a thing saying your data will be used for

418
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,720
 training, then there is a slight difference between that and a data set, which has

419
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
 been scraped entirely from the internet.

420
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,960
 Like I may not have very prominently given my consent to my Photoshop images

421
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,240
 being in their data set, but maybe I have in a way that I haven't if it's just like

422
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,480
 a Cleveland art gallery has been scraped.

423
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,840
 And yeah, I'd say also this is Glasgow's policy.

424
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,000
 It doesn't necessarily follow that every single convention for the

425
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 infinite future is going to follow that.

426
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,560
 It might be this is Glasgow's policy and other ones walk it back somewhere.

427
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,520
 But I do think it is a debate that needs to be had.

428
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,080
 And if they're going to have policy, I'm glad they've put the policy out now

429
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,160
 before people start planning for the art show and finding that actually it's not allowed.

430
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,800
 I think it's good to get it out early and have a chat about it.

431
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,640
 And I do think it would be good if they had drawn a distinction between

432
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,560
 scraped data sets and with the scraped without permission and data sets where all of the

433
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,520
 data is used with permission, which they absolutely haven't done.

434
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,080
 So, OK, so I want to say four things now.

435
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,480
 Firstly, I agree with both of you props to Glasgow for having this statement out

436
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,800
 more than a year in advance.

437
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
 That's very good.

438
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,080
 Secondly, I agree there needs to be a debate on this.

439
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,320
 I just looked through the Tracon 8 program and there is not a single item in which

440
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,200
 writers or creators discuss AI and what it means for the field.

441
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,440
 Now, I will say I don't think it's fair to characterize opposition to AI as being

442
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,360
 like against the spirit of the SF community.

443
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,440
 But I do think not discussing it is definitely against the spirit of the SF

444
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,200
 community.

445
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,000
 Like this is something that is coming and is a technology that will become very

446
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,480
 important, regardless of your opinion on it.

447
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,400
 And so it does surprise me that the WorldCon last year did not have any forum for

448
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,640
 that.

449
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,360
 I hope that Glasgow will have a forum for that.

450
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,920
 And I'm not putting that in the program.

451
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,600
 I program request form Esther and Liz.

452
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,200
 You're going to have to listen to this and you're going to have to take it on board

453
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,560
 as verbal feedback.

454
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,760
 Thirdly, completely on board with AI models.

455
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,720
 You can train a model on your own computer using examples of your own work.

456
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,960
 And there is examples of artists who have done this and writers who have done this

457
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,360
 on completely on board with that.

458
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:30,200
 And fourthly, I do think Glasgow is trying to draw a distinction here between

459
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,360
 scraping and plagiarism and using these tools with permission.

460
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,320
 I do think when they say created using any compiler or generator that relies on the

461
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,800
 use of other artists images without the express permission in the artist, I think

462
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,640
 that's what they're trying to do.

463
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,920
 I'm not necessarily saying I disagree with Alison, but I think they could do it

464
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,400
 better.

465
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,880
 But I do think the spirit of this statement is that what I will say is it gets really

466
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,040
 tricky with long and terminable terms and conditions where it's buried in like

467
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,400
 sub paragraph five of like because on the one hand, they have technically

468
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,360
 consented, but on the other hand, I am a big fan of enthusiastic consent.

469
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,160
 And so I get very fuzzy there where I'm like, I think that's really hard

470
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,920
 argument to have.

471
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,880
 And I think you can get very nuanced in what you think about that.

472
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,000
 But I do think in general, I'm not necessarily disagreeing with Alison that

473
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,360
 this could be worded better.

474
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,120
 But I think I think they are trying to draw that distinction.

475
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:28,440
 And then fifthly, sorry, I will say they did apparently develop this statement

476
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,600
 in consultation with the with Asper, which is the Association of Science

477
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,240
 Fiction and Family, artists, Sarah Felix is their chair.

478
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,720
 And that's another thing I just want to highlight.

479
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,680
 Like they clearly have tried not to just levy this from a bunch of people who

480
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,840
 haven't talked to artists, they have clearly tried to do a consultation, whether

481
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,720
 or not they've done that widely enough.

482
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,720
 But those are those are my things.

483
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,880
 It is not unusual for people who are already successful in the field to pull up

484
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:03,000
 the drawbridge against new technology that might might attack their position of

485
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,600
 privilege.

486
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,640
 So I think that's a core thing that's going on here is yes, people who have made

487
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,440
 their money using paint on paper and I fully accept that science fiction authors

488
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,680
 and not particularly, it's not a particular lucrative field.

489
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,920
 But then there's going to be absolutely on point on trying to prevent any technology

490
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,200
 that isn't paint on paper.

491
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,920
 Well, but I don't think so like this Banyo is a member of Asper.

492
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,960
 So I don't think I don't think you have to pay to join.

493
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,880
 I think there's also a few a few a paint on paper.

494
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,800
 Well, I literally never heard of it until this podcast.

495
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,440
 So, you know, what?

496
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
 Yeah.

497
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,400
 It's like the OK, so it's like the it's like the American.

498
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,920
 It's like the social right of America, right?

499
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,480
 Well, I mean, firstly, the science fiction

500
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,880
 writer's America doesn't exist anymore.

501
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,160
 It's now the science fiction writer's association.

502
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,000
 And yes, it is American based, but like it is it is the kind of science fiction

503
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,520
 group for artists.

504
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,240
 So like, I think I don't think you have to.

505
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,720
 I don't think it costs money to join.

506
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,120
 I think it's just a thing you can join if you are a science fiction artist.

507
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,760
 One of the things I will say is it has frustrated me that they don't present

508
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,880
 the Chesleys, which is their award.

509
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,520
 They don't present the Chesleys outside America very often.

510
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,960
 I wish they did because I do think the field is better for having Asper.

511
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,760
 I think they did in 2014.

512
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,080
 I think they do sometimes, but not as like.

513
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,520
 But yeah, I'm surprised I listened to them because they are basically, you know,

514
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,160
 the biggest association of science fiction and fantasy artists.

515
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,320
 And yeah, they do they don't present the Chesleys outside the US very often,

516
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,920
 but they do.

517
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,600
 Octa Thorpe, artists corner, Alice says, what are say's 10,000?

518
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,360
 I'm trying to get better at the XKCD model of this.

519
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,120
 I mean, no one's heard of everything, right?

520
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,680
 So the always the day when you find out about a thing is just today's a good day.

521
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,720
 To be fair, I had heard of the Chesleys because it was relevant at Lunkon.

522
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,440
 That's fair.

523
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,680
 Well, and that's the other thing, right?

524
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,320
 Like, I'm sure there are people who have heard of the Hugo Awards who haven't heard

525
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,480
 of like World Cora Wasvus.

526
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,920
 So the award is usually the bit you've heard of if you've heard of any of it.

527
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:16,720
 So moving on from the contentious issue of AI use in art to the completely

528
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,440
 contention free issue of Chinese sponsored chips to China, Hugo finalists were

529
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,320
 offered a free trip to the Chengdu Worldcon.

530
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,120
 Every finalist was offered one free trip.

531
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,240
 So one of me, Alison Orlys would go if some of them went.

532
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,520
 And Alison has also been offered a free trip in her capacity as glorious Hugo

533
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,480
 finalist for fan artists.

534
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,240
 So Alison, are you going to China?

535
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,640
 So I haven't actually told them I'm not going, but I'm not going.

536
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,320
 And my mixed my reasons are a mix of of the sorts of political ones that we are

537
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,880
 hearing a number of people saying, but also some personal ones that it falls right

538
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,040
 in the middle of my guff trip and it wouldn't actually be very practical.

539
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,240
 So it is a mixture of both.

540
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,400
 I'm slightly sad not to be going to China because I would love to meet a lot of

541
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,160
 Chinese fans in their home environment.

542
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,040
 But I'm not 100% certain that would happen at the Chengdu Worldcon anyway.

543
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,000
 So I might do better by just going to a round of Chinese universities,

544
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,520
 say, can I hang out with Sartre's, which has started for a bit.

545
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,920
 Liz, are you going to China?

546
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,080
 I mean, probably not.

547
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,800
 Although to me, the whether I get a sponsored trip or not doesn't really make

548
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,200
 much of a difference because I'm geographically far closer and it's far

549
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,040
 easy for me to go.

550
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,640
 So I haven't found complete.

551
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,040
 I probably won't go, which is partly for personal circumstances.

552
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,000
 It's a really awkward time of the year and partly because I'm not super into his

553
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,080
 about Chengdu and yeah, I think it might be like the handful of non-Chinese

554
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,040
 speakers all hanging out together and not having much interaction with the Chinese

555
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,040
 fans. But I think that depends very much on how many of the Chinese fans are

556
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,800
 bilingual and that I don't know.

557
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,520
 It could be higher than I think and also how much do they actually want to

558
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,440
 chat to people and how much do they want to meet other Chinese science fiction fans.

559
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,040
 So I'm not going, probably not going, but it's not like entirely as a protest

560
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,600
 saying it's just partly also a logistical thing.

561
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,760
 I'm not going either.

562
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:20,320
 Who wants to do their pick first?

563
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,160
 Shall I do mine?

564
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,480
 Because it's the end of the summer of cricket and summer of fun.

565
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,400
 And I'll be back to normal, normal having time for things that are not cricket,

566
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,800
 like maybe an audio book.

567
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,360
 So I have been reading Beyond a Boundary by C.L.R.

568
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,520
 James. James is a very interesting person.

569
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,920
 He was born and raised in Trinidad where he was given the best education that

570
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,160
 colonialism could provide in Trinidad and then went on to be a great supporter

571
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,560
 of post-colonialism, self-rule.

572
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,520
 And he was in Marxist.

573
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,480
 He as well as kind of supporting West India Federation of Somewhat, but also for

574
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,320
 island recognition.

575
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,040
 He did a lot of other interesting things too, but he was also the cricket

576
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,440
 correspondent of the Guardian and this book was described as the best book about

577
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,240
 cricket ever written and it is very good.

578
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,520
 He writes very well.

579
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:22,400
 It's very strange the way that he he kind of because this is what happened to

580
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,280
 Bright Lad's in Trinidad at the time, he's kind of soaked in in this sort of

581
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:35,240
 sense of the British education system, but then he gradually comes away from that

582
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,680
 to work out what he actually thinks for himself and all the time measured through

583
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,200
 the rule of cricket.

584
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,320
 You probably have to know a little bit about cricket to enjoy this book, but not

585
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,240
 a huge amount because he is talking about cricket and about West Indian cricketers.

586
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,480
 But he is using this as a way of talking about colonialism and race and identity

587
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,880
 and what it means to be a trinity, a daddy and a cricketer and a West Indian and

588
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,640
 all of that.

589
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,480
 And it is fascinating really enjoying it.

590
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,280
 Has nothing to do with Sartre's picture, guys, but cricket.

591
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,160
 Quick recommendation on sort of similar lines.

592
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:16,600
 If you want to hear Miles Jupp, who is a rather good stand up who used to host the

593
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,640
 quiz ruminate on the nature of identity and the nature of knowing what you want to

594
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:29,640
 do with your life through a lens of cricket, his stand up show is very good on

595
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,760
 the subject and I believe it is on Amazon Prime.

596
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:38,320
 I think you've got to pay for like a little uplift and it is called Fibber in the

597
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,120
 Heat. Liz, do you want to do a pick?

598
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,080
 Yeah, I do pick.

599
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,520
 I'm going to pick a fancy book.

600
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,240
 What?

601
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,240
 I'm going to pick the last blade priest by W.L.

602
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,200
 Wild, which I happened to know Abigail, not spamming, but this is just plain Abigail

603
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,520
 bait, really.

604
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,320
 It is a fancy novel.

605
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,040
 I think it's the first in a trilogy or certainly the first in a series because it

606
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,480
 doesn't really have an ending.

607
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,560
 It is secondary world fantasy.

608
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,960
 Basically, you have kind of converging narratives, one of whom is the last

609
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:16,280
 blade priest from essentially a weird religion where they worship a god mountain.

610
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,880
 They have demigods who are sort of bird people and Anton is the the blade priest

611
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,280
 from a religion where they used to have human sacrifices, but now they no longer

612
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:32,040
 do and the other plot strand is essentially a builder, a master builder from a kingdom

613
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,400
 who have fought a war against a league of free cities and just completely lost and

614
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:44,040
 now subjected to them and he has taken off on a quest essentially to build sort

615
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,880
 of a path towards this god mountain.

616
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,200
 I can't really describe it because it like if I tried to give you a summary of a

617
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,760
 500 page fancy novel with multiple viewpoints, then there's just way more to it.

618
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,920
 As big of secondary world fantasies go, I did enjoy it.

619
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,080
 I think the world building is good.

620
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,720
 I think the viewpoint characters are all interesting characters and it does have

621
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,960
 kind of interesting world building. I like this kind of idea of like it is a

622
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,880
 world where you have an empire, but you also have these smaller kingdoms and you

623
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,680
 also have this league of free cities where they don't have a king.

624
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,760
 They're sort of more of a grouping and they're trying to decide, OK, if we've

625
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,840
 conquered this nation in a war, actually, what is the best way?

626
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,080
 Do we completely subjugate them or do we try and bring them into the league?

627
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,720
 That sort of thing, different attitudes to religion and magic and so on.

628
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,320
 There are elves, but some very interesting elves.

629
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,920
 I found them pretty interesting and yeah, so I really quite enjoyed it.

630
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,120
 It is too long and it doesn't really have an ending.

631
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,600
 But if I was going to ding fantasy books for being too long and not really have an

632
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,520
 ending, that is I find an awful lot of them that I read.

633
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,720
 So I quite enjoyed it.

634
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,040
 So I think that's why I will probably read the next one.

635
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,160
 If by the time it comes out, I can still remember what happened in this one,

636
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,880
 which is always my failing with fantasy trilatives.

637
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,680
 But I am still thinking, OK, I would quite like to read the second one rather than

638
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,560
 thinking, oh, that was nice, but I'm done.

639
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,520
 I'm never reading another one.

640
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,440
 It won the Kitchees Red Tentacle, I believe this year.

641
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,120
 And they're usually a sort of interesting read.

642
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,160
 Excellent.

643
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,760
 One day, I will know what the Kitchees are, but today is not that day.

644
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,600
 We should discuss it on a future episode because I just hear people talking about

645
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,240
 it, but I've never really investigated it.

646
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,760
 I'm sure the same is true for some of our listeners.

647
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,080
 So maybe we should have our in the future.

648
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,360
 I'm going to pick Asteroid City by Wes Anderson.

649
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,400
 Very good movie.

650
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,720
 I went to see Asteroid City the other day.

651
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,760
 I don't know if it's genre.

652
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,720
 I think it might be, but I also think it might not be.

653
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
 I think it depends how you think of it.

654
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,480
 It reminds me a lot of the Gran Butte Pest Hotel, which also by Wes Anderson.

655
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,920
 I think I enjoyed Gran Butte Pest slightly more, but it's very close.

656
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:01,800
 Asteroid City is probably dealing with very similar themes, but I think is much more

657
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,640
 optimistic than the Gran Butte Pest Hotel is.

658
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,880
 It deals more with filmmaking and storytelling than Gran Butte Pest does,

659
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,960
 even though Gran Butte Pest does deal with storytelling, like in its structure.

660
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,240
 It deals with a lot of the same themes as a Christopher Nolan work, but I liked it.

661
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,600
 And Jeff Goldblum is amazing.

662
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,200
 Highly recommend you can't see it in the cinema, if possible.

663
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,640
 Tom Hanks is amazing as well.

664
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,400
 I could just list all of the actors.

665
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,960
 If only I had a cinema.

666
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,760
 I'm going to say this every two weeks until the end of time now.

667
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,760
 That was the Thought Podcast.

668
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,120
 And it's a goodbye from me.

669
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,400
 It's goodbye from me.

670
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,440
 It's goodbye from me.

671
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:57,560
 [Music]

672
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,400
 Oh, Liz, can we wish you a happy birthday on the podcast?

673
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,480
 I mean, you can meet me.

674
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,240
 And can we tell people how old you are?

675
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,160
 Yes.

676
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,560
 When's your birthday, Liz?

677
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,760
 How do I not know this?

678
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,480
 My birthday was two and a half weeks ago.

679
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,280
 Yes.

680
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,080
 And Liz is now the age of 40 years old.

681
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,760
 A round number.

682
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,560
 I am.

683
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,920
 [Music]

684
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,480
 And that means in two years, she's going to have a massive party.

685
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,520
 It should be 42.

686
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,400
 Oh, yeah.

687
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,360
 Hmm.

688
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,120
 I'm starting the campaign for everyone in Science Nation,

689
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,000
 found them to have massive parties at 42.

690
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,560
 It's a bit late.

691
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,320
 I'm starting the campaign in the full knowledge that eventually we will

692
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,120
 unearth time travel and people can go back and have red right to parties.

693
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,760
 I mean, John, it also means you get to go to quite a few parties

694
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,960
 before you have to throw a party.

695
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,880
 Mm.

696
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,920
 I like that.

697
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,360
 I might have a I might have a 60th.

698
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,720
 Oh, you better.

699
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,960
 Oh, I'm up for that too.
