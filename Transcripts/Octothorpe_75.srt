1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 Okay John, I am very very sorry, can you work out why I am very very sorry?

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,040
 Have you recorded the first half of the podcast on the wrong microphone?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,680
 Nope, I've recorded it on the right microphone but it was about two foot from my face.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
 So...

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,440
 And so, I'm gonna put this at the start of the podcast and this is gonna function as the apology.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,120
 So when you're wondering why Alison is down a well this week, it wasn't my fault listeners, please don't @ me.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,800
 Okay, it was my fault.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,560
 I will do my best at the edit.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:38,560
 [Music]

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:47,120
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 75th episode of Octothorpe, the podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,640
 which is coming to you on the 19th of January 2023.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,000
 I'm John Coxon.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,400
 I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,280
 And it has been a while since we all sat down and recorded a proper episode.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,920
 We have some letters of comment.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,440
 Happy New Year everyone.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,960
 Happy New Year.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960
 Happy 2023.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,520
 Happy 2565.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,600
 It's 2565 here. I'm in the future.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,960
 I always forget that but yeah, no, Liz is in the future.

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,920
 [Music]

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,520
 Is it good in the future?

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,240
 Both in terms of the fact that she's ahead of us in time zone and ahead of us in year number.

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
 Have they cured COVID in the future, Liz?

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,840
 No, but I feel I am less likely to get it in 2565 than I did in 2022.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,440
 So we had a letter of comment and it came from Sandra Bond who said,

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,560
 "You've heard of Elf on a Shelf, but are you ready for meeses in fleeces?"

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,840
 Thank you very much, Sandra.

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,400
 10 out of 10 loc, made me guffaw.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,880
 We also heard from someone who is described in the show notes as Chris

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,200
 "the legend" Garcia.

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:01,040
 And Chris "the legend" Garcia wrote in to tell us things.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,880
 He sent it from the Journey Planet email.

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,040
 And in fact, it's not signed Chris Garcia.

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,960
 It's signed John Coxon's soulmate.

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,200
 So John, can you confirm unambiguously that that is a letter from Christopher

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,760
 J Garcia?

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,520
 Having read it, yes, I can say that it is a lock from Christopher J Garcia.

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,560
 But yes, he is my soulmate and he does say that he loves graphs or (dare he hope) charts.

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,800
 What's the difference between a graph and a chart, Liz?

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,520
 I don't know John.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
 Why is the difference between a graph and a chart?

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,240
 Well, a graph is a thing that you use to show the visualization of data

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,480
 and a chart is a thing a pirate uses.

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:48,000
 Arrr. To visualise data. Yeah. Obviously. He says that he was kind of bummed that Providence didn't get Smofcon.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,600
 He really enjoys Providence, especially when they host WrestleMania.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,840
 Raj on Twitter.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,160
 He says, loc for number 73: graphs!

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,800
 Hurrah!

51
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,360
 Unfortunately, I can't remember why I wanted graphs now.

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,960
 And then those graphs are pretty interesting.

53
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,240
 I hope the fan categories get more love and then bean dice?

54
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,040
 Ew.

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,400
 No, the bean dice are great.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,080
 And then he's not read any Stephen King except maybe the odd short story,

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
 but he doesn't like horror.

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,440
 And so yeah, Stephen King has two modes.

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,320
 And when I've been listening to people talking about King's most recent book,

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,880
 a lot of them have been kind of distinguishing between King the horror writer and King the fantasy

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,520
 writer.

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,400
 My understanding is that he's very talented in both modes.

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
 I have not read any of his fantasy mode.

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,920
 I basically imagine him a bit like Optimus Prime, but for books.

65
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,920
 I mean, it's fantasy is mostly, it's mostly Dark Tower, I guess.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
 Which I haven't read, I think is most recent one.

67
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,640
 Yeah, it's as similar as I guess you might say with fantasy,

68
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,840
 but I primarily read the horror wands.

69
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,880
 Oh, well, I've read the stand, which is, you know, kind of post-apocalyptic science fiction in a way.

70
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,000
 Post-apocalyptic fantasy?

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,400
 I don't know.

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,520
 I mean, there's a play.

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,240
 Yes.

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,280
 11/22/63 is science fiction.

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,760
 But no fairytale is the one I'm thinking of, which came out in 2022 and is very much in his fantasy

76
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,320
 oeuvre rather than his horror oeuvre.

77
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,160
 Let's continue. This is a boring digression.

78
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,240
 Raj and Hugo Girl also sent us a flurry of mentions on Twitter,

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,000
 which Liz will now summarize.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,800
 Yes. So they were discussing a previous episode of Hugo Girl, which was their one about

81
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
 Callocaine.

82
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,800
 And basically to summarize it, Raj told the Hugo Girl team that if they're coming over to Glasgow

83
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
 for Worldcon, they need to try it iron brew, which is correct.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,880
 Yep, true.

85
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:39,600
 And this has spiralled into possibly a sort of American versus British food tasting item at Glasgow.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,920
 So if you want to suggest anything that should be included in this episode,

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,120
 you probably have about a year and a half realistically to suggest them.

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,920
 But I do think that if they come to Glasgow, we will be making them have iron brew and maybe

89
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,960
 deep-fried Mars bar?

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,080
 Deep-fried Mars bar? Yep.

91
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,960
 Haggis.

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,640
 Oh, deep-fried Mars bar.

93
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,120
 Yeah.

94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,720
 I really like deep-fried Mars bar.

95
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
 I also like deep-fried Mars bar.

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,920
 Deep-fried Mars bars are great, is why.

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,360
 Quite hard to get Haggis in the United States because of food safety law.

98
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,960
 Laurie and Kevin are vegetarian and vegetarian Haggis is easier to get because vegetables are

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,200
 less dangerous. You heard it here first.

100
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
 But vegetarian Haggis is also very nice.

101
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,280
 I mean, basically it's the spice mix that makes Haggis nice and you can put that in pretty much

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
 any edible food.

103
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,160
 So, um...

104
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,280
 I would concur that vegetarian Haggis is not a pale limitation of meat-based Haggis.

105
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,880
 It is almost identical and doesn't have weird bits of sheep in it.

106
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,800
 So, you know, that's quite good, isn't it?

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,040
 So Kevin Stanley wrote to us to say you had difficulty finding information about

108
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,600
 smofcon and I had put all of the smofcon big presentations in a video on the...

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
 on YouTube, on the smofcon 38 YouTube channel.

110
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,160
 And it is fair to say that we didn't go hunting out videos,

111
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,160
 though we might have done a few people to link to them. But, um, we don't really like long videos

112
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,640
 of the base in presentations as a mechanism for acquiring information because it is very slow.

113
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,800
 And we would prefer to get nice, tight news reports.

114
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,960
 So, you know, South friction journalists do your bit.

115
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,360
 What we don't like is when in order to get the information you have to listen to one or more

116
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,200
 people blather on instead of just being able to read it nice and concisely off a webpage.

117
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
 Oh no, wait.

118
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,040
 We do put links in our show notes to be fair.

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,160
 Yeah, we do. No, and I would also say,

120
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,200
 I think smofcon, as a convention full of people who run conventions,

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,120
 should in many ways be modelling best convention running behaviour.

122
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,840
 And I will leave the rest of that sentence as an exercise for the reader.

123
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,960
 Have you ever heard the proverb about cobblers children?

124
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,240
 No, I'd haven't.

125
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,480
 Um, it's about cobblers children and not having shoes.

126
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,880
 Yeah, and I'd say the floor here is that, I mean, one thing about YouTube videos is

127
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,240
 they're not very indexable in searches.

128
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,720
 So when I went searching for stuff about smofcon 40 bid sessions,

129
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
 I didn't find the videos basically.

130
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
 No, and it is interesting.

131
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,200
 Like, even if Kevin or, well, not Kevin, it's not going to stop necessarily.

132
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,360
 But even if someone had sent that to far 770 and far some 70 had literally just linked it,

133
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
 saying here is the video, I would have found it then.

134
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,640
 It's basically a problem with linking as much as it is a problem with anything else.

135
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,600
 Like, if you have information, put it in lots of places,

136
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,520
 because then you maximise the chance of people finding it.

137
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,680
 Kevin does note something interesting, which was that the vote was not obviously split,

138
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,160
 kind of US versus rest of world.

139
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,280
 There are clearly US and Canadian attendees who voted for Sweden and vice versa.

140
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,560
 He basically says that getting to providence from large parts of the US is a little bit of a pain,

141
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,640
 because it's really far in the corner.

142
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,400
 And I guess it's not a big airport.

143
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,920
 So he notes that from where he lives in northern Nevada,

144
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,440
 it's almost as complicated for him to travel to providence as to Stockholm.

145
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,840
 And that is also a fair comment.

146
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,040
 Do you still want to go to both?

147
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,160
 I've been to Stockholm.

148
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,040
 Want to go to providence?

149
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,120
 I mean, Northern Nevada is one of the remotest places on the planet.

150
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,320
 You might as well send from the depths of the Amazonian jungle.

151
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,560
 It is the earliest part of getting stuck over to get to providence.

152
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,320
 I've been to Nevada and I've not been to the Amazonian jungle.

153
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,200
 So one day I hope to get to the Amazonian jungle, I suppose is the point.

154
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,680
 And then we had another lock, which is from Dave Mansfield.

155
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,320
 Dave did some great AI beer recipes, one for each of us,

156
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,400
 and then one that combined elements of each of the three together.

157
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,320
 I won't read them out, but I will put a link in the show notes to Dave's tweet.

158
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,680
 What was the tweet you wanted?

159
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,040
 No, it's a letter.

160
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,800
 Oh, no, shit, it was an email.

161
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,840
 Basically listeners, just imagine a great email.

162
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,320
 What I like is that they look as a non-brewer.

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,960
 They look like they are plausible beer recipes,

164
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,360
 but the one for me suggests that you make the beer,

165
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,400
 and then you mix it basically equal parts beer,

166
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,680
 sweetened condensed milk, and I had a bag of Thai iced tea ricks.

167
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,280
 And listeners, I don't think this is a drink I can recommend.

168
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,880
 But if anyone wants to try it, I'll bring you a bag of Thai iced tea mix.

169
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,600
 How about that?

170
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,960
 Yeah, I assume that, you know, Dave will brew all three of these in time for Glasgow

171
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,600
 in 2024, and we'll have them on the pot.

172
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,840
 Kurt Phillips wrote to us, so Kurt was the only person who mentioned the poem,

173
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
 and he didn't mention the poem, but he mentioned the picture,

174
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,120
 and said, "Why is, why is Greg Thulu behind bars when John Cox said he's on the loose?"

175
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,680
 And I think that's a fair question for you, really.

176
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
 But it's all a matter of perspective.

177
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,320
 I did enjoy reading Sandra's poem on the podcast.

178
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,720
 I also enjoyed finding out from Alison's reading of the poem

179
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
 the pronunciation of the word jibber.

180
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
 That is how you say jibber, is it not?

181
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,760
 I think so.

182
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,480
 I was trying to channel Stanley Holloway,

183
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,760
 and I am not very good at it for anyone who was confused by a poem.

184
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,440
 It is a pastiche of the Larnard Albert.

185
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,360
 The Larnard Albert is the most famous monologue written by Merit Edgar,

186
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
 and was made famous by Stanley Holloway.

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,360
 And we'll put a link to a YouTube video in the show next,

188
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,200
 so you can see how it's meant to be said.

189
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,000
 Duncan McGregor also got in touch to say that he has not yet finished his Christmas pastiche

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
 due to work, so it might need to wait till next Christmas.

191
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
 And it's always good to have a bank of forthcoming Christmas pastiche's.

192
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
 Do write in next year, Duncan.

193
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,040
 Obviously, feel free to write in before that as well.

194
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,920
 Either Lillian Edwards or a chatbot doing an extremely good impersonation of Lillian Edwards

195
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,280
 wrote to say, "Oh damn, I meant to do something about that poem business,"

196
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,080
 which is about as perfect a summation of a Lillian Edwards lock as you could hope to get.

197
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,760
 We've got a couple of sort of follow-outs or follow-ins or whatever you want to call them,

198
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,480
 about our discussion on semi-prozines from a few weeks ago.

199
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,720
 So firstly to note that the Locust fundraiser is doing well.

200
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
 I mean, I think we discussed the Locust fundraiser,

201
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,960
 but I think our discussion was less about whether we thought Locust would make its target

202
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,120
 and more about whether we thought like the Locust model was sustainable.

203
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,200
 But they made their target.

204
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,720
 It's very difficult for me to tell because Indiegogo likes to convert everything into your local

205
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,360
 currency and I cannot do the back conversion in my head.

206
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:39,360
 They have made $92,485 out of a requested $91,978.

207
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,720
 Hang on, that seemed weird.

208
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,000
 Oh, I see, but it also says there's a $75,000 goal.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,920
 So I think they've added a stretch goal if they get there.

210
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,400
 Yeah, I mean, this is good because it means that there will be Locusts for at least another year.

211
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,680
 But they do, they have stretch goals, which are basically, if you give us more money,

212
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,800
 you'll get kind of some special issues and things, which is interesting because it basically

213
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,520
 means if they hit their stretch goals, they have to put out even more issues,

214
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,440
 which presumably they also have to print and so on and pay more contributors for.

215
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
 Ends up giving them basically even more work.

216
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,480
 It's interesting to see how that's going to work.

217
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,480
 One of the things that is clear, or one of the things that I know from having followed a lot of

218
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,080
 board game kickstarters and kickstarters in general, most of the tabletop kickstarters,

219
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,920
 is that doing those stretch goals that require you to do lots of extra work is kind of a trap

220
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,280
 because quite often what ends up happening is you in no way accurately reflect the cost of doing

221
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,320
 the extra work in the extra amount you got from the stretch goal.

222
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,280
 So I'm a little bit surprised that they did stretch goals.

223
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,840
 It seems like quite a fundraising 101 thing that you might be like,

224
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,760
 actually, let's just get the money we need.

225
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,920
 And then let's worry about stretch goals next time.

226
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,720
 I guess it is a very common thing in, for instance, the semi-prozine kickstarters, all right?

227
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,080
 Whenever you have one for, you know, uncanny or strange rather than something,

228
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,520
 it's quite common for there to be a stretch goal, which is we will do this special issue.

229
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,840
 So maybe it's just kind of conforming to what backers expect.

230
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,200
 Maybe, yeah, could well be, that is a good point.

231
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,640
 Shall I do a segue?

232
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,920
 You could segue.

233
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,880
 Because segue's nicely into the next topic, which is over the kind of holiday period,

234
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,280
 Amazon announced they were stopping doing magazine subscriptions through Kindle,

235
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,960
 which is potentially a big hit to quite a lot of magazines who have a lot of subscribers through

236
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,120
 Kindle. And it was interesting that the editor of Uncanny, one of the witnesses of Uncanny,

237
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,240
 Michael Thomas, pulled out the numbers of people who were supporting kickstarters for different

238
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,520
 semi-prozines, which all come in at basically about 400 to 1000 backers, I think,

239
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,760
 locus and out about 1,165 backers. But he's saying that is a relatively small number of people

240
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,920
 compared to, say, Amazon's an analog, which apparently have about 10,000 subscribers through

241
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:59,120
 Kindle periodical. So it could be, there is this kind of core of maybe 2,000, 3,000 people who

242
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,640
 were supporting a lot of these kickstarters, and they're exactly the people that locus kind of

243
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,520
 were appealing to, and have gone for the thing you kind of expect to see on a magazine kickstarter.

244
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,480
 But then it's kind of how can you expand that to a wider audience? And obviously the Kindle

245
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,800
 periodical was a way of getting maybe a completely different set of people to subscribe to you on

246
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,600
 a different platform, and that is now, now gone. It's going to be interesting to see if that has

247
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,360
 any effect on sort of the finances and the income of these magazines.

248
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:33,280
 It sort of reminds me a lot of the discussions that were had around sustainability, not from a

249
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,760
 profit perspective, but from a reader perspective when Google Reader went away, because a lot of

250
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,920
 people were like, "Oh, we should not have relied so heavily on Google to do this because now a lot

251
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,560
 of our readers have gone away." And I think a lot of the magazines are going to be like, "Oh,

252
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,680
 we should not have relied so heavily on Amazon to do this because now a lot of our readers are

253
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:55,280
 going to go away." So my professional advice here would be if you are reliant on a single platform

254
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,360
 for more than about a third of your income, you probably need to have diversification on your

255
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,720
 forward plan fairly quickly, because this happens all the time. You know,

256
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,240
 bits of platforms that you rely on stop doing the thing you were making money with all of the time.

257
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:20,320
 And it goes double for Amazon, because Amazon, some platforms quite care about their creators,

258
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,080
 but Amazon really doesn't give us stuff about you.

259
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,200
 This ties into a lot of the reasons why I make sure there are always non-Amazon links in the show

260
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:37,440
 notes every episode, because I don't think we are currently as readers very reliant on Amazon,

261
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,840
 and that seems in the long term to be a fool's errand to me.

262
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,160
 Yeah, and I'm not going to criticize everything magazines for being too reliant on one or the

263
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,120
 other, just that obviously, or on kind of leg of the stool got kicked out over Christmas,

264
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
 and it's going to be interesting to see if there's a way of replacing that. You know,

265
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,240
 does something else pop up where you can subscribe to magazines through it. You can do it through,

266
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,920
 say, weightless books website, but obviously there's like a much kind of bigger gap of getting

267
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,360
 people to go into weightless books and register for that, and buy the subscriptions and set them

268
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,200
 to email to you, and so on. There is to just like clicking a button on the Amazon website,

269
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:24,080
 and it pops up on your Kindle.

270
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:33,040
 Chengdu! Liz, do you want to go into Chengdu? Chengdu! Chengdu! We have talked about the Chengdu

271
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,520
 WorldCon before. We're going to talk about Chengdu WorldCon again, because it is getting increasingly

272
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,760
 close to the time of the Chengdu WorldCon, and like nothing is happening and no one knows what's

273
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:54,160
 going on. So a brief digression into Wispers Constitution mode. Thank you, John. There

274
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,080
 aren't many deadlines in the Wispers Constitution, but there are a couple, and one of them is that

275
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,720
 you have to be a member of the WorldCon by the end of January in order to nominate. So it'll be

276
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,200
 being a member of Chengdu, or being a member of Chengdu, because they get nomination rights from

277
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,280
 the beginning of the year. So basically, it is pretty important that you are able to actually

278
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,600
 join the convention by January 31st, if you'd like to be able to nominate. And it seems that you can

279
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,040
 now join Chengdu, although I haven't tested it because I have a full membership by voting at

280
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,400
 Discord, and I think John and Alison do as well. So I'm not sure any of us have actually tested

281
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,840
 this, but it does appear that Chengdu have had an awful time trying to set up credit card payments,

282
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,240
 essentially because like the credit card systems and the systems used in China are not well

283
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,080
 integrated with the systems used in the rest of the world. And I would assume setting up a bank

284
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,520
 account in China to take credit card payments from overseas is not a trivial job. But the outcome

285
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,080
 of this is if you would like to nominate in the Hugo's and you do not currently have a supporting

286
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,000
 membership, you'll have to try and join. And then I think do a direct bank transfer to someone and

287
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,680
 send the receipt to them, and they will check over and then give you a membership, which probably works,

288
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,520
 but I don't know like where the bank is that you have to transfer money to. I don't know

289
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,160
 whether it's your costs involved with this. Basically listeners, if any of you have tried it,

290
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,920
 let us know because I'd be interested to know how it works. But this is one of the things where

291
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,040
 it is currently like, I guess it's fulfilling kind of the requirements of the Constitution,

292
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,680
 which is you can allow people to join. It doesn't say you actually have to allow people to join

293
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:34,640
 easily or without a large international wire transfer markup or anything like that. And so

294
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,640
 it's going to be interesting to see if anyone, you know, does try and change the Constitution

295
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,560
 to make it so that, you know, you not only have to allow people to join, but allow people to join

296
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,440
 relatively easily. Now the counterpoint to that might be, I have no idea how easy it's been for

297
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,240
 anyone in China to become a supporting member of Worldcons for like the past 15 years, possibly

298
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,560
 also extremely difficult. But it doesn't seem ideal that this is your solution when you're getting

299
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,400
 very close to a deadline. And there's just like, there's a sort of the hand done, like, I don't

300
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,840
 think I've actually had any emails from the Chengdu, Worldcon, even though I am a member. We haven't

301
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
 got any progress reports. There is another petition against their guest of honor,

302
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,760
 Sergei Lukianenko, who we'll link to in the show notes.

303
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,120
 Confirmed Rotta Sergei Lukianenko. I feel like we should always introduce him with confirmed

304
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,280
 Rotta in Starwood name, because he's confirmed Rotta letters.

305
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,960
 But yeah, so they are tweeting. And I mean, I can log into their website and see some things and

306
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,040
 click on them. And they are tweeting quite a bit, but not thing particularly relevant to

307
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,960
 say joining the Worldcon. It'd just be nice to see a little bit more activity. Now,

308
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,360
 it has been, I'm sure, extremely hard to deal with the COVID situation. And I'm aware that now

309
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,000
 is also basically a holiday. So I don't know if we're going to hear from anything from them soon,

310
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,640
 but it would be nice to hear a little bit more from them kind of outside the times when they

311
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
 absolutely have to say something like at the, you know, smothcon, vanishing position and so on.

312
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,640
 And this is something that slightly worries me because I am, although I was not a huge fan of

313
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,760
 China's bid specifically, I am in general a huge fan of countries bidding to host Worldcon's

314
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,640
 that are not the usual suspects. But I do worry that part of the problem with having a convention

315
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,800
 do a bad job of that when they do it, as Chengdu currently are, is that it sours the

316
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,040
 pot for sort of future people trying to do the same thing. Like every international

317
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,480
 Worldcon that is a complete shower hurts the chance that we'll get more international

318
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,440
 Worldcons in the future. And I don't like it when that happens. And it's not fair that it happens,

319
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,160
 but it is true, I think. But I will say, like, given that it is a Chinese holiday at the moment,

320
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,200
 or coming up very soon with Chinese New Year, they did need to make sure they had all their ducks

321
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,200
 in a row before that happened. And they very clearly did not make sure they had their ducks in a row,

322
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,960
 which is pain in the butt. Yeah, because nothing is going to happen during Chinese New Year at all,

323
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,080
 so which if case anyone doesn't know, it's quite a long holiday, a couple of weeks. And it's normally

324
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,960
 a couple of weeks, but a bit of travel. So it takes people a bit of a while to get back into the

325
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,160
 swing of things afterwards as well, typically. So when, as I haven't checked, I'm just talking

326
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,760
 out of my hat here, but I do wonder if when they say, oh, people have to make a direct payment to

327
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,640
 a bank account, that means a direct payment to a US bank account, thereby disenfranchising everyone

328
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,240
 who is not in the US or China. But I don't know, somebody, people who do know, write in.

329
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,680
 Yeah, I mean, it's not insurmountable to make a direct bank transfer to a US account from the UK.

330
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,320
 It's just bloody expensive. Yeah, I mean, there are websites that will allow you to do it for minimal

331
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,520
 costs and so on, but it's like an, it's just an extra hoop to jump through. I mean, I will say that

332
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,840
 I pay for a lot of things in Thailand by direct bank transfer, like a lot more than ever used to

333
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,880
 the UK, because really easy to do. So they may have been thinking, well, we do direct bank transfers

334
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,800
 to each other a lot. Let's just set one up so people can do a direct bank transfer to the other

335
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,280
 person. I can't test it out because I can't kind of get in and do it without buying a membership,

336
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,680
 basically, which I do not want to do because I've already got one listeners, we are guinea pigs.

337
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,120
 Yeah, it's also tricky, because all of the things we just said assume that they are,

338
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,720
 I think we're Chinese people who are like, well, maybe it works fine for us if we do it like that.

339
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,720
 So maybe it will work fine for everyone else. But like, I have a question, which is,

340
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,440
 Ben Yalu is the co-chair, and there are other non-Chinese fans involved with this world gone.

341
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,640
 And my question to those fans is, what are you doing? They're trying to touch Chinese people.

342
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,400
 I mean, it's difficult from the outside. It might be that they're all doing exactly what

343
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,400
 they're supposed to be doing. And it's all on the Chinese fans who are involved being horrible

344
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,960
 at communicating that means that they're not. And I mean, I don't even care if it is a formal

345
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,040
 PR1, to be honest. You could just put a blog post up, title PR1. But it needs to include things like,

346
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:58,560
 when we expect to do stuff, like let you be able to buy a membership or open hotel bookings, or even,

347
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,160
 you know, put an informational page up about what you might need to do to get a visa if that's

348
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,520
 even going to be possible, that kind of thing. Because this is a time frame when if people were

349
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,760
 going to go, they would be thinking about planning their trips. And possibly they are not so bothered

350
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,400
 about getting anyone from overseas. But if you don't get anyone from overseas, then I don't really

351
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,320
 see the point in having the world come up with just a Chinese science fiction convention, which

352
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,520
 would probably be a lot easier to administer for them. And you wouldn't have to muck about with all

353
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,640
 this constitutional stuff. It's a mess. Yarrr. But there's still time to fix things. So it's not

354
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,720
 like an irreneumable mess. Yeah, it's just a mess where we're saying, yeah, it's probably time that

355
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,360
 you started doing a few of these things. And hopefully they will buy that in mind. You know,

356
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,680
 when they're listening to us, fountains of all, fanish knowledge.

357
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,400
 [laughs]

358
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,880
 Yup.

359
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,920
 But yeah, it just, it frustrates me greatly, because I would quite like, I would like things to be

360
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,640
 different. I'd like it to be a really good Wilcon. And then like, there might be more in

361
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,560
 non-traditional Wilcon places. But it's probably not going to be. So...

362
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:05,120
 Nope. So bear in mind that China at the moment can get the Wilcon anytime it wants. So, you know,

363
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,880
 it just might not want it. But I think you are wrong in so far as if this is a huge and

364
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,160
 shambolic mess, the Wussfish Constitution will be modified to make sure that it is harder

365
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,120
 for China to win in the way it did last time. And do you have any suggestions for that modification,

366
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,160
 John? Siggly, sickly. Well, though, I mean, firstly, I think there will be modifications,

367
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,920
 stuff like you have to have your own email address in your own address. But the other thing I did

368
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,040
 wonder was whether it was worth or whether anyone would propose an amendment to the Wussfish

369
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:41,760
 Constitution. So there is 4.6.1. And I'm taking advantage of the Liz Bat's work here, because I

370
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,480
 believe Liz posted this in a chat I was having elsewhere and I copied and pasted it into the

371
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,880
 show notes. So this is Liz's research. So for what this one one basically says that any convention

372
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,280
 that wants to be eligible for site selection has to do three things. They have to file documents

373
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,560
 that say that they are intending to bid, they have to have evidence of an agreement with the

374
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,200
 facilities such as a conditional contract, and they have to have rules under which their committee

375
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,640
 will operate, including stuff like replacing officers and so forth. And I wondered whether

376
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,160
 it would be possible to introduce a fourth thing where you have to be able to take card payments

377
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:25,200
 to let people join. You have to show that you can do that, because I don't think it's good, as Liz

378
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,480
 said earlier. I don't think it's good for the world con if world cons who are not in

379
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,800
 traditionally world con hosting countries end up not being able to have anyone from the

380
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,400
 wider world con community attend, because that just seems like it's siloing in a different way,

381
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,040
 which I don't think is all that healthy. But yeah, there are arguments for and against probably.

382
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:50,320
 There are lots of places where credit card use is very is quite uncommon, including quite a lot

383
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,320
 places that you might have thought that credit card use was relatively common and some places in

384
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:06,400
 which you might think a welcome might happen. I'd be concerned that we don't go for a solution

385
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,040
 that has the effect of disenfranchising some countries where credit card uses uncommon.

386
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,000
 I think some of the Eastern European country, I mean, I'm probably talking politics again.

387
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,040
 But I think we've got to have a balance here, which is I want to make it so that people can

388
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,000
 join easily. But I also don't want to put the barriers up for potential bids so high that they

389
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,160
 can't meet them if there might be an alternative. I'm thinking of say the proposed Ugandan bid,

390
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,720
 who might find it difficult to get, you know, be able to take credit card payments from people

391
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,400
 from the US, but they may be able to have an alternative like possibly take them through

392
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,440
 PayPal or take bank transfers and have a local agent or something similar. And the reason is also

393
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,080
 that, you know, it's possible that some of these places like China will have to bid several times

394
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,680
 and I don't want them kind of out of the running of being able to kind of dip their toes in the

395
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,320
 water and bid if they have to also be able to demonstrate that their kind of credit card infrastructure

396
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,920
 is up and running before they start. So maybe if you said a mechanism to take payments worldwide.

397
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,880
 Well, from that perspective, China's got one. You can wire transfer to the states. So that's fine.

398
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,920
 And they've already met that. But not at the point where they bid. And this is suggesting we have a

399
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,920
 little extra hoop at the bidding stage at the paper filing stage, which has traditionally been

400
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:30,320
 kept very minimal where possible. But if the reason we want to make that change is because

401
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,600
 it's very difficult to join China, making it a change that would not make it any easier to join

402
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,960
 China seems daft to me. Might as well just not change it. Because you argued earlier in this very

403
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,800
 episode that wire transfers to a US bank account were also exclusionary for large numbers of the

404
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:53,280
 world's population. I think I may just be saying that the convention has to absorb the transfer costs.

405
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:00,160
 So they need to bundle in transfer costs for global for global payments into their convention,

406
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,960
 design and budgeting. No, because like, I don't know much about the finances of like

407
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,680
 conventions in less well off countries. But I imagine that they need lower budgets and asking them to

408
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,120
 spend large amounts of their budget that US world cons don't have to spend on that seems very unfair

409
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,000
 from an exclusion perspective. The thing is, I can't think of a way of doing this that isn't

410
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,640
 massively disenfranchising. And so I think you have to ask a question, is this a big enough problem

411
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,960
 that it's worth the risk that it is disenfranchising, which it may or may not be, I don't know.

412
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,640
 And then you have to ask the question, like, how do we do this in the easiest possible way

413
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,680
 that disenfranchises the fewest people? And I think the more you tie yourself into not trying to

414
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,800
 avoid disenfranchising people, my worry is the more you risk doing it. I'd be quite happy if

415
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,680
 Chengdu had just said to try con, can you keep your credit card payments open for a little bit

416
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,640
 and take some memberships for us, please? Or even to Glasgow? I don't know. I don't see a reason why

417
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,040
 Chengdu couldn't say to Glasgow, do you mind taking memberships for us and give us the money?

418
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,200
 Is there a reason why not? I think getting the money into China might be the issue, but I don't know.

419
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,080
 But I don't see how that's not a problem with wire transferring to an agent in the US.

420
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,320
 We don't know if it's a wire transfer trade in the US, I'll just say we were speculating. It might

421
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,720
 be that actually when you do the wire transfer on this site, you wire transfer to a Chinese bank account.

422
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,520
 So we all speculate a bit there. Oh, I see what you mean. I did read, I'm sure I read somewhere

423
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,240
 that it was an agent in the US, but I can't find a source for it. So do write in if you know

424
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,200
 listeners. But also, but also, I think the thing is, I don't know if I think that doing memberships

425
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,600
 the way Chengdu are doing it is not exclusionary. Yeah, they're planning to open a corporation in

426
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,680
 Wyoming. So I think that answers quite a lot of those questions. And they should have done that

427
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,360
 in 2021. And it is tricky because I don't know how you square the circle, as Liz says, of making

428
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 it difficult for bids to bid. But I was going on a notion of most bids wanting to be able to take

429
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,120
 pre support. I appreciate that wasn't true for China because they don't need the money. I'd be

430
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,280
 interested to know what listeners think right in, let me know if I'm being hugely unreasonable.

431
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,600
 Let me know if I'm not. Let me know if let me know what you reckon. I'm sure we're going to talk

432
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:22,960
 about Chengdu a few more times before the summer. But one thing that has emerged is that I think

433
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,240
 they were expecting almost of the entire cost of the convention to be picked up by sponsorship deals.

434
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,120
 And I don't think they've actually got those sponsorship deals yet. So I am. I am watching

435
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,280
 fascinatedly to see what happens there. So I think that's all we have to say about Chengdu. Is

436
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,360
 that all we have to say about Chengdu? For this week. Well, we said we said quite a lot. So

437
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,000
 we know I mean that is true. We said quite a lot. And basically you did not come to any strong

438
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,400
 conclusions because I think we are balancing the two things of, you know, it should be easy for

439
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,800
 people to join your convention foreign country. And we shouldn't make you jump through a lot of

440
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,080
 very expensive hoops. Yeah, it is a genuinely difficult. I want there to be a solution. I have

441
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,800
 no idea what that solution is. So this is right in. Yes.

442
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:22,800
 Liz is going to do the Run Along Wombl TBR challenge and we'll mention it here for accountability. Liz.

443
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,520
 Thank you, John, for reading out what I put in the show notes.

444
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:35,520
 Basically, the Run Along Wombl blog has a challenge to tackle your, you know, to be read pile in 2023,

445
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,520
 which is basically a different suggestion for every month in 2023 of how you might read some

446
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,680
 of those books that you always buy and then never get around to reading. And I have quite a few of

447
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,440
 those. So I thought I might give it a go. So my January, my January project is to read the most

448
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,880
 recent book on my TBR pile, which I will get around to eventually, but it's a paper book. So it's

449
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,480
 taking me a bit longer than usual. And then for every month, there's like a stretch goal. And the

450
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,280
 stretch goal is to read the oldest book. And the other thing I quite like is February. It suggests

451
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,400
 that you read 28 short stories, which would work quite well for preparing for Hugo nominations,

452
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,160
 assuming the Hugo nominations actually happen and so on. And so I thought I might try following it.

453
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,720
 And I thought if I mention it here, then someone might remind me at, you know, intervals throughout

454
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,720
 the year that I plan to do this and see if I've actually done any of it. So you heard it here

455
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,960
 first, listeners. No, it's a good, it's a good idea. I did on the subject of the stretch goal,

456
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,720
 I did see someone in a chat, I'm in, say it's bold of them to assume that I know what the oldest book

457
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,840
 on my TBR pile is. And obviously the solution there is to clear your current TBR pile before

458
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,520
 starting the challenge. So you do have good data. It doesn't really matter, does it? I mean,

459
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,320
 it's in the spirit of things like if I read, Oh, the third oldest book on my TBR pile, who cares?

460
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,560
 Some people would, I do not, but actually what I'm doing is I'm reading the book I can find

461
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,200
 my, the earliest book in my Kindle purchasing history that I haven't read, which I think is from 2017.

462
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,200
 So yeah, might read that. I'm going to, I'm still decluttering. And one of the things I am decluttering

463
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,280
 is almost all the books we own on paper that are, that just have text in them, that we are keeping

464
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,720
 a few, but very, very few. But I am going to offer an alternative stretch goal, which is to look at

465
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,480
 your oldest TBR book, conclusion never going to read it and delete it and then continue with this

466
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,680
 process until you get to one that you actually fancy reading and then read that one. Because I

467
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,120
 think there's a whole thing about the way in which having a very large number of books you haven't

468
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,320
 read, particularly paper ones, weighs your mind down. There are plenty of new books to read guys,

469
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,040
 only keep the old books if you really still want to read them. Don't fall foul of the sunk

470
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,320
 cost fallacy. Why, why we don't need a book that I've already bought? I have this with steam.

471
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,840
 I have so many steam games that I've got in bundles that I'm never ever going to play. I wish

472
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,920
 there was a good way of just being like, I don't want this anymore, get rid of it. But every time I

473
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,480
 am like, because I can't sell it for like, if I could sell it for a penny, mentally, but like

474
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,160
 brilliant, that's good. But just deleting it feels wrong. Like, no, I own this, deleting it will be

475
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,640
 wasteful. And so there is a real like tension there, but it stresses me out that I've got all

476
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:19,200
 these games in steam. I mean, also listeners, I did my 2022 steam end of year stats and steam

477
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,920
 says I played one game and that game was tabletop simulator. So I think it's time to conclude that

478
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,720
 maybe I just don't play games on PC anymore. That phase of my life has passed. Yeah, so I kind of get

479
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,840
 both points. I would like to say two further things. One is that obviously I don't actually own my

480
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,840
 books because they're on my Kindle. So technically Amazon owns them and could delete them at any time.

481
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,840
 And the other thing says, when I said 2017, I didn't mean 2017 at all. I meant 2011.

482
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,640
 Oh, oh, that is that is a delightful little coder. I love it. For those who are following along at home,

483
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:01,840
 I was just finishing my undergraduate degree in 2011. I expect Liz, you were finishing your PhD?

484
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,080
 Yeah, just finished it. So of course, it didn't read anything during my undergraduate degree or

485
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,040
 my PhD that I started reading in. I think I found that my undergraduate and PhD did do a number for

486
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,480
 my leisure reading as well. My youngest child had just started secondary school and all you think

487
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,000
 people who think that a PhD does a number on your reading habits, you should try having children.

488
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Oh my god. So no, it sounds like a good ploy, Liz. I'm kind of trying to do something similar

489
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,320
 with board games, not as a result of this challenge, but the board game app I use to log my board

490
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,560
 game plays has so it has like a challenges expansion you can buy in app and you set yourself challenges

491
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,400
 and they've recently announced a new type of challenge, which is you can set a challenge to bring

492
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,120
 your cost per play of each of your board games down to five pounds. And so I have set that up

493
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,840
 basically. So if you spent 60 quid on a board game, you would need to play it 12 times in order

494
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,160
 for each player to of course five pounds. And I set myself the target of doing this by first

495
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,760
 January 2035. And also, I'm not going to worry if I don't like it's basically just for data. I'm not

496
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,400
 actually pushing to try and do it, but it reliably for me, I need to play 287 more games in 717 days.

497
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:22,000
 So that's good. It's got a little graph. Hoorah. John, if you have a game and you know, it costs you

498
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,160
 say 50 pounds and you've played it twice and then you sell it on eBay for 50 pounds, do you get 10

499
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,600
 pounds in credit? No, but I will say if I buy a game, play it once and hate it and then sell it,

500
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,560
 I delete it from the stats completely. So like, you know, I'm making out like a bandit, they're

501
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,200
 worthless. Obviously, there's a solution here, which is to never spend more than a five or on a

502
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,800
 tabletop board game. But I did notice that board games stats has spaces for how much you pay for a

503
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,120
 board game, which I'm trying to fill in. And it doesn't really have a note of how much you

504
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,720
 realize when you get shot of it. So I am trying to buy most games, either cheaply or second-hand.

505
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,360
 And and so that should reduce the cost per play. My New Year's resolution is to get rid of half

506
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:07,280
 of my possessions pretty much in 2023. But we started early, we started in November. Yeah,

507
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,600
 that's a lot. Physical possessions. So I will end up with a very large number of books on

508
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,480
 Kobo. And I think that just means that Rakuten owns them all. I don't think it's any better,

509
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,600
 though I have a kind of bit of a caliber thing going on. So I do have copies of them all that

510
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,040
 Rakuten does not own.

511
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,440
 [Music]

512
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,200
 Should we do picks? Yeah, suppose so. I can go down the pub. Who wants to start?

513
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,080
 I want to start. So like last year, I put a note on my Facebook page. This is a public post,

514
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:48,800
 so we'll link to the show notes saying, "Tell us one good novel written in 2022." And lots of

515
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,000
 people did, and about most of them were written in 2022. I'm going to do another post, which will

516
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,200
 be out by the time you get this saying, "Recomend me one thing that's not a novel that was new in 2022

517
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,760
 that you enjoyed." And so hopefully that will get me a lot of recommendations and things that are

518
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,720
 not novels. In the novels, several people said, "Ah, you should read Cold Water by Dave Hutchinson."

519
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,080
 And I said, "I cannot do that because I haven't read the first four books in the series." And they

520
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,680
 said, "Oh no, you are so wrong about that." So I picked up the first book in his Fractured Europe

521
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,560
 series, which is "European Autumn." And I read it, and I liked it very much indeed. And I'll talk

522
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:34,240
 a little bit about why I liked it, which is that it is a near future spy thriller. And I had just

523
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,560
 read one of these that I didn't like very much at all. So it was quite nice reading one that I

524
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,160
 liked ever such a lot. And the reason is that the balconyization of Europe, it is set in a

525
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:52,480
 Europe which has fallen into lots of little bits as a result of Brexit and not Brexit, but a pandemic

526
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,640
 and the independence of Scotland and all of that sort of stuff. And Hutchinson seems to be

527
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,000
 seems to be quite prescient because he wrote all of this before all of the shenanigans that have

528
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,600
 happened over the last few years. But the book derives a lot of its power and interest from

529
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,600
 the way in which these different little bits of Europe are different, and the way in which

530
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:22,160
 increasing borders everywhere makes life difficult for everybody. And it's all very good and very

531
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,320
 entertaining, but you kind of go, well, as a spy thriller, this is strange because everything here is

532
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,600
 a bit more weird and off-kilter than you would expect if it was a spy thriller, and about 80%

533
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,600
 through of the way through the novel. You discover that something entirely different is also going on.

534
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,360
 So it kind of takes a very dramatic turn to the left. I absolutely loved it. But it was amazing.

535
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:51,680
 And Dave the first time on Wednesday and said, "Ha, your book is amazing. Oh gosh, it's amazing.

536
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,840
 I've met a lot of authors, so I know that if you meet authors and tell them their books are amazing,

537
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,480
 they never mind, and it's true he didn't." So that was very nice. If you're listening, Dave,

538
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,840
 love your book. I also have Europe in autumn on my To Be Red pile. It's one of my older books on

539
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:12,960
 my To Be Red pile. So maybe I should take Liz's Wha ha. One-bling challenge and use it to read that

540
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,480
 other probably not before Easter, because I have reading to before Easter.

541
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,440
 I really liked it. Very much looking forward to the rest, although it's a series. So traditionally,

542
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,160
 I read the second and I'd like them. Yeah, that's okay, but not as nice as the first, and then I read

543
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,000
 the third and go, "Oh no, I'm done with this series now." So I don't know because I've only read the

544
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,400
 first, but the first one's amazing. If you haven't read it, you definitely should. It's very timely

545
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,200
 because it was published in 2015. There's a thing in the TBR challenge about finishing your series

546
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,200
 that you previously started. Did you know, Alison? Oh, I should bet your accountability,

547
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,720
 because I said that on this podcast a year ago, I was going to watch all of the Expanse

548
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,920
 Television show in 2022, and we are nearly all the way through season two. So that went well,

549
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,600
 better than the average New Year's resolution. Very well done, very well done. So only four and

550
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:08,720
 half seasons left to go. I will put a link to, well, assuming Alison is comfortable with me doing this,

551
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:16,400
 I'll put a link to Alison's year in review, exaltation in the show notes, and I will also

552
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,120
 put a link to the Strange Horizons round up of the year, which I read and got some good

553
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,600
 recommendations out of as well. Liz, do you want to go next? Or do you want me to go next?

554
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:34,000
 I can go next, if you like. Hey, do it. I've picked a book which, I don't know, it's maybe not my

555
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,240
 favourite book I read over the holidays, but I thought it was quite interesting and might be

556
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,960
 interested in this. It's a book called A Game of Birds and Wolves by Simon Parkin, who I think

557
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,360
 has previously written quite a lot of stuff about video games, but this is actually about,

558
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:54,400
 it's about the battle for the Atlantic during World War II, which was a battle basically between

559
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,240
 the German U-boats and the merchant shipping that was trying to desperately feed Britain during the

560
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,280
 Second World War. And the bit I was completely unaware of is that there was essentially a unit

561
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,320
 who came up with, it's actually a big board game, that they used to plot out strategies to,

562
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,320
 you know, beat the U-boats quadrants. And so that was interesting and it's got a bit about like the

563
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,840
 history of, you know, war gaming and it's not the first time that war games have been used to

564
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,640
 train people in more time, but this appeared to, you know, be pretty successful. Came up with several

565
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,240
 strategies that were used to even the odds between these merchant convoys and the U-boats. And the

566
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,960
 other interesting thing is that a lot of the participants in this were the Ren's, so the women's

567
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,240
 role-neighful personnel and because a lot of them were involved, essentially in setting up the game

568
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,400
 and in managing it and also ending up becoming very, very skilled at it to the point where you had

569
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,840
 these Ren's playing as submariners against like the captains of Royal Naval ships and beating them,

570
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,360
 essentially because they become so good at kind of the rules of this game. And that is very

571
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,200
 interesting. Unfortunately, it's a little bit underplayed because it's quite clear that,

572
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,520
 basically, not a lot of them wrote memoirs or things like that. And certainly not the same degree

573
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,800
 that kind of high up male Royal Naval personnel were. And so there's some sort of tantalizing things

574
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,520
 where we maybe don't actually know quite enough about what their thoughts were at this time.

575
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,920
 But it sort of blends kind of a high level of view of the battle for the Atlantic,

576
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,080
 the Ren organization, and a few of the specific ones who took part in this, and some of the

577
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,440
 also officers who were doing it because they're the leading officer with someone who couldn't be

578
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,280
 on active service due to illness and disability, but was able to kind of take this part of training

579
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,920
 thousands of ship captains to try and defeat the U-boat tactics. So it's goes great and frustrating

580
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,440
 in that obviously there's a lack of some of the primary sources you really want to be in there,

581
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,320
 and maybe it could go into a bit more detail in places. I kind of wanted more detail on what the

582
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:56,640
 Ren's were always doing in the military, and you'd get quite a bit more about what was documented

583
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,040
 about, say, when they fell in love with Royal Naval Naval Naval so married them because I think

584
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,360
 we've got a bit more documentation on that. But it was a pretty satisfying read, and certainly I had

585
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,600
 no idea there was this board game that was being used to game out tactics against submarines that

586
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:14,880
 seemed to work pretty well. So I recommend it. On the topic of board games, yes, so there's been

587
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,080
 like board gaming in war, and board gaming in defense is really interesting. There's like

588
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:26,000
 been a bunch of stuff on it. There's like a few FBI board games as well that are used to train,

589
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,880
 I'd say FBI or CIA, but one of the one of the federal US agencies still uses them to this day,

590
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,080
 but it's fascinating. Well, that is mentioned in the book actually briefly. He goes to, he's allowed

591
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,880
 to sit in on one of the kind of war gaming exercises that they do at a miniature base and not give any

592
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,920
 details but kind of give like a kind of general overview of it. My experience of playing games

593
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:57,600
 that I used for scenario planning for all sorts, it's not just war actually, games turn out in all

594
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:03,440
 sorts of planning exercises. I don't think that's in any way secret is that they're not fun like

595
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,080
 real games are. It's a bit like fitness games or things like that. As soon as you apply actual

596
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,640
 purpose to the games, they're way less fun than the games we like to play for fun.

597
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:22,160
 I had to think about picks because we haven't recorded for a little while, and I have consumed

598
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:28,240
 media like I've consumed more than one media since last time we got together. And so I had to

599
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:35,200
 consider which one to pick. Obviously I did consider picking the cricket book. I can't remember if

600
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,280
 I've mentioned the cricket book on the podcast. I'm not picking this obviously but if I were to pick

601
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,200
 it, I'd be picking a hit against the spin which is basically quite good because it uses data and

602
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,840
 it has parameter spaces in it. And if you have any interest in data or sport at all, I would

603
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,120
 recommend it. Even if you're not specifically interested in cricket, I think it has enough to

604
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:04,160
 say about data in sport is good. Claire's gonna lend it to me. But in fact I'm gonna pick something

605
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:13,040
 asefnel. I'm gonna pick the Moon Day Letters by Emmy Iteranta, which was given to me by Nick

606
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,080
 Clark and Neil Harrison from The Birthdate. Thank you very much. Peeps and is really good.

607
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:26,720
 It's an odd ten book. You're good. It has more? Yeah. It's about a woman whose spouse is on a

608
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:35,520
 work trip and it's about how that goes. And it's told in the form of her journal over the course of

609
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:42,560
 some time. I'm not quite sure exactly how much time but kind of certainly several months. And

610
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,480
 the setting is effectively the way I put it. So Neil and Neil didn't think I was being

611
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:56,320
 horrendously daft. Was it a bit like a magical realism version of the Expanse? So like it's

612
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:02,000
 kind of a solar system where Earth isn't doing so well and Mars and other colonies are kind of

613
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:10,240
 overtaking it. And the character we follow is from Earth originally and we follow her kind of

614
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,800
 throughout the solar system as it were. And it's really interesting. It's really good. I liked it a

615
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,560
 lot. Neil and Abigail both raved about it and I've seen other people raving about it too.

616
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:26,240
 And that was the old thought podcast and it's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me.

617
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,760
 And it's goodbye from me.

618
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,520
 It's basically what we need to do is we need to develop a convention board game.

619
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:57,120
 Well it's if I ran the zuc on which which we've recommended to you multiple times in the past

620
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,760
 but it's quite dated now. Which I have previously thought actually well there's a new edition which

621
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,880
 I've never played. It's still quite dated. Yeah but I wondered if it was worth getting the updated

622
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,440
 edition and making you and John be convention committees for a podcast one day. How do I play

623
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,000
 if I run the zuc on? Because when you have previously talked about it I have thought it was like

624
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,840
 oh there is this thing. I didn't think it was a recommendation of you should go and find it and

625
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,160
 play it. It's a board game. It's not a recommendation of that and it's not really a board game. It's

626
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:32,240
 like a like a scenario. I am on the board game geek listing. I've been on the board game geek

627
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,160
 listing and in files it says no files found and in overview it says propose official link.

628
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,480
 So it is now on my it's on my want to play and I want to play it make it happen.

629
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,400
 Well you can get it from the nest for press website but I'm not sure if you can I think you can get

630
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,920
 the PDF. Let me check. You probably wanted to have a PDF. I love for a PDF. There was also a

631
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,440
 British version of this. Have you ever played Mystic Wood? No. Okay so Mystic Wood's a classic

632
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,880
 board game and there is a convention version of that called Mystic Con which is kind of like if

633
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,200
 I ran the Zucom but for Britain and also very old. I work Old Avalon Hill game. Yeah I mean the

634
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,280
 the first edition of If I ran the Zucom is 1986 which I'm sure not much has changed

635
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,920
 it aboard con running since 1986. I only played it once at a one of the pre-world con con runner

636
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,240
 things and it was hilarious because we spent a lot more of our money and people points on booze

637
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:37,520
 and were like does this stuff we need a sweet really? Nah. And then you like it basically doesn't

638
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,080
 really work I think for it did it was it was both quite dated and quite American so. So fun fact

639
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:49,440
 I'm now on the nest for press website because like having now realized I can play this I do

640
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,480
 and ironically want to but there's no search function which I feel like if you're running a

641
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,160
 website that sells things you should let people search for them but I can purchase if I ran

642
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:10,560
 the Zucom for $15 in the fourth edition and it is 146 pages. Well I assume what? They used to be a

643
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:17,120
 t-shirt produced by Offworld Designs. Oh well the t-shirt. If anyone's got that t-shirt my address is no

644
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:24,080
 um oh cartoons by Steve Styles. I think we should see if anyone has like if anyone honestly does

645
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,840
 have a copy of the fourth edition I mean I'd love it if there was a PDF version but I don't think

646
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,720
 there is like if someone did have it I presume it's still the same as the first edition it's sort of

647
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,120
 like a team game and then you have like a games master reading out a scenario of a thing that's

648
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,240
 happened at the convention and you have to decide how you're going to deal with it and you have

649
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,320
 finite amounts of people points and money points and something else points and if we could find

650
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,640
 one I would play it with you guys as a podcast I think it could be quite funny but also we might

651
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:57,600
 just be mean about it because it's very dated at this point. If anyone has a copy of um Mystic

652
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,440
 Con the British one and would like to lend it to us that would also be quite funny I think.

653
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,600
 Bring it to a fan fun dog shit and I will spend an unwise amount of money on it.

654
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,120
 Yeah if somebody could bring a copy of um Zucon to a fan fun dog should that

655
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:17,200
 would probably be on that too I should think. Now that I know that it's available from

656
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:24,960
 Nest4Press for $15 like that does put somewhat of a um upper limit on why I might be willing to pay.

657
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,720
 It does say it's got some kind of additional scenarios added in the uh

658
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:34,240
 oh in the 2015 update um sorry I just found a website which is claiming it will sell me the

659
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,440
 PDF for $5 now I have to see if they're actually. Linky, Linky or look at the page.

660
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,120
 Oh all right so I guess this is Nest4 have put it on a print on demand tight.

661
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,600
 Oh no that looks legit. Yeah yeah we probably do want this as a new book right?

662
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:57,520
 I mean we're all about to buy it I assume all three of us are currently creating an account on

663
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,560
 the book patch.com and you know they say that just listening to people doing things in

664
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:09,360
 silence is not podcasting gold but I think in this case it might be. I've tried to buy it on PayPal

665
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:15,360
 and PayPal has said that it's gonna review my thing for security reasons. Why is that?

666
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,400
 I know why that is it's because they got three purchases for the same item

667
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:27,280
 two different countries all at the same time. No I've bought it so uh oh okay fine.

668
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,800
 Liz let the side down. Well I'm gonna do it later.

669
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,320
 Top Encouraging to meet a multitask while on the podcast don't. Yeah.

670
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:39,680
 Sometimes I ask you a question you sort of have zoned out and I'm like John is reading

671
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,040
 something right now so stop encouraging me to do that. eBay who clearly knows what I like

672
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:51,680
 has just sent me a link to a palette of 200 random board games. Oh board game.

673
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,760
 I know we were talking earlier about cost per play and never spending more than a certain amount

674
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,960
 per board game but I do think there is some merit in selecting the board games you want to play.

675
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,400
 I think this is probably if you would like if you like opening that board game pub that I'm not

676
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,240
 gonna open in 2023 I would actually go for something like that as a way to have a lot of games.

677
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,920
 When you say it's a palette of 200 random board games are you sure they're 200 different board

678
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,080
 games. They might be 200 copies of cocoson. In which case you've got a very boring pub.

679
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:26,160
 Palot job loved over 200 assorted board games. Games will differ to those in the photo but will

680
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:33,280
 be similar games are all unchecked. I sorted he's doing a lot of work there for 200 pounds and

681
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:40,720
 and they look mostly like 200 pounds for 200 board games here. That's a pallet board game it's deep.
