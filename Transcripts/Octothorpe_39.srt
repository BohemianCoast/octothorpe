1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 John, edit this down.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I'm going to, don't worry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Edit it down to only the funny bits.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 I have faith.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Yeah, you've got to edit our lesson.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Oh, is it going to be very careful edit?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 39th episode of Octa Thorpe,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 which is coming to you on the 2nd of September 2021.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 The podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm John Coxon.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm Alison Scott.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I know I'm Liz Batty.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Summer is over.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 There is no more fun.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Cease having fun immediately.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Now I'm really gloomy.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Yes, it has been summer.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 But we have all sat down at our usual recording rigs on the usual day at the usual time

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 and we are recording a usual Octa Thorpe.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 It's been a while.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 It's been like six weeks since we sat together on our Sunday morning recording

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Octa Thorpe in our separate places.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Too fair.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I'm not in the usual place.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Are you on Plague Island?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Well, I think that I am on Plague Island,

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 but specifically the reason I could be here is it is least Plague Island, I think.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I am in Sandbox Quarantine.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Worst Sandbox game ever.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 If Liz actually says the name of the place she is, I have to bleep it,

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 so please don't say the name Liz.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It's not pronounced like that.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Is it not?

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 How is it pronounced Liz?

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Who can't?

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Oh, f*ck it.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Definitely not pronounced about that.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 You're all very rude.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Yeah, Alison.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 It's like are you five?

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Yes, you are.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Hey, I resemble that remark.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I am 12.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 We have a myriad of letters of comment,

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 but on the subject of the word myriad,

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I was reading this here,

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 and Mark Plummer used the word plethora in a letter of comment,

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 wondering if I would spot that it was a reference to Octa Thorpe,

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 and I sent him an email saying Alison would not approve,

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 and he sent me an email back saying, "Aha, you read it."

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So that was very good and made me google quite a lot.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Hoorah.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 So yeah, me and Mark are now like, I guess, doing references for each other in our locks.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 This is a great sport, I highly recommend.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And we have letters of comment, although not from Mark,

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 but we have letters of comment from Ali Baker,

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Fran Dowd, Chris Garcia, twice,

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Caroline Mersey, Karen Schafer and Peter Sullivan.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Yeah, this is what happens when we don't do a regular episode of six weeks, isn't it?

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 We have a backlog of a myriad of plethoras or something.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 We have a blog, which is a backlog of logs.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Ali Baker writes to tell us about her hobby of watching

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 how inappropriate children's books that are recommended to children

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 by adults who haven't read the book for 50 years can be.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yes.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 She includes the next time I see Pierre Santini recommended for a nine-year-old girl,

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I'm burning the internet down.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I have never read any Pierre Santini and I have never been a nine-year-old girl,

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 so I am badly placed to comment on this.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 But Ali does say don't recommend Enid Blightened kids,

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 and yeah, I think even someone who read Enid Blightened when I was a kid,

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I would not do that now.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 No.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 She also says she's seen Conan the Barbarian recommended for an eight-year-old boy,

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 and if you have an eight-year-old boy who you think might like that sort of thing,

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 they might like Beast Quest books if they haven't read them already,

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 which are basically Conan the Barbarian without so much sex and violence.

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 In fact, without the barbarous bits, I think I realise.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 On the subject of Ali, our very own Alison Scott was on episode three of Fantasy BookSwap,

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 which at the time recording is the latest episode.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I was discussing Tamarind and the Star of Ishtar by Jasbin de Billan,

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 and Marianne Dreams by Catherine Store, which was my fondly-remembered children's book,

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 which I think held up quite well.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 It's a bit old-fashioned, but it doesn't have anything that causes you to choke on your tea,

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 unlike many of these books from Aft childhood.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Yep, that's rare.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And it was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed doing it,

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 but it was me kind of talking with Ali about books for a whole hour,

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 which is not like me, because I don't normally talk about books very much at all.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Is that why Fault in the Spillennial Daughter has the name she has?

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Yeah, no, she's named after Marianne of...

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Well, she's not named after Marianne of Marianne Dreams,

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 who's a grumpy, spoiled child, but I liked the name,

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 and that's why I liked it.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I had liked it for quite a long time, and when I said,

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 "Should we call our daughter Marianne?"

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Stephen was kind of like, "Hm, yeah, I suppose."

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 That's kind of half of a nice story.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Ali said that starting the podcast had got her unblocked on reading.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 That's really good.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 I thought it was...

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It seems to have got other people unblocked on reading as well,

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 and I think it's really good as a way to start to think critically about books

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 without having to think too critically about them, if you see what I mean.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So I really enjoyed doing it, and I think it's a great podcast, and people should listen.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 He agreed, and Ali am going to be on a forthcoming episode of Fantasy Book Swap as well.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So I very, very nervously emailed Ali to be like,

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 "I'm sure that you've got loads of people, but if you need someone, I would love to be on."

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And Ali very kindly invited me.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 "Did it invite if you ask?"

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I don't know, probably not.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I invaded an invitation, I suppose.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And yeah, so I'm going to be on.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I'm super excited.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 She sent me the suggestions for the books that she might link with my book,

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 and one of them I was like, "Ooh, I want to read that anyway."

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 So I'm going to read that one.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I'm very excited, and it's also, and this is a hint to the listener.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 It has recently been made into a movie, which you can stream on Disney+,

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 so I'm also excited to watch the movie after I've read the book.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 So it's like going to be a whole thing, and I'm super, super, super jazzed about it.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 So, hurrah!

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Thank you very much to Ali for her lock.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And then we have a lock from Fran Dowd, who writes about a piece she wrote for the program book for Intuition in 1998,

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 which started as an all-women committee, and she wrote a piece called From the Depths of the Sopher.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And it's a kind of a long paragraph, and I'm not going to read it out here.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 But it was kind of talking about how they did their internal structure for running their convention,

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 and kind of, instead of having a line management system, they had a webbed subgrouping pattern.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So instead, you kind of had a working group of people, and then you had different kind of groups of people

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 doing different things within that kind of large group.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And it sounded really interesting.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I might ask her if I could just put the piece in the show notes, or link to it somewhere if it's online.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 But yeah, so it's really interesting to take on kind of how you can do kind of convention running

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 in a way that is a bit less strictured, and ties into some of the stuff we were saying about divisions

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 and that kind of thing in previous episodes with regards to Eastercons and Worldcon.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Not sure it would work for a Worldcon, probably too big to be running in a kind of anarchic way,

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 but definitely possible for smaller conventions.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Yeah, I found interesting how I had no idea this happened in 1998,

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 and I suspect a lot of people who weren't working on the con in 1998, or really paying attention kind of know about it.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And it's interesting, because I don't think anyone's ever tried it this way again.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 I suppose I know most conventions have gone back to having kind of a fairly traditional committee structure.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 So yeah, it was interesting for two reasons.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 One that, you know, Fran saying this is only a historical interest,

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 but yeah, it is like history that I had no idea about.

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I may have been completely forgotten if we don't have Fran or other people around the time letting us know.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 But also, yeah, it doesn't seem like anyone's ever tried it again.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 So if you have tried running a convention in a similarly non sort of committee based hierarchical way,

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 please let us know.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 What like punctuation, you mean?

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Well, we already covered punctuation in our kind of like weird anarchic collective type approach,

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 but I mean, we do sort of have roles.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So the 1988 East Con didn't have a chair, and that was quite stressful.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 What were you doing for the 1998 East Con?

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Causing trouble.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 All right.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 [laughter]

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 It's good to know that some things haven't changed much over the last 32 years.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I feel like I was kind of like the Jamie Tarte of Con running.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 [laughter]

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Alison Scott do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

 Alison Scott.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Yeah, if you put that on the podcast, the baby shot, the lawyers will be in contact with you.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 [laughter]

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I don't know what you mean, entirely original track.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I was so yes, there were too many egos and it was we were all young.

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Very young.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 We all felt much older than I mean there were people who was old as 29 on that committee.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And Roger Robinson.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Oh no, Roger Robinson wasn't on the committee.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 He stepped aside sharply.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 [laughter]

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 I have an important question, Trace, which is if Alison Scott is Jamie Tarte and I presume John is Ted Lasso, then who am I?

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Roy Ken.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 [laughter]

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 [beep]

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 [laughter]

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Chris Garcia sent us two letters of comment.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 He didn't just get super enthusiastic.

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 It's just that we didn't do anything with the first one until he sent a second one.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So he says that with regard to convention of publications, things have changed and ACOM materials are actually more important.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 What the ACOM newsletter does is present you with the essential info in one curated spot.

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And yeah, I think I'd agree with him on that point and kind of talks about he then goes on to agree with us on.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 I'm trying to bring publications and promotions under the same umbrella and et cetera and et cetera.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 But that's all kind of from the world con perspective.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 In his follow-up letter of comment, he says that Celsius is just wrong and we should do another punctuation.

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 One of those two statements is correct.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 [laughter]

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Agreed.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I would also like to pull out Chris's point.

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He does mention that part of his job is to be a social media professional and he mentions how good promoted tweets can be,

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 which is something I hadn't thought of about what is the return for doing kind of promoted tweets and promoted Instagram posts.

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I think I've seen some sort of like promotional Facebook post boosting being used.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And I think you did that for FollyCon or we did that for FollyCon, but I'll let you do it because you know we're at Facebook.

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Only to the extent that Facebook said, "Oh, you don't appear to have boosted this with ads, but you've used ads on other pages in the past,

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 have £33 to run ads."

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And I said, "I will run exactly £30 worth of ads for nothing and then I will stop."

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 I do not think that Facebook boosting is good for community groups and I am very happy to talk about why not at length in a bar sometime

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 because it's unlikely that Facebook will show your post to the people who need to see it.

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 What does work very well though is getting all your mates to share out posts on their personal pages.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 If you can get them to do that, then you will get traction.

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 The other thing that Chris says in his second layer of comment is that one thing that he's interested in at the moment

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 is when we're going to take up the question of what roles podcasts should be playing in fandom today.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Maybe it's me, Chris writes, but we've got a bunch of great podcasts about science fiction but a last few about fandom.

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And while the origins of OctaThorp are as clear as rainwater, which I think is a compliment,

205
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 what should the role of podcasts be? Are they simply fanzine replacements? Are they more appropriately tools to allow for debate

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 on topics of fanishness-esque subjects? What? And I would just like to say, I agree.

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I think the complementary to fanzines, aren't they? Because a good fanzine probably has some tooth some articles in it

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 and although podcasts could be doing that sort of thing, they mostly, well, we don't.

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I mean, other people do. We could get, we could have interviews with the important mover and shaker fans of the day

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 and things like that.

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 So it occurs to me, we could do a serial-esque, true crime-esque episode of OctaThorp where we do like a deep dive into some

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 convention thing, but we present it all as like highly dramatised interviews with people who were there.

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 That sounds like an absolutely fast amount of work.

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Be quite funny though.

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Oh, I said no to something yesterday.

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Oh well done.

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Yeah, no, that's what you'd be pleased.

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Yeah, I'm not good at that.

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I also, I also said, I think we should probably help with that about something much bigger.

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 So, you know, it's okay.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Right, fair enough.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Swings, roundabouts.

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 John, have you watched American Vandal on Netflix?

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I have not.

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Should I?

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 So it is basically a sort of, it's a comedy show about like, you know, a teenager at a high school who investigates in a kind of serious,

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 you know, true crime drama, serial podcast style, the question of who drew a load of ticks on some cards in the car park.

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 It's very funny.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 It really kind of captures that sort of true crime documentary style thing in a way you were suggesting.

230
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 So I think basically you should watch that because I think what you're proposing is that we do American Vandal with a load of

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Spanish in-jokes.

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 That actually could be incredibly funny.

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Though I feel like Andy Hooper's radio plays were trying to get into that sort of space.

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 No, I mean, and it sounds a bit like, I don't know if either of you have seen the Ryan Johnson film Brick,

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 which is a noir set in a high school, which is also amazing, and would highly recommend to any listeners who have not interacted with it.

236
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 But I really like things that take the, especially, especially stuff that has like a really specific and defined language

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 that applies it to something that it really wasn't intended to.

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I love it.

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 So I will have to look up American Vandal.

240
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Thank you for the recommendation, Aliz.

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 But I, I, I, I learned to go back to Wiles from saying, but I basically think that, yeah, podcasts are, I think, complementary to fanzines.

242
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 It slightly frustrates me that there's not more people from the fanzine, fandom tradition, exploring different media.

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Because I like old style fanzines, but I wouldn't have mind if like some of the people that were writing them were also doing other stuff that was a bit less old school.

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 But that's a conversation for, well, it's a conversation we've already had on previous episodes, and we will probably have again on subsequent episodes.

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Hara, Pat McMurray wrote to say that he really enjoyed our piece on communications, and he talks about kind of his thoughts on what convention communications are for,

246
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 which I think we, we covered, but he's kind of vociferously agreeing with us.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 But he also says that if he was going to go on the Fantasy Books podcast, he would pick either Swallows and Amazons or Citizen of the Galaxy.

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I mean, I think Swallows and Amazons, I'm not sure whether, I think eventually, Ali will probably have someone on who just has a thoroughly on un-genre.

249
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Um, but.

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Yeah, Marianne Dreams was quite close.

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But I mean, I think it's genre, I would argue it was genre.

252
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 It's got magic in, so.

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I think it's hard to argue that for Swallows and Amazons, unless it's all a dream.

254
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 If you actually had, we didn't mean to go to see or the other, what's the other, um, Fantasy one.

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Two of them are not, a Fantasy novels, not, not, um, they're Fantasy novels about sailing.

256
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Yeah.

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 But they're, they're, they're the stories the children make up.

258
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 So, so you could have one of those, and it would be on topic.

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 That's true, and for that.

260
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Caroline Mersey points out that we've omitted Trebake from our baked goods taxonomy.

261
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And says that Brownie's millionaire short-read Rocky Road Tiffin and Fifteens are Trebakes and not cakes nor biscuits.

262
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Now, I don't know what Fifteens are.

263
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 No, they're Fifteens aren't.

264
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 What is a Fifteen? I've never heard of this.

265
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Okay, so Fifteens aren't, I mean, I'd defer because Caroline Mersey is actually from Northern Ireland, and these are an all-in-arish thing.

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Um, Fifteens are made from Fifteens and various different things, like Fifteens, Glasset cherries and Fifteens chocolate buttons.

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 I can't quite remember.

268
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Fifteen marshmallows, Fifteens ounces of flour.

269
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I don't, don't quote me.

270
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I'll find a recipe and they are delicious.

271
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 But when I have made them, you have rolled it all up in the log and put the log in the fridge and I cut it into Fifteens slices.

272
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 So, that might be a different, I might have been using a slightly different recipe to her.

273
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Fair enough.

274
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I have a ingredients for Fifteens, Fifteen digestive biscuits, Fifteens marshmallows, Fifteens glassy cherries.

275
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 This sounds amazing.

276
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 A small tin of condensed milk and a loaded desiccated coconut and they are very delicious.

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Okay.

278
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And I will put the link in the show note.

279
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 They do sound very nice.

280
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And then people can argue possibly a lot.

281
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 But it's not a tray bake because it's not baked.

282
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 You just basically roll it up and stick it in the fridge and then cut it up and eat it because it's made from cooked things.

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 But I know what, because I know what Caroline means, because I would have called Rocky Road a tray bake too.

284
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 But you don't really bake Rocky Road.

285
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 You melt the chocolate pour it into a tray with the ingredients and then leave that in the fridge to set as well.

286
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 So, so it's...

287
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Yeah, but that's still in a tray.

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Yeah, that is true.

289
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 But no, my view is that things like flapjacks and brownies are traybakes because you bake them in a tray.

290
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Very, very simple soul.

291
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Look, all right, stop it with your unceasing logic.

292
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And then Liz, Peter Sullivan agrees with you.

293
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So Liz, do you want to tell us what Peter Sullivan agrees with you about?

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Peter, agrees with me or conventions not like just randomly posting stuff about fandom generally in order to boost their social media activity,

295
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 which is something I call that was being a basically a not great way of engaging with people because it just feels super generic.

296
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And back in the days before social media, he says he ran the RSS feed for the Christopher Taff campaign,

297
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 which is basically posting whenever Chris Garcia did something on the internet, which is basically all the time.

298
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 So really, it seems like the key thing here is that conventions need Chris Garcia as part of their convention in order to have a continual stream of things to post about on the internet.

299
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Or if not Chris Garcia, some Chris Garcia equivalent.

300
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I think we need a standard unit of Garcia's for this.

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I feel like I'm looking for something like a milligarsia as a unit of exuberance.

302
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 What could Chris launch?

303
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Maybe it's like, you know, some people lock Octa Thorpe at a rate of five milligarsia's, which means they send us a letter every so often rather than a letter every time we release an episode.

304
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I think we should probably define the unit of locking Octa Thorpe as the Briarly and not the Garcia.

305
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 That is true.

306
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Karen Schafer says that I am right, yes, and that brownies are bar cookies, which I think might be the American word for trabakes.

307
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Oh no, they're trabakes. Don't they have trabakes? They have trabakes in America.

308
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Do they or do they have bar cookies? Because I'd never heard of a bar cookie before.

309
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Yes, a shortbread's a bar cookie, right?

310
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 She doesn't mention that.

311
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 No, because they don't really have shortbread in America. I mean, they do, but it's terrible.

312
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Do we need a Twitter poll on this one?

313
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Oh, maybe.

314
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Engagement, hashtag engagement, hashtag content.

315
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 She did also send us a picture which I will put in the show notes of a page from a cookbook she has in which she says how to make bar cookies.

316
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 So I will put that in the show notes, but it includes brownies, dainty tea brownies, brownie confections and butter scotch brownies.

317
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 So I might have to try making some of these. Thank you very much, Karen.

318
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Peter Sullivan tweets in about degrees Kelvin.

319
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 There was a postal games fanzine called absolute zero that started at issue minus 273 and got to issue about minus 250 before it folded.

320
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 He has no idea why he thinks he might we might want to know this, but I enjoyed knowing it very much.

321
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 So thank you, Peter.

322
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Is it very good scheme for a fanzine to call absolute zero and start at minus 273? That's just 10 out of 10.

323
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 10 out of 10 temperature fanzining.

324
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 But that concludes the letters of comment.

325
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Whoo!

326
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 So this week we heard the sad news of the death of Earl Courshack.

327
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 So Earl Courshack was one of the last two surviving attendees of the first Worldcon and also part of the leadership of the Worldcon in 1940 in Chicago.

328
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 He was scheduled to be a guest of honor at Chicon 8 in 2022, which would have been 82 years since he had chaired the Chicago Worldcon.

329
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 So I think he was member of the leadership of the Chicago Worldcon at age 17 or 18 and then it had been invited back basically for the most recent Chicago Worldcon.

330
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 I met him very briefly in 2019 at the Dublin Worldcon.

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I think he came into program ops and we chatted a little bit and it was really astounding to me that I could still meet someone who was coming to convention, so he'd been there kind of right at the start of everything.

332
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 So it's sort of right at the start of organized fandom.

333
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And I think that is something that we are gradually losing.

334
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 We now have one attendee left of the first Worldcon.

335
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And it's just another sad event that kind of all this Spanish history is that was there for us to talk to and spend time with is now passing on.

336
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 I also kind of really loved that he had a long enough life and a long enough career and a long and Spanish career that he could actually lead Worldcons very early in his life, then drop out to fandom for many years and then come back to find that Worldcons were still going on.

337
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And I would love to know what he thought when he sort of came back to Worldcons in the 1980s to see what they'd become.

338
00:22:34,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 To some extent it's sad that we're losing these threads to our early history, but I think it's kind of fantastic that fandom has survived and remembers its traditions and has that continuous thread of experience that goes on for long enough that people who got into it as young teenagers are now dying at the age of, I don't know,

339
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 World was quite old, but Bob Madal who is the lost survivor is 101 because I sent him a little badge with a propelebenie on it for his 100th birthday last year.

340
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 I don't think it's that sad, I think it's kind of nice that we have all of that tradition and that we wrote it down because of fanzines and as guests podcasts are also a record, though I don't know if anyone's going to go back in 100 years and listen to old podcasts and go, "Well, what was Weetabix anyway?"

341
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 I didn't get to meet Earl, I did on my TAFT trip, get to meet Russ Hodgkins who chaired Chikon One, which was amazing and he was at the first Worldcon and I got to meet Dave Koyer and Art Widner as well.

342
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And it's fantastic to kind of get to interact with people who do connect right back to the start and I don't know whether any of those people have kind of written about their perception of the differences between fandom then and fandom now, but I agree with Liz so that would be interesting.

343
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 But it is really nice that there's this consistent throughline right back to the beginning of our community and I'm not always interested in using that as an excuse not to move forward as a community, but it is really nice to have that sense of tradition and of history and to understand our origins is a lovely thing to be able to do.

344
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 So yeah, it's a very great shame and as Alison says, only one remaining person who does kind of take us right back to the beginning.

345
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 I think Chikon H has said that they are going to honor Earl anyway as you would expect them to do.

346
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 I think that is the normal practice when guests of honor die between the announcement and the convention and hopefully they'll find some good ways to do that.

347
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 You can of course, you can't interact with people from the earliest days of fandom, but you know what they thought quite a lot because they live left of the fanzines and you can read those.

348
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I mean, it's not true that everybody was a fanzine fan even back at the very beginning, but there were lots of fans fans around.

349
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 And yeah, no, Dave Kyle was always very fond of newsletters and he would always go into the newsletter room at every Worldcon and congratulate the team on doing what the best Worldcon newsletter ever.

350
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And it wasn't until about the third time round that we worked out that we were sick or we should just kind of go, "Oh, that's nice."

351
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Excellent.

352
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 [Music]

353
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Okay, on the topic of Worldcons, Discom 3 have released their new COVID-19 policy and we've linked to the file 770 post about that in the show notes, which has not only the policy in question, but a plethora of comments you can read discussing people's thoughts on this announcement.

354
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Basically, you can't go unless you're double vaccinated, you've got to wear a mask at all times and if there are reasons why you can't have had the vaccine and you can't wear a mask, you should look at getting a refund or attending virtually.

355
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And you can read more about this, as I say, in this article in the show notes.

356
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I think this in some ways makes a lot of sense and in some ways has made Alison very grumpy. So Alison, do you want to, maybe I should introduce your thoughts a bit more diplomatically? What do you reckon?

357
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 No, I mean, I don't think I was very grumpy, but you were saying reaction have been mostly positive.

358
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 I've not seen many negative takes.

359
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And I have seen some negative stuff, but not a vast amounts. Most people are happy. This policy disenfranchises people who can't get vaccinated or cannot wear masks, both of which do actually exist in countries that are less benighted than the United States.

360
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 If you can't get vaccinated, you can get a your COVID, you will still get a COVID certificate. If your doctor said you cannot have a vaccine, you will still get a COVID certificate.

361
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 But that's not the case of the US, so it is disenfranchising people. It is disenfranchising everyone with a child under 12.

362
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And the notion that the way that you're going to deal with marginal groups is to say, just don't come.

363
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 It's like taking the whole story on inclusivity and making it possible for people to do things back 50 years.

364
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And, you know, they could do that and they think it's legal. I don't think it would be legal here, but I think it might be legal there.

365
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 So it would be interesting to see whether that's the case, but I think they could have gone quite a lot further to say, oh, right, no, we will make accommodations for people, but we will require a letter from your doctor or we will require you.

366
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 If you've got children, we'll require you to quarantine for two weeks before coming to the convention, something like that. They could have done these things if they wanted to.

367
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 And they decided, oh, no, we'll just, it's easier to just exclude chunks of the community.

368
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 The other thing that concerns me about this is that I don't think the clear masks that they're going, they may find that they're marvelous and it's all fine.

369
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I'm interested to see how that goes. I don't know how doing program items through masks is going to work. I don't know whether it's actually going to be significantly better than being on Zoom.

370
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 I do know that what you do, if you sort of say, oh, well, we'll implement extremely stringent conditions in public area of the hotels is that you'll encourage people to go and socialize in room parties and other places where those conditions work.

371
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Conditions won't pertain. You might go, oh, well, those are the people who don't care. But in fact, I'd rather see well ventilated public spaces and I'd like to see some testing, which they're not doing at all as far as I can see.

372
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 I think it's an interesting choice. And I hope everyone who goes has a phatactic time. They've also disenfranchised everyone in the UK, but in fact, that's just because we can't travel to America.

373
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 I don't know if we'll ever be able to travel to America again.

374
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I feel less strongly about than Alison, all this probably because I do not have never had kids under 12. So, you know, this would not be something that would stop me going.

375
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I think they're just in a very, very tricky situation.

376
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And I suspect they thought this was the best way to get the majority of their attendees there because I think they not had a vaccine mandate and a mask mandate.

377
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 They would have also had a large number of people who said they didn't want to come because they didn't feel it was safe.

378
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 So I think they've chosen this route on some very difficult public health grounds.

379
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I think there are problems. If they had tried to mandate quarantine for two weeks, well, you can't mandate quarantine for two weeks because you can't actually check on that one.

380
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 So you could ask people to do it. But obviously, if they felt they could run a convention on, please wear masks and please get vaccinated before you come if you're able.

381
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Then they do that, but in fact, they feel they have to mandate it in order to get that to happen.

382
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Yeah, I think it's really tricky. I think a large part of this is going to depend on how well they manage this kind of hybrid in-person virtual thing they're trying to pull off because obviously there are lots of people who can't go.

383
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 No one with children or 12 can go. People who cannot get vaccinated cannot go because there's no medical exemptions, even for that very small proportion of people who can't get vaccinated.

384
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Obviously, it is going to be difficult to get people from non-U.S. or maybe Canada to the convention, partly because some of them are completely blocked from entering the country and partly because some of them are not vaccinated and will not be vaccinated by December and therefore can't come to the convention.

385
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 So I think it's really tricky and I would obviously like to see this not have to be the case, but I think when they have to decide now what they think they will be like in December and what they think they have to do to put on a safe convention, this is the route they've chosen.

386
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And like we say, it's not new. It's the same approach that convergence com took earlier this month. I'm not sure if there are other U.S. conventions that have had the same plans.

387
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 I've not actually looked at what Dragoncom's policy is. I should look that one up.

388
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And yeah, I can't comment on it from a legal standpoint. Obviously, just going to think this is something that they can do in the United States and given that other conventions, I wouldn't be surprised.

389
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 I'm not sure if the same is true in the UK or if there's a way you could say do this in the UK, but with sufficient opt outs.

390
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 And I think they should also be encouraging testing even with maximum vaccination with potentially thousands of people in one place.

391
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And it is December in Washington, D.C. People are going to be socializing indoors. They are probably not going to be socializing outdoors.

392
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 I think you would try and encourage people to at least be doing lateral flow tests on a daily or every 48-hour basis, just in case.

393
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 I mean, lateral flow tests not perfect, but they catch a lot of positive cases if you could cut down the number of...

394
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 It's just another string to your bow, really.

395
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Yeah, it's another string to your bow. You have your strings of vaccines and masks and social distancing and ventilation and testing.

396
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And you put all those things together and you know, it's like the Swiss cheese model. You're less likely to get a big hole.

397
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I think in general I am a little bit surprised they're not doing testing.

398
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Liz informs me that the US does not have free lateral flow testing, which may have meant that D.C. felt unable to mandate every on take a lateral flow every day.

399
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 But I think if this was being done in the UK, we would probably be doing that.

400
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Although I say that, but I don't know whether an overcon or a core flu or fantasy con are. I haven't really seen much from any of them.

401
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 So whenever I go to anything, I do lateral flow tests before I go to it and then after I come back.

402
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 And when you go onto the NHS website to report your result, it's always like, "Why would you be doing that? We can't see any reason.

403
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 This isn't one of the reasons why anyone would use a lateral flow test."

404
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 I'm kind of like, "You know what? Your messaging is way off."

405
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 So yeah, so I lateral flow before I go out pretty well.

406
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Certainly before I go to a fake festival or a science fiction convention or anything like, "Well, meet my mates for drinking."

407
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 But that doesn't have any bearing on policies from UK conventions, right? Like, I agree with you. I also do that.

408
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 But like, the Discon has a more coherent COVID strategy than any of the British conventions happening for the rest of this year, I would say.

409
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Even if we don't agree with necessarily how they're implementing it.

410
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 I think part of the difference is that I think for something like NovaCon, which is Friday through Sunday, taking a lateral flow say on the Friday morning and then not testing again, might be OK.

411
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Whereas for a five-day event like WorldCon, you could potentially have people becoming kind of infected and symptomatic, sorry, not symptomatic, kind of becoming infected and becoming infectious kind of within the five days.

412
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 So maybe it's more important to try and get people to test midway through the con because then you might at least get alerted to the fact that you're going to have a super spreading event at your con.

413
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Oh no, I mean, I completely agree with that. But like, I've just looked at the FantasyCon website and it doesn't even ask you to do a lateral flow before you sit off.

414
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 There's literally no COVID policy on their website at all.

415
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 NovaCon have said that they are going to have a COVID policy which reflects the state of affairs at the time they hold their convention and they have Dave Hicks doing this.

416
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 So they seem to have this in hand.

417
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Their website notes that he is a dipney Bosch, a gradios, an ISO 18001 lead auditor, and he's won three nose rewards.

418
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 But it's not clear to me which of those qualifications puts him in better stead for the COVID policy.

419
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Yeah, he's a health and safety professional, so he does know about this stuff.

420
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Yeah, but like, it's not they don't have a policy.

421
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Well, I mean, they shouldn't have a policy yet because they don't need to set their policy until a few weeks before the convention.

422
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 That might be fair.

423
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 That's not so true for the WorldCon where people make travel plans, but I think for NovaCon.

424
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 But they're expecting a lot of international visitors to NovaCon because it's been scheduled right after Corfley.

425
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 And I don't think Corfley has anything about COVID on their website.

426
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 So like, I think it's fair to criticize the weaknesses in the DC plan, but at least they've got one that they're talking about.

427
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 I'm a little bit concerned.

428
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 I mean, NovaCon say they will have one, which is something.

429
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 FantasyCon is in four weeks and has no mention and Corfley is in two months and has no mention.

430
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 And it's like, what are you doing? Like, I want to know because I've bought my Corfley membership, but if it turns out that anyone can go and have licked anything they want, I'm going to be pissed.

431
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Well, I think you should be less pissed because I think people are overestimating the risks of this disease to the fully vaccinated.

432
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 So you might want, if you would say caring for somebody who is immunocompromised or couldn't have a vaccine for whatever reason, you might want to make different personal decisions.

433
00:35:49,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 If you're fully vaccinated, you're saying, "Oh, well, I might go pony trekking, but I wouldn't go to this convention because of the risk of getting a breakthrough case of COVID."

434
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 You're making very poor risk decisions because, or you know, you might travel on a motorway or cross or cross busy roads.

435
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 You know, it's not that dangerous, is it?

436
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 But I minimise my risk. If I'm going to cross the busy road, I will cross at the crossing. If I want to minimise my risk, then if I know everyone else at the convention is vaccinated, I know the chances of them having an infection are lower, and it seems to be the chances of them transmitting to other people are lower.

437
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Whereas if I don't know if one of the convention is vaccinated, then there is a higher risk. So, you know, I don't think it's, you know, that, I mean, I don't think it's entirely overestimating risk, just that there is a risk and we know ways we can minimise that risk.

438
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And we don't know at the moment, in what ways, cold flu and overcon are going to do that.

439
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Yeah, and like, I think, I think in general, like, I am happy that overcon have thought about this and I'm not entirely sure what their policy will be, but I think they will at least be trying to minimise that risk.

440
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 But in the case of a convention that hasn't mentioned it at all, you're sort of like, well, how are you managing this risk?

441
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Because I do think, although, like, I don't know, I'm not well versed enough in the biology of it to know what the actual risk is.

442
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 And I don't, I get the impression that this is actually not a well known thing and it's a sort of much controversy in many different circles.

443
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Like, I want, if there is a significant risk, I want it to be mitigated.

444
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And like, I'm not sure that requiring natural flow tests before setting off and requiring that if people can be vaccinated, they are vaccinated, is unreasonable.

445
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 And if the convention is not even willing to do that level of leadership, then I am not impressed by that.

446
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Because even if it's milder than it might be, I still don't want to get it if I can help it.

447
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 So, Corflu, if you're the Corflu Committee and you're listening to this, which I'm sure you are, then it's time to sort out your COVID policy and, um, incidentally, please don't copy me into the emails.

449
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Thanks.

450
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 Corflu's been copying me into emails while running a virtual convention.

451
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Brilliant. That must be amazing.

452
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And then they, having done that, which was fine, they carried on copying me into emails about traveling techniques and PR4 and all sorts.

453
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 And I am not on the Corflu Committee.

454
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 I'm just deleting these emails unread at this point.

455
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 You know, people end up with a cat because, you know, a cat walks in.

456
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 I think this is how you got the Corflu Committee.

457
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 No.

458
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Oh, no.

459
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Anyway, I had a more serious point, which is, I think you can tell just from our discussion here that, you know, the three of us probably have slightly different ways.

460
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 And we have, like, slightly different attitudes to COVID risk.

461
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 And I think one reason as well for having your convention policy out way ahead of time is to find out what your membership thinks.

462
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 Um, because I think it's going to be really useful to you to know whether your COVID policy has just made 50% of your attendees say, you know, actually, I don't feel I'm going to attend this year.

463
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 And that's probably something you want to know sooner rather than later.

464
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 We emailed FantasyCon to ask whether they had a COVID policy and they say that they do is just that they've only put it on their emailing list and they haven't updated their website.

465
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 And that's why I couldn't find it.

466
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Leaving that aside.

467
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 The policy is basically the situation is changeable.

468
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 They don't have control of the whole venue and it is difficult to mandate requirements and the political climate and some spaces will make it difficult to achieve distancing.

469
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 They are asking attendees to wear face masks indoors. They are providing sanitizer in all the rooms.

470
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 They are encouraging distancing where possible.

471
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 And they are going to encourage people to take a lateral flow test before attending.

472
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 And if they have symptoms to get a full COVID test and if they are not well, please do not attend.

473
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 So don't go if you've got COVID.

474
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 That's important.

475
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And they do also note if a group of people wish to sit or stand close together they can, but they would ask attendees to respect that other attendees may need space.

476
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 I mean, okay, I guess.

477
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 I'm quite comfortable with that sort of policy because I kind of think if you're going to a convention it's because you want to see your friends.

478
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 But I'll grant you it's a lot wishy washer than the, than the, um, discount one.

479
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 I would be requiring masks in, um, flow spaces between program items and I would be requiring natural flow tests.

480
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 I don't think I would be asking nicely on those.

481
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 And I hope that because I think what happens is you get what happens on the trains, which is they ask people to wear a face mask and then about 5% of people do.

482
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 And that I don't like.

483
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 The thing about lateral flow tests is that you can't actually mandate them.

484
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 So what you can do is say, please can everyone take a lateral flow test, but I mean, any checking process you have is going to be a bit rubbish.

485
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 This is the same thing that happened with the mask because people argued when the government made wearing masks, not wearing masks in shops illegal.

486
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 That it would be very difficult to enforce.

487
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 But what happened is a large number of people started wearing masks because it had been mandated and then stopped again when it was no longer mandated.

488
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 And it didn't really matter that there wasn't a coherent enforcement policy. It was the fact that it was mandatory that did it for a lot of people.

489
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 And I think there is a difference in even if your process for checking whether people are obeying is a bit rubbish, you still see it uptick in, in doing it.

490
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 If you say you have to rather than we encourage you to.

491
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Yes, so I have a little policy hat on here, which is that you cannot mandate things without sanctions.

492
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 So if you say something, you must do something, then you have to have something that says, and if you don't, this will happen.

493
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 You don't have to have enforcement, but you do have to have sanctions.

494
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 But we probably don't have sanctions in practice.

495
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 So I think it's still fine to say we want everyone to do this.

496
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 But I think if you say you must do this, then you are mandating it. So you say otherwise we will kick you out of the convention.

497
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 I think you just have to say you should take a lateral flow test before attending.

498
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 You can't say you must because we can't make you.

499
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 But I think if you say something like you should take a lateral flow test before attending, maybe it's a bit more forceful than it would be.

500
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 It would be a good idea if you took a lateral flow test.

501
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 And the only other way to do it is to have a bunch of like desks where you have to watch people swap their own noses.

502
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 But I feel that's going to have a risk.

503
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 I also like that they'll have sanitizer because having been to two festivals, one of which said, "Oh, we will have sanitizing stations everywhere and did."

504
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 And one of which said, "We will have sanitizing stations everywhere and didn't."

505
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 I know which one I prefer.

506
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 The UK Games Expo did was they said that lateral flow tests were mandatory before attending, and you had to bring the text message you got from the NHS.

507
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 Obviously that would be trivially easy to forge.

508
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 But the thing is it's not so much about, obviously there are loopholes in that way of doing it that you could drive a bus through.

509
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 But the thing is, I think it would still mean you got more obeying than just sort of asking nicely.

510
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 That was actually something that got implemented after they said, "Oh, we're going to ask nicely."

511
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 And social media just went, "What?" and said, "What?" for long enough that they changed their minds eventually.

512
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 So I do think the other thing is if our community does not make a loud enough noise about, actually, we'd quite like you to say this a bit more seriously,

513
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 our conventions won't, and that will make our conventions more risky, which I don't like for.

514
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 How much COVID did UK Games Expo have?

515
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 I don't know.

516
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 They had 10,000 people.

517
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 Yes.

518
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 That's quite a lot of people.

519
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 And it totally, listener to the show, Andrew January says that a lot of the people he knows who work on stands at the UK Games Expo got pinged.

520
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 If listeners have read about anyone who contracted COVID and thinks they contracted at the Games Expo, so please let us know.

521
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 Yeah, I was going to say, I think it's interesting.

522
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 There's probably a psychological effect of, "Please bring us your text message because, yes, you could forge it,

523
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 but then you have to make the deliberate act to basically say it's negative when it's not done, put it in the website and get text message."

524
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 I think that's a much higher barrier than just not doing your lateral flow because you think you feel a bit snotty.

525
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 I think your vaccinations, if you can, and test and bring us a thing is good.

526
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Yeah, the Octa Thought podcast endorses COVID vaccination.

527
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 It does.

528
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 I also wonder, what is it that you get out of being at a convention that you can do if you are masked at all times and keeping a social distance of a meter?

529
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 So, what way is that better than Zoom?

530
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 So, I think there are many people who prefer in-person things to Zoom.

531
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 Think about all the people who haven't been at the first Thursday's on Zoom, for instance, and imagine how much they'd rather have a first Thursday where everyone was masked and unvaccinated people were banned than they would a Zoom one.

532
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 Given that for them, the Zoom one means there isn't one versus there being one.

533
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 I think you and me are biased here in that we have spent an inorn out of time on Zoom.

534
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 I understand where you're coming from on that, but I also understand that there are people for whom that maths is very different.

535
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 Yeah, no, I'm not.

536
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 I don't think I'm, oh, we should have, what was it?

537
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 Lots of young people cram into tents and share vapes.

538
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Yeah, I don't think I want the Ted White room party of COVID policies.

539
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 I don't think it would be fine to say that if you can be vaccinated, you must be vaccinated, and if you cannot be vaccinated, it's not just because you have some personal conviction.

540
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 It's because you have a letter from a medical professional saying that in their medical decision, the risks of vaccination to you are too grateful to let it be happen.

541
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 I think it's fine to say masks in public places, but not for speakers, and I understand that there's a risk there.

542
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 I would recommend lateral flow twice before you go, and then once every 48 hours, if it's going on, so that would be my COVID policy in a nutshell, and open windows.

543
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 Can we all have lots of ventilation? Put a sweater on. It'll be November.

544
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 Yeah, probably about 12 sweaters on, I think.

545
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 As you know, I went to Washington, DC in November and it was perfectly fine, and I'm talking about core flu and Novocon, which I am going to rather than discount, which I was never ever going to.

546
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 So, because, I mean, I wouldn't fly. The notion that I get on an airplane. I'm sure airplanes are very safe.

547
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 Are you? Liz, tell us how safe airplanes are.

548
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 So, I mean, I'm not an expert in air ventilation, but from what I've read, they are actually quite safe because they do do a lot of air recirculation, actually.

549
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 I have seen a case which I think was where they traced the transmission to people going to the bathroom and taking their masks off, and then the next person using the bathroom and inhaling them.

550
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 But, I mean, I've got to be honest, I've been on several long haul flights. Every single person was wearing a mask apart from when they were eating.

551
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 There's not a lot of people on, especially the long haul flights at the moment, and so it felt fairly safe to me.

552
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Actually, it's not, I'm lying. It's got nothing to do with getting on a plane. It's got, I am not spending two hours in a US immigration queue.

553
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 It's that sort of encounter that I'm travelling in general contains risks that I find very difficult to mitigate.

554
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Well, it's lucky you don't want to do that, Alison, because they don't want you to, I don't.

555
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 I know they don't.

556
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 I don't.

557
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 But I'm pretty sure the most reckless thing I have done in the past week is to eat breakfast in Leon in Heathrow eternal too.

558
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 On the topic of Disc on three's COVID policy, another convention, as Liz, I think, mentioned that had a similar policy was convergence.

559
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 And File 7.7.7.7.7.8 did recently link to a Twitter thread in which they said there had been a COVID case in an attendee, but we believe that this has not led to any at-con transmission.

560
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 By which I mean, we haven't found anyone say it has and we feel that if it had done, someone would have said it did.

561
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 I think there were two people who tested positive after conventions, actually, because there's, I'll generally think there's two on their Facebook page.

562
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 One of whom thought they may have contracted it at the convention, but it doesn't look like it's been a widespread thing.

563
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 I mean, it's not like, you know, we're going to have a convergent strain of coronavirus, like you have the whisk on strain of noravirus or whatever.

564
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 Do we want to talk about Eastercon 2023?

565
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 Oh, yeah. No, it looks like I'm bidding for it with some friends.

566
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 Hey, do we want to introduce this better than that?

567
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 Or are we happy with that?

568
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 So, at Eastercon this year, I said to the convention that it might want to pause before seating Eastercon 2023 with Vanessa and her team and go and have a little think about it.

569
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 And as part of the process of having a little think about it, I am working on a bid with some friends.

570
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 I don't think we're quite ready to say who we all are and that we're announcing, but it's definitely a bid.

571
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 We had a proper meeting.

572
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 We're going off to some sites. We have a philosophy, which is that we're going to start to reach out to the Eastercon community and say, "Would you like Eastercon 2023 to look like?"

573
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 And we will try and deliver it for you.

574
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 And I hate to use the word "hybrid convention."

575
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 We are, I think, committed from the off to having both in person and virtual elements if we can.

576
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 And that is part of the structure and planning for this event that we think that we are, even in 2023, it is a racing certainty that some portion of our community would prefer to attend the convention online if that was an option for them.

577
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 So, that's part of the deal.

578
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 Yeah, more stuff coming soon.

579
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 Well, soonish.

580
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 I mean, I think we'll have a proper launch no later than Nevercon.

581
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Can you, is there anything else you can tell us, Alison, any tidbits that we might be able to exclusively reveal? Can you reveal the first letter of one of the people you're working with?

582
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 I'm boldness me.

583
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 So, that's Ellie.

584
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 So, yeah, no, it's, I think everyone's fine to talk names, but I don't think we're quite there yet.

585
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 We've got a team that covers, I guess, kind of site and access and comms and treasury and those sorts of things.

586
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 So, it's got the infrastructure stuff in place, but we don't really yet have a program lead.

587
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 So, if that's something you'd really, really like to do for these to come, get in touch.

588
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 Alison, can you reveal if you'll be having a traditional committee structure or some kind of wild anarchy?

589
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 No, it looks like we're going to have a chair who is Caroline Mullen and a set of people with roles.

590
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 And my role's probably going to be comms.

591
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 As you can see, I'm doing a great job at the moment.

592
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 But that's because we need things in place like social media accounts and websites and that sort of stuff.

593
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 And we haven't really.

594
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 Very important to have a website. I've been told.

595
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,040
 So, no, it has a traditional East

596
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:14,320
 Com structure. It's experienced people, but who are not all the same people that you've seen on East Com

597
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,440
 Committee before. Yeah, some of them are the same people you've seen on East Com

598
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,000
 Committee before, you know, what it's like.

599
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,840
 I'm really looking forward to your East Com

600
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,000
 2023, bit, Alison. I think it's going to be brilliant.

601
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 So, and we've had a chat with Vanessa. I think, oh, this is the thing I did want to say is that we've had a chat

602
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 with a visitor or Caroline, a chat with Vanessa. And we feel like we're, what we're doing is offering the

603
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,960
 East Com a couple of alternatives for what they want the

604
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:44,000
 commercial to look like. Because I think persistence is going for something slightly different.

605
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 Oh, yeah, and we have a name.

606
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 So, our name is conversation.

607
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 Oh.

608
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 Because I think when we were talking about Erl, and we're talking there about the thread of continuity,

609
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,560
 that if you're saying, well, you're not just putting on a show when you're on the East

610
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:10,000
 Com, you're actually building something for the community. What you're building is the opportunity to have those

611
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 conversations across the, across the community through time, all of that stuff.

612
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 That was two scoops. I'm happy with that. That's how many I get when I go to the

613
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 e-screen shop.

614
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 So, hopefully that's scoopy enough for you without me giving too much. Because we really don't have a lot yet.

615
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 We have like a vast pile of notes and thoughts.

616
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 [Music]

617
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 Before we end the podcast, we are going to talk about, well, sorry.

618
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 Before we end, the podcast is just a very quick plug for FutureCon 2021.

619
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 This is a YouTube based convention with items in a variety of time zones and with a variety of authors.

620
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 It's running on the weekend of the 3rd of September 2021. Allison and I, true to form, will be in the bar,

621
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 because we're going on a pub crawl listeners.

622
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 We'll be at a totally different bar.

623
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 Yeah. No. Well, we'll be in the same bar as one another.

624
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 Oh, I hope so. Yeah. Along with some other people.

625
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 If we're not something as compatible, we've been a bad pub crawl leader.

626
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 What is your feeling about like pub crawls? You know, does your pub crawl have the no man left behind ethos, John?

627
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 Yeah, better bloody half.

628
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 No man, woman or small fairy creature from the Crab Nebula.

629
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 I mean, I should mention that Claire and I have a kind of pub crawl ethos, which was typified by our Reading pub crawl,

630
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 where we crawl to one pub and then stop.

631
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 A single brewery.

632
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 And it's fine. Yes, I will try and go to some of future con because I like that it's not just authors, actually.

633
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 They've got some fans and they've got publishers, you know, an interesting looking panel on like small,

634
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 pest publishing around the world.

635
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 And they are incredibly international and show that by doing things in a, you know, many, suitable for many time zones.

636
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 And I think they'll all be on YouTube afterwards. So even if you are in the pub, you can catch up later.

637
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 There you go. That was my plug.

638
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 Good, good plug.

639
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 That was the 39th episode of the Octo-Thought Podcast and it's goodbye from me.

640
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 It's goodbye from me.

641
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 And it's goodbye from me.

642
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 [Music]

643
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 Now, I sold Alison at PlayStation 4 on the day that we did our live recording.

644
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 And so for the last two or three weeks, Alison has been exploring Horizon Zero Dawn, which is a game me and Liz like a lot.

645
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 Alison, do you like Horizon Zero Dawn?

646
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 It's stuck at the moment.

647
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 So I haven't actually played for a few days because I got stuck and then it needs a fair chunk of time to get unstuck.

648
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 I went down into a cauldron because I knew that there was it from the internet.

649
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
 There was a snap more at the bottom of it and I was like, I can deal with a snap more.

650
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 But it turned out to actually be a snap more under a ravager.

651
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 And my child is like, "Ah, no, ravagers, they're like bait. You just knock the cannon off their back so you pick up the cannon and you shoot everything."

652
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 And I'm like, "Yeah, no, I'm dead now."

653
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 So yeah, so I need to get better at Horizon Zero Dawn.

654
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 Horizon Zero Dawn is an open world game that's slightly less open world than you think it is.

655
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 I feel like there's always a very clearly defined thing that you should probably be doing next.

656
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 And if you're not doing it, then I mean, you can do things at different orders.

657
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 It's not that tied down.

658
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 But if you're not doing it, then you probably, it's quite easy to find yourself going off stray a bit.

659
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 But it's pretty good. It's very good.

660
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 PlayStation 4, quite nice.

661
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
 If anyone wants a second hand Blu-ray player, let me know.

662
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 Because...

663
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,000
 Yeah, as soon as you get a PlayStation, you do not need a standalone DVD or Blu-ray player anymore, which is good.

664
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 Because I was looking at my Blu-ray player and going, "Oh, that's not useful, is it?"

665
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 I've watched about three Blu-rays in the last year and it probably is slightly better than the BS4.

666
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 But it's also made by Sony, so it's probably exactly the same, really.

667
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 And if anyone would like a Blu-ray player, they should get in touch.

668
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 I kind of forgot to eat...

669
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 Horizon Zero Dawn is very pretty as well.

670
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 And it has a heroine that apparently people on the internet think is ugly because she doesn't...

671
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
 She's living in a post-apocalyptic spoiler.

672
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
 Post-apocalyptic world doesn't clearly have access to make up other than interesting forms of face paint.

673
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 But she does apparently have access to...

674
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 Or hairdressing, actually.

675
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
 She is still doing the obvious thing and cutting her hair short, she wears it in dreads.

676
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 She does apparently have access to eyebrow tweezers, which I find quite strange because she has extremely perfectly formed eyebrows.

677
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
 And I found this incredibly distracting, but otherwise.

678
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 I have extremely perfectly formed eyebrows and I do not block them, so she might just be very lucky.

679
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 Not like this, you don't.

680
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 There's a lot of criticism of Ayloy on the internet.

681
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
 I don't really understand it because I thought I really liked her as a character.

682
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 Yeah, she's great. She's apparently not the sort of video game lead character that 14 year old boys like.

683
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 That's the issue.

684
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:03,000
 I will also say I am quite spoiler-overse as many listeners may be aware, but I regard Horizon Zero Dawn being an post-apocalyptic future as on the cover of the video game and therefore not really.

685
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
 I think if it's on the cover of the video game it's not a spoiler.

686
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
 Okay, so should we talk about Palm Springs again?

687
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 I mean, I am aware that I am more spoiler-overse than many of the people I regularly converse with.

688
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 I don't always handle it well.

689
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 I don't think it's much of a spoiler to say that it's post-apocalyptic.

690
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:42,000
 I mean, you learn about three minutes into the game that there's giant robot dinosaurs and that there's kind of bits and pieces left over from the previous civilization.

691
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,000
 Yeah, I think that very first scene where she discovers her focus in the ruins is like if you don't...

692
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
 It's like one of the very first things in the game I think tells you pretty explicitly that it is.

693
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 So apologies for anyone who's playing it and hasn't.

694
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 Yeah, so Horizon Zero Dawn is very pretty. It's a very pretty game.

695
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 I took a screenshot and set it to John, so I will find it.

696
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 I mean, I had to implement photo mode.

697
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
 The photo mode thing is quite fun.

698
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 It is quite fun.

699
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 And Horizon Forgotten West is coming in six months time, so if there is another Hugo Award for Best Video Game, it will be eligible at the 2023 World Con.

700
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
 And we can talk about sequels.

701
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 Yeah, I was thinking much more depressingly.

702
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
 Like, I played Horizon Zero Dawn during like the first lockdown, so maybe in six months time we'll have another variant.

703
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 Another lockdown and I can play Horizon Forbidden West, obsessively for two weeks.

704
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 And that's where I'm going to end the episode and do the beat, please.

705
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
 On that happy note. So hurrah!
