00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 Hello everyone, it's John here, just to let you know there are some audio oddities on this episode

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,120
 due to circumstances beyond our control. I've tried to do the best I can to make things work well,

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
 but basically, Alison's track might sound a little different than what you're used to.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,720
 Hopefully it doesn't impede your enjoyment of our quality content. Onto the show!

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:42,080
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 76th episode of Octa Thought. This episode is coming

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:49,200
 to you on the 2nd of February 2023. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,640
 And today we have some letters of comment for you all and the first one is Tammy Coxon who says

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,000
 that she was all set to bring "If I ran the Zucon" to EasterCon for us, but you all went and bought

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,920
 it instead. But Liz, I believe you have some news on that front. Yeah, so what I have is a tab open

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,600
 to the page where I will buy a copy of "If they're ran the Zucon" and I just haven't got around to it.

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,640
 I've got a lot of tabs open to be fair. Liz's approach to life is just to have tabs open and

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,920
 hope by osmosis they will translate into action. Yeah, pretty much. No, I just keep opening tab

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
 and thinking I should do that and then doing something else is dead and not quite getting around to it.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:36,800
 That makes sense. That makes sense. I have too many tabs open by which I mean one, but I am going

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,480
 to action it. Is this a cue for me to send you a screenshot of all my tabs or definitely don't do

16
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,600
 that? It would probably make me sad but you can. I can use it as chapter art.

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,960
 Every so often my daughter walks by my iMac and helps press the little button that

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,120
 spreads all the windows across the screen and then laughs. Unfortunately, that doesn't actually

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:08,400
 expand all the tabs so you don't really get the full glory of why I need 32GB of RAM on my desktop.

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,960
 What I like about this is that it's basically like I could use my computer slightly differently

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,120
 or I could throw money at the problem and I respect that. Yeah, I mean, I feel like I'm

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,720
 old enough and absolutely there are certain sorts of things I'm not about to do differently.

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,920
 Fair enough. Liz doesn't have it yet but she will do when we record our filler episode probably.

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,040
 Yeah, I mean if we decide we're going to do an episode based around the zucan,

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
 ooh maybe that's foreshadowing, then I will just go and buy it.

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,520
 Yes, so but thank you very much, Terry, for your kind offer. I think if it wasn't available as a PDF,

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,680
 we would all enthusiastically take and carry up on on her offer but because it is available as a

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,320
 PDF, we are all internet gremlins. I mean I would accept that bringing a copy to

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,000
 EasterCon is spoiler alert. Not going to be useful to me either.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
 Liz.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:10,640
 Liz. It's a long way. I believe they have aircraft in the future.

32
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,120
 Oh yes now. We had a letter of comment from a listener called Liz Batty.

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,600
 Liz, do you want to read out the letter of comment from Liz?

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,240
 What?

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,760
 You've wrote us a letter of comment.

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
 About the future and date.

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,520
 Oh I did write your letter of comment about the future. Yes, the letter of comment to say was that

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,200
 while I proudly proclaimed on last episode that I was in the year 2565, I am actually in the year

39
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,720
 2566. No listeners noticed but it is basically like how you will habitually write 2022 for a

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,120
 few months after it's become 2023. It's like that, except worse.

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,600
 So when does the tie year flip over?

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,720
 Well first of January.

43
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,240
 Okay, interesting.

44
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,680
 Yeah they have big big big parties. Bangkok is one of the cities that we go to at the

45
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
 Zoom New Year party.

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,600
 Very nice.

47
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,520
 Because there's always lots of stuff going on.

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
 It's fireworks basically yeah.

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,600
 We also had some letters of comment from actual listeners.

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,640
 We also heard from Christopher J Garcia.

51
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,280
 Yay.

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,280
 He sent us a lock on episode 72-ish.

53
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,720
 Yep that's right, correct. Hold on Chris.

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,480
 I mean it is 72-ish.

55
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,920
 That is correct. If you said it was episode 72 you would have been wrong.

56
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,720
 Yeah and it also says they have haggis in a can.

57
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
 It's good. It's good stuff.

58
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,320
 I assume it's vegetarian haggis in a can.

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
 I don't know if it's vegetarian haggis in a can.

60
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
 It's got to be right because they're not allowed to meet you on because of the lungs.

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,640
 Well I think they are. They're just not allowed.

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,320
 It's not the lungs, it's the brains.

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,040
 And I think you can get haggis in American now.

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,960
 It's just not necessarily made to a traditional Scottish recipe.

65
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,200
 We're probably going into too much haggis at this point.

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,600
 One of my pals who is in California posted a picture of her child holding any

67
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
 enormous haggis which wasn't enormous meat haggis.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
 It may also be the brains but it is definitely the lungs.

69
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,240
 Lungs are illegal to eat in the United States of America.

70
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,280
 So anyway the point is that they're using different bits of sheep.

71
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,280
 I think British haggis may no longer have brains in this as well.

72
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
 Yeah I don't think it does.

73
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,240
 Yes I did it for it.

74
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,400
 Because I don't eat brain.

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
 Possibly more timely.

76
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
 Chris also mentioned that they were putting out another issue of

77
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,960
 journey planet about Chinese science fiction.

78
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,120
 Time to coincide with the Chinese New Year.

79
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,000
 Which is now out so we can link to that in the show notes.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,080
 That is the second part of the special on China.

81
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,240
 With a ton of interesting looking interviews and articles.

82
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,960
 Nice.

83
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,160
 Chris also says that he thinks there should be a smoughish RPG system based off gurps.

84
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,480
 And words cannot adequately express how much I disagree with that statement.

85
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,400
 So I'm not going to try but we can hash it out at a convention Chris.

86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
 I feel like that's a combat.

87
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,160
 Next time you should put these things on a little list.

88
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
 The next time you interview Chris for the podcast.

89
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,400
 We should actually have these topics as just have like topics in a barrel that we can pick

90
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
 out and talk about.

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,160
 It would be dreadfully unfair to ask Chris about things he said in the past.

92
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,120
 And Chris also says he brought a palette of board games.

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,840
 Yes.

94
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
 But and it was rubbish.

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,200
 I don't think my palette of board games would.

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,800
 Oh I mean my palette of board games probably would have been rubbish but it wouldn't necessarily be.

97
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,440
 That's I'm still a bit sad about the palette of board games.

98
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,240
 I've put it down as my when I have a future organized house so that I have like an entire

99
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,680
 spare room in which I could put a palette of board games for for for sifting and managing.

100
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,040
 Then then maybe I will.

101
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,280
 But obviously if I hadn't in to spare room and I started buying things like a palletons

102
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,840
 a bookcase I soon would not have an entire spare room.

103
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
 I'd have a room full of junk again.

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,320
 So you know.

105
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,680
 I wasn't going to say that.

106
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
 I know also like.

107
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,040
 So I'm glad someone else did.

108
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,120
 We also heard from Erwin Hirsch who asks whether Alison is moved house.

109
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,600
 Oh I haven't moved test but for shadowing I've been thinking a lot about the process of

110
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,440
 getting ready for the later part of your life over the last few weeks.

111
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,240
 And one of the things it struck me that is that at some point we're going to want to move

112
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,480
 house and when we do that we are not going to want to have a house full of rubbish that we don't

113
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,920
 use. We are trying to go through everything in our house keeping only the things that we need,

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:26,080
 use or love and getting rid of everything else.

115
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,440
 And when things don't satisfy one of those three categories I'm looking at them and going

116
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
 why am I keeping this?

117
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
 Also for shadowing.

118
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,800
 And also I would strongly recommend that a time when you absolutely don't have to move

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,040
 anytime in the next few years is a great time to do that because you wait till the time when

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,120
 you are moving really soon.

121
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,880
 You will do it much more effectively but it will also be way more stressful.

122
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,640
 Whereas it's not really stressful at all if you just do it bit by bit as you do it a lot.

123
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,280
 I'll let you know.

124
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,800
 And we've played about one percent of the rubbish in our house so far.

125
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,040
 There's a lot more to do.

126
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,640
 Yeah I think that's the thing.

127
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,400
 I was going to say no it's quite good to have some like a time deadline to focus the mind

128
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,080
 but I also think I have something like 10% of the amount of stuff you do so maybe less.

129
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
 Oh we should have a stuff off.

130
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
 That could be a filler episode.

131
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,560
 We're all on our phones and we all just count things like one thing to two things.

132
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,880
 I have way more stuff than either of you pretty sure but I also have way less stuff than some

133
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,320
 people I know.

134
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,560
 Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm just saying you know it's a lot more feasible to do everything and

135
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,560
 they're like oh I'm moving in three months I better get rid of a bunch of stuff when you have

136
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,840
 only 10% of the stuff.

137
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,920
 Oh I probably had like 20% of the stuff and I have 10% of the stuff and it's creeping slowly upwards again.

138
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,960
 Well the longer you live in the same house the more stuff you can be like.

139
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,400
 Yeah that is fair.

140
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,560
 And then finally we heard from Claire Breiley of Croydon who basically said

141
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,480
 "The legend that is Claire Breiley says her local bar."

142
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,760
 Says that the poem by Sandra was spectacular and the only things that were bad about it were

143
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,680
 me and Alison which is fair.

144
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,920
 Basically she says it could only have been improved by full-on performance accents from

145
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,640
 Alison and John and that that is true I did not do that I just tried to read it out.

146
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,480
 Basically I shot for acceptable rather than failing to achieve amazingness.

147
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
 I think Alison did better than me.

148
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:29,200
 I did go for what I went for was an accent that had some of the rhythms of Stanley Holloway without

149
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,400
 actually trying to do that in a way that would come over as a caricature so I don't know whether

150
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,880
 I managed it or not but anyway.

151
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,080
 I can't do accents.

152
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,640
 I feel my enjoyment would not have been improved by having you do comedy accents I'm just going to say.

153
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,760
 Well Liz and Liz is actually like extremely familiar with my comedy accents on account of how

154
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,280
 I used to use them when we played "I'll come home with a card game together" so

155
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:02,080
 Liz is familiar with the level to which they enhance your experience or not.

156
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
 *laughs*

157
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:17,360
 So we'd like to introduce you all to our regular segment of "Why is the Chengdu World concert a shower?"

158
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,600
 Is that all we have to say about Chengdu?

159
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,280
 For this week.

160
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,000
 There have been various reporting, I think Falstam and somebody has done some sterling work

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,120
 and Liz posted the images of the proposed museum in our chat.

162
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,000
 Liz do you want to talk about this first?

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 I can try and give an overview.

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,360
 So essentially we were saying last week how you know the Chengdu Worldcon had a few things they

165
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,200
 needed to do and it didn't appear that there had been any updates for ages and the website wasn't

166
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
 really very good and you could join and all this.

167
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,160
 Well they've solved at least one of these problems and they've solved it by entirely changing

168
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,400
 the date of the Worldcon and the site where the Worldcon will be held.

169
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,360
 Hey!

170
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,880
 So they sort of announced which I would just say solves the problem of the fact that site selection

171
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,440
 should open soon because that is tied to the date of the Worldcon and therefore it will now open

172
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,000
 and close later than originally intended.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
 But basically they sort of just put out like an announcement on Twitter saying by the way the

174
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,480
 Worldcon will now be in October the 18th of 22nd at the Chengdu Science Fiction Museum in

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,040
 Jingruong Lake, PD District Chengdu and we'll put some links to the pictures in the show notes but

176
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,080
 it looks like a fantastic building except that I have realized that all the fantastic building

177
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,440
 pictures are like those nice 3D renderings you get of buildings because they when they're like in

178
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,080
 the planning stages and that's because the new Chengdu Science Fiction Museum has not yet finished

179
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,960
 being built.

180
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,680
 On the other hand it does look like a spaceship I mean it looks amazing so if it actually looks

181
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,320
 like that in real life it will look well cool and possibly be one of the like the coolest venues

182
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,800
 for a Worldcon especially if it is like all in that one place.

183
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,880
 Narrator it wouldn't.

184
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,400
 So I have been told that the Chinese are extremely good at getting buildings up fast.

185
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,880
 I think it is interesting to see whether they will be able to achieve this.

186
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,720
 I mean so it'll be interesting because you know of course the the picture of the building has all

187
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,840
 the kind of landscaping and foliage back around the building which you know may not

188
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,760
 necessarily be all completely finished but I suspect if the building does not have

189
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,400
 anything like it looks on the renderings it will be nice.

190
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,240
 However does this mean it was a good idea to move the date and site?

191
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,440
 Well I guess if you're going to go to this new site and it's not actually built yet then you

192
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,840
 have to change the date but there's a further post on file 770 who've been doing a load of

193
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,520
 reporting on this so we're going to link to all their reporting where it sounds like it's not

194
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,360
 really clear kind of why this decision was made or who made this decision or kind of who in China

195
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,240
 is running things and so I think there's a bit of sort of general unhappiness there because

196
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,560
 this does I think move it out of the holidays for university students and so university students

197
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,640
 will have a much harder time arriving.

198
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,960
 So they announced that the dates and the site would be changed to this shiny new place.

199
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,400
 I did manage to find it on Google Maps eventually although it uh I will confess it took me a little

200
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,760
 while because I was using Google Maps and it turns out Google Maps is not very good in China and so

201
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,120
 if you didn't turn on the satellite view it just had some roads and then I turned on the satellite

202
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,800
 view and I think I found like a man-made lake where it is.

203
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,080
 I looked at a quick look at the hotels nearby and they do look you know super nice and the rates were

204
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,160
 super affordable.

205
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,320
 On the other hand it's not very clear because I don't know enough about the site how you get from

206
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,280
 the science fiction museum to the hotels and so on.

207
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,320
 I'm hoping there'll be like a lot more information put out.

208
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
 This is the sort of time when you want people to be planning ahead if they're going to come to your

209
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,200
 convention.

210
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,920
 That is currently difficult because China just reopened, most of the flights haven't restarted.

211
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,560
 I don't think it's actually possible to get a visa yet for tourism but if any of that does restart

212
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,920
 and they'd like people to go they probably do need to be saying things like this is where the

213
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,560
 hotel is.

214
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,040
 This is where the site actually is on a map.

215
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,200
 This is how you will get to between them.

216
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,240
 This is how you apply for a visa and whatever.

217
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,920
 If you need letters to be provided this is what we can do etc etc.

218
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,720
 Probably some of this the basic stuff that you would expect to be ready to go with your new site

219
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,640
 information is not there yet.

220
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
 So we'll see.

221
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,680
 And they also announced that they would be opening Hugo Award nominations soon

222
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,160
 and that you need to be a member of Chengdu Wokan as a WISFIS member in order to nominate if

223
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
 you're not already a member or a member of Shai Kahn.

224
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,880
 You can apparently now purchase a WISFIS member through their website with a credit card.

225
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,760
 We have not tried this because we all have memberships already but it has been verified by

226
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,520
 a friend of ours on Discord that you can apparently do this.

227
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,360
 This is not reusable information because if you haven't already joined by the time you listen to

228
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,120
 this podcast it will be too late to join and nominate but you will still be able to join and

229
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,840
 vote.

230
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,480
 Yes.

231
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,920
 I think it's particularly sad that students may not be able to go as it's the students who

232
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,720
 were responsible for getting the WorldCom for China.

233
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,920
 They really mobilized all the students, all the students, science fiction club

234
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,840
 and all the universities to get the vote out that was part of what they did.

235
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,160
 And they had lots of pictures on their website of like student clubs in different states.

236
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,200
 They bring the WorldCom to China and stuff like that and talking about how much, how excited they

237
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,320
 were to be going.

238
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,520
 So I think that's particularly sad.

239
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,760
 When it's interesting because last week we talked about how China can get the WorldCom

240
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,000
 wherever they, whenever they want.

241
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,840
 And what's really interesting is by doing this, the way they did that was by mobilizing their

242
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,880
 student vote.

243
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,200
 And the students like from what we can tell from peering into the Chinese internet,

244
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,920
 the students seem to be really really unhappy with this which is entirely

245
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,440
 understandable because it basically massively disenfranchises them because many of them won't

246
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,320
 be able to attend now, both from the perspective of it's at the wrong time of year for them and

247
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,560
 the location is much harder to get to.

248
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,200
 And so it's like, well, I don't understand, it just seems like a giant own goal from that

249
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,680
 perspective because, yeah, I don't know why you'd annoy the people who got you where you were.

250
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,440
 It's very strange because the tempting thing with this is to assume that they've done it for

251
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,480
 reasons that make sense to Chinese attendees but don't make sense to us.

252
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,360
 But like everything we're seeing from people who are Chinese attendees is also very annoyed.

253
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,480
 Well, I think it probably makes sense to the Chinese government and to support there

254
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,360
 and the Chengdu tourist board.

255
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,480
 And we know that the Chengdu tourist board was a big part of, so quite a lot of people involved

256
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,160
 in the bid were people who worked full time in the Chengdu tourist board or equivalent thereof,

257
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,760
 which is kind of a bit of government.

258
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,760
 And I don't pretend to know anything about how the Chinese government works.

259
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,560
 But there's clearly there is something which is semi-official about this team in a way that you

260
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,440
 wouldn't see normally for a well-come.

261
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,640
 But it could be even simpler.

262
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,000
 I mean, it could be that they had a plan to use a particular venue,

263
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,080
 which maybe would be quite expensive.

264
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,840
 If they're having difficulty getting sponsorship or indeed many members,

265
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,800
 and this venue was cheaper or they could do them a good deal because it's a great

266
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,400
 cross promotion with the science fiction museum, maybe kind of for financial reasons,

267
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,200
 they had to go for it.

268
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,280
 I mean, I think the thing is we don't really know and we probably will never find out,

269
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,400
 except, you know, maybe in five years time a smuff con, you know, we'll find it all out on

270
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
 a panel or in the bar.

271
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
 But yeah, there could be lots of reasons.

272
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,520
 It's just since we don't know, we kind of are free to make up any reason we like.

273
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,720
 So it doesn't seem to have been a choice made because the attendees wanted them to.

274
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,600
 So we know at least that there is something funky going on somewhere,

275
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,760
 because it's not like DC where they were like, we can have it in August,

276
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,200
 but if we move to December, we might be able to have more of an in-person convention

277
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
 and like they asked the members.

278
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,760
 Like it definitely isn't coming from the members.

279
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,000
 Oh yeah, it's definitely not a case, you know, like for, you know, DC did,

280
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,720
 I think everything they could where they went and surveyed the members and said,

281
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,160
 okay, what difference would this make to you?

282
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,920
 You know, what would you like to say?

283
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,080
 But I think it's also, you know, just because of the various translation barriers,

284
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,800
 we're probably only ever hearing from a subset of the membership.

285
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,880
 And I think nearly everything that Will Kahn does,

286
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,240
 you'll be able to find a subset of the membership who disliked the decision.

287
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,680
 I'm sure, speaking, you'll be able to find a subset of the opt-of-for team

288
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,440
 who disliked the decisions, you know.

289
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,800
 Yes, that may be true.

290
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,840
 But yeah, it does seem like, you know, they had a lot of, you know,

291
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,040
 it is a big issue if you had a lot of support from students who essentially have invested a bunch

292
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,400
 of money in and get themselves to get themselves set up for voting at discount

293
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,840
 and now can't attend.

294
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,040
 And I don't know if you can transfer a Chengdu membership,

295
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,720
 but we know you can't transfer Wispers memberships anymore, right?

296
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,480
 They probably can't transfer their membership to someone else and recoup much of the cost.

297
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,240
 Yeah, I mean, it is worth noting that you can't transfer a Wispers membership,

298
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,200
 but you also can't buy a membership that doesn't include Wispers membership,

299
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
 except of course, you can for Chengdu.

300
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,160
 So if Chengdu wanted to, they'd just do it and hang it all,

301
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,800
 which is like, I do, like, which is not necessarily me criticising Chengdu,

302
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:22,000
 is a observation of the facts of how Chengdu and the Wispers constitution are so far into intersecting.

303
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,120
 While we are talking about memberships, though,

304
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,240
 so the Chinese students have attending memberships of the WorldCom

305
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,160
 because they were supporting and voting members of Discon.

306
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,960
 Now, although I don't think there's any doubt about whether they were individual voters,

307
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,160
 I think it's very clear that they were, which is partly why they're angry at.

308
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,320
 I'm not convinced they paid for their memberships.

309
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,120
 I think that was all coming from a central block of money,

310
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,880
 which as we know, the Wispers rules do not forbid.

311
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,840
 So they may be upset that they have their attending memberships and may not be able to use them,

312
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,760
 but I don't think they necessarily pay for them or many of them pay for them.

313
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,960
 So, you know, I want to talk a little bit about the architecture.

314
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,880
 This is a very exciting statement building.

315
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,280
 You know, it's indeed building. There aren't that many of them still.

316
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,480
 It does look as if it's being built just for the WorldCom.

317
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,120
 So just kind of as a prestige building that is kicked off by the WorldCom

318
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,160
 in the way that you might get for a World's Fair or the Great Exhibition or something like that.

319
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,440
 This is pretty exciting stuff for the WorldCom to be involved in.

320
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,040
 It's kind of strange and not the sorts of things we normally do.

321
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,400
 Normally we are in hotels that have been around for a very long time,

322
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,360
 or conference centers, where we are just one visitor amongst many.

323
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,960
 I think that's quite strange.

324
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,600
 I mean, when you say "built for the WorldCom", you mean it exists and it will host a WorldCom

325
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,120
 as one of its first events.

326
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,080
 No, I don't think so. I think it has been built for the WorldCom.

327
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,880
 Because they've named the buildings after Wispersmarks.

328
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:02,240
 So no, I think it's much closer to the Olympic Park mode than it is to a...

329
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,840
 I mean, I might be wrong.

330
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,000
 Yeah, I think this is an Olympic Park model.

331
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,320
 Where do we get that information from?

332
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,720
 Because I think if there's something written in Chinese and we translate it

333
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,480
 and it says Hugo Awards Theatre, it doesn't necessarily mean the theatre

334
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
 is being named for the Hugo Awards.

335
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,080
 That makes sense.

336
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,040
 The fact that the mock-up of the building in one of the File 770 awards

337
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,480
 has a massive sign on the side saying Hugo Award.

338
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,120
 Yeah.

339
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,040
 Oh, I text your daily, this is.

340
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,160
 Yeah, but if I go to a convention, it's got usually, you know,

341
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,240
 going to have a great big sign up and things.

342
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
 So I don't know.

343
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,040
 I think it would be interesting to see what we get.

344
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,920
 But they never...

345
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,200
 I've never been to a convention where they've taken down the sign that says

346
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,400
 Excel and replaced it with a sign that says Hugo Awards.

347
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
 I've been to one where they've got a banner, but this doesn't look like a banner.

348
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,920
 This looks like it's on the building.

349
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,720
 Yeah, I think...

350
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,200
 I don't know.

351
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,240
 I think we're reading a lot into a very small thing on the building,

352
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,120
 which could potentially be temporary signage for the WorldCom.

353
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,000
 So I don't know if this is going to be actually branded after WorldCom service mark.

354
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
 Sorry, it was for service mucks.

355
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,600
 Certainly, if I was going to bet money, and I'm not,

356
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,480
 but if I was going to bet money, the way it is described does not seem like it's temporary.

357
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,560
 And it may be, it may be that every time this comes up and all of the renderings

358
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,120
 are just, I'm getting the wrong end of the stick,

359
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,240
 but all of the text and all of the renderings are very much designed

360
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
 to get me to pull that end of that stick.

361
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,280
 And it might be that that isn't what they're doing.

362
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,360
 But I would quite like to know that for sure.

363
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,680
 And if they are doing it, it is a giant enough problem

364
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,560
 that I feel like me stay in my opposition to it early and often is probably good.

365
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,880
 I absolutely do not think they should be using these marks in this way.

366
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,040
 And if it's not clear, I think it's quite cool.

367
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,960
 I think it's quite cool.

368
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,960
 And I think you could probably do it in a way that did not use the mark.

369
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,920
 You should work with the Mark Protection Committee to find a way of saying,

370
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,920
 "Oh, this is a building that has been created to hold the world con,

371
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,600
 and then will go on to be Chengdu's Science Fiction Museum."

372
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,880
 I think that's completely cool.

373
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,720
 And they should find a way with the Mark Protection Committee

374
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,120
 to celebrate the fact that it held the world con as its first event,

375
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,160
 provided it's still not a building site, which of course it might be.

376
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,640
 Great.

377
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,960
 I think that if the Chinese government or the Chengdu tourist board

378
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,440
 or whoever has made this decision has basically decided to appropriate our marks

379
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,400
 in order to drive tourism to the area that is crappy.

380
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,480
 And I think if it was not, I think if it was a US state doing this,

381
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,680
 you'd be up in arms.

382
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,760
 So I think that is a bit of a double standard.

383
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,960
 I think, no, I think I could 100% get behind it.

384
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,480
 The trick is finding marks right.

385
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,120
 So you basically say it's the 2023 World Science Fiction Convention building,

386
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,840
 like the Royal Festival Hall.

387
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,600
 Well, no, because China is currently not doing it by asking permission.

388
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,520
 I tell them to get on to the Mark Protection Committee,

389
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,800
 which I think they should be doing.

390
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,840
 Don't get me wrong.

391
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,880
 I'm sure they are.

392
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,000
 I'm not sure they are.

393
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,720
 Wish not.

394
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,280
 If you're on the Mark Protection Committee, you should get in touch.

395
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,360
 The Mark Protection Committee learned about this when it was released in Fall 770.

396
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,640
 I know this for a fact.

397
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,160
 Well, I think everyone learned about this when it was released in Fall 770.

398
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,480
 Yes.

399
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,440
 And so this partly links to the whole thing about copyright in China.

400
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,960
 Which is quite a big deal.

401
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,560
 And eventually, eventually, people probably get sorted out,

402
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,120
 but hasn't been yet, which is that there really isn't any.

403
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,920
 So that makes everything, you know, we talk about our understanding of

404
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,520
 intellectual property and property marks and Chinese artists and designers and manufacturers.

405
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,000
 And everybody really is like, well, that's very interesting,

406
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
 but that's not how we do it in China.

407
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,880
 I hope Liz is right and I'm reading too much into it.

408
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,920
 I just at the moment, it doesn't seem like there's any,

409
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,320
 I don't know, everything seems to be leaning in the same direction.

410
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
 Yeah, that also means, of course, that

411
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,480
 I'm locked, so to apply in China because China has no copyright law in the way that you think of it.

412
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,600
 It feels like it's a thing that's certainly worth the Mark Protection Committee going,

413
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,160
 hang on, I did you think about talking to us, but I also wonder, you know,

414
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,960
 we have said how like, it looks amazing in the rendering,

415
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,160
 but the rendering also seems to have drones everywhere shooting the

416
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,400
 material blue glow into the sky.

417
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,880
 You know, I wonder if the person who is in charge of making some nice 3D models

418
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,120
 got excited and looked at a website.

419
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,280
 I think it's worth like doing that, but maybe waiting to see what it actually does look like

420
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,520
 when it's constructed and seeing.

421
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,920
 If they constructed without on it, that's staying there.

422
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,640
 The point is to make sure that our opinions on this are known before that point, not after.

423
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
 Oh, I just don't think that'll make any difference, so.

424
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,920
 Well, maybe not.

425
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,000
 I mean, but nothing we, I mean, in that case, we might as well wrap the podcast up, right?

426
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
 Because we're just talking, I don't have any power.

427
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,080
 I don't have like a link to the Communist Party to register my complaints.

428
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
 We're just talking about our opinions.

429
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,880
 It's, let's not pull on the thread off, does it matter what we think?

430
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,800
 I know, I know, I know, but I'm saying, you know, I don't really see whether, you know,

431
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,520
 if we disagree with it now, or if we disagree with it in eight months time,

432
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,480
 I don't think it'll make really a lot of difference.

433
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,440
 I just think we haven't really seen what it's actually going to look like,

434
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,200
 and it's worth investigating.

435
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,800
 I'm not too fussed about some 3D renderings at this point.

436
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,320
 I mean, we started this segment saying, you know, well, the rendering's look very nice,

437
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,280
 but, you know, the actual museum may look completely not like that when we get there.

438
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,680
 I think they look like us as renderings of a building, and my experience is that

439
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,760
 the actual building in real life really, really matches the artist's pictures in beautiful 3D

440
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,480
 renderings.

441
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,960
 But the main structure has been topped out.

442
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,720
 It looks like it might happen.

443
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,680
 That looks like...

444
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,920
 Oh, it could, like, yeah, no, it could well.

445
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,120
 How many months has worked?

446
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,560
 Not that... eight months?

447
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,440
 Nine months.

448
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,960
 So, that's a segue onto Alison's guff trip.

449
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,440
 It is, it is.

450
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,880
 So, last time you shared news of your guff trip with us, Alison,

451
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,640
 you were planning to go after King Charles the Third's Coronation,

452
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,440
 but that changed, and then Chengdu changed.

453
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,040
 It was, I was trying to free the country the day after the coronation,

454
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,080
 because the Australian nap con is happening.

455
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,720
 I understand.

456
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,520
 It still doesn't have anything that you could describe as a website,

457
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,680
 but I believe that the nap con is,

458
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:18,560
 conflicts will be happening in person from 29th of September, first of October,

459
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,520
 I think, in the dates.

460
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,640
 And we've had some confirmation of that from people.

461
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,280
 And so, as there is an Australian national convention happening this year in Australia,

462
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,000
 I feel like my guff trip needs to go inside with it.

463
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,880
 So, that is what we are currently planning.

464
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,400
 I'm still doing the previous plan, which is to fly to Perth,

465
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,760
 travel west to east across Australia, go to the Lacon,

466
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,920
 then go to New Zealand, visit at least Wellington and probably also Auckland,

467
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,440
 and then fly home.

468
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:54,800
 But it is not impossible that I could fly home via Chengdu for the Worldcon,

469
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,240
 which is 18th, 22nd of October.

470
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,760
 So, we're thinking about it.

471
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,400
 And I think all the things that Liz has said about not actually having the ability

472
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,480
 to book flights, it not being anywhere very convenient even in Chengdu,

473
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,160
 it being impossible to get visas and so on,

474
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,120
 probably will put pages this scheme because I probably will want to have my flights booked

475
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,080
 before those things become clear.

476
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,920
 But I might just book some of the other flights and leave it open.

477
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,560
 I don't know.

478
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,720
 I am getting help with flight booking from Clare Brawley,

479
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,520
 who is very good at flight booking because flight booking gives me the most hideous

480
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,280
 heebie-jeebies of anxiety.

481
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,080
 And I am very worried that about the whole business of booking a complicated

482
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
 itinerary, it seems impossible to me.

483
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,480
 But you know, so theoretically, I could go to China on my

484
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,280
 duff trip, which would be kind of wild.

485
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,720
 But yeah, if not, I'd like to come to Bangkok, please Liz and see you.

486
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,640
 Well, if I want to go to China.

487
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,960
 Oh, Liz, are you going to China?

488
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
 I mean, probably not.

489
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,440
 But again, it's like one of those things where currently it is impossible to plan.

490
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,160
 And so I can say, no, I'm not going.

491
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,280
 It's impossible to plan.

492
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,000
 If it becomes suddenly possible, then I might have to rethink it,

493
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,480
 depending on whether we actually see a picture of the building or whether it looked cool.

494
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,080
 No, I mean, it very much depends, doesn't it?

495
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,080
 I mean, I suspect, just for this, has benefited that there is absolutely no sensible

496
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,040
 routing from the UK to Australia, which goes directly via Chengdu.

497
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,120
 You'll have to do it as a side trip anyway.

498
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,040
 Yeah, I suspect it won't be part unless you want to book a trip with a kind of

499
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,360
 wobbly date or with a massive layout of somewhere.

500
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,720
 I don't think it will work, but I guess it's theoretically possible.

501
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,160
 So then it's time for Bangkok instead.

502
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,960
 Yeah, it is a possible stopover.

503
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,360
 Again, it may not be the most sensible stopover given current, you know,

504
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
 state of the flights in the world and so on.

505
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,280
 So I think you'll have to see.

506
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,800
 There's you two reasonable.

507
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,480
 Yeah, so my decisions get slightly different here, because although, obviously,

508
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,120
 I have a duty to spend the guff money carefully.

509
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,920
 It is the guff money and it's the sort of thing that might be quite exciting for the

510
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,120
 fanf... you know, so it's an exciting opportunity for the fanfants.

511
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,560
 So it's not ludicrous.

512
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,440
 To segue from guff to talking more generally about fanfants,

513
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:23,760
 in 2007, there was a one-off fanfant that sent Chris O'Shea to the Worldcon in Japan.

514
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:32,080
 Does anyone know if there is a Chinese equivalent being planned for 2023?

515
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,320
 I have not heard anything about one.

516
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,920
 I think it would be a lovely idea.

517
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,040
 I'm not personally going to get involved in it for reasons.

518
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:47,120
 That's fair, because it's a lot of effort and you've got another fanfant to administer and run and dig do.

519
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,000
 And I'm on the East Concomacy, which is the exact time when you would want to get this ready.

520
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,160
 And have my life been citing this year?

521
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,200
 So, you know...

522
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,960
 That, yeah, no, those are all very fair comments.

523
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,400
 So I think it would be a lovely idea.

524
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,880
 If you're out there in podcast land and you don't have enough

525
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,080
 fanak at the moment, then this would be a great thing to set up.

526
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,240
 Also, Chris O'Shea, where's your trip report?

527
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,160
 Just saying.

528
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,440
 I guess it's a nice idea, but I think you will not meet with great enthusiasm and also

529
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,440
 like it's again very difficult to plan things when you don't know who will actually be able to go.

530
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,600
 So I suspect there's not going to happen.

531
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,640
 No, yeah, I mean, I'm not saying.

532
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,080
 Yeah, I just say, I think even if you aren't used to asking about running it, I will, you know,

533
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:44,000
 get some, you know, try and take the general temperature of fandom for, you know, giving money for that.

534
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,320
 They might be like, eh, nah.

535
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,040
 Maybe then we could have the fanfant theatre.

536
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,920
 Is that a trademark?

537
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,080
 No, fanfants you can do whatever you like with.

538
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,320
 Right, so we don't have any trademarks.

539
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,760
 I mean, there's customer practice.

540
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,880
 So you have the TAF room and the Gough room and the Dough room.

541
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,400
 The Gough room would be very smelly.

542
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:07,200
 Wouldn't it all be a confusing way to name like your function rooms?

543
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:15,920
 Okay, fix fix. Do you want to go first, John?

544
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,760
 Yeah, I'm very rarely go first. This is a treat.

545
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,920
 About probably two years ago or so, I started trying to watch a movie every week with my

546
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,120
 darling wife because I'm not actually very good at wanting to watch movies.

547
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,440
 And my wife very much loves movies.

548
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,880
 And so I was like, ah, how I kill you need to make an effort and watch more movies.

549
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,240
 And so I've been watching a movie a week.

550
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,720
 Yeah, like I say, for probably about the last two or three years.

551
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,240
 And that's been very good.

552
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,720
 And obviously at the end of December, beginning of January, you start watching the movies.

553
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,480
 You didn't watch from the previous year that you think might be on the Hugo Ballot and other things.

554
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,920
 And so with a view to this, we watched Pray.

555
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,280
 Pray is the latest entry in the Predator franchise.

556
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,680
 And it is really good.

557
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:09,440
 It is a movie which understands what made the first Predator a good movie,

558
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,480
 which is lovely.

559
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,920
 The other thing it does very interestingly is it twists the narrative.

560
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,480
 So in the original, it's Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers.

561
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,160
 It's kind of good, but it's kind of very, it's a very surface level film.

562
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,400
 There's the alien and there's two very burly men and the burly men have guns.

563
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,760
 And let's see what happens.

564
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:35,760
 This one is a native American woman who wants to be seen as a hunter by her tribe.

565
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,080
 And she is the kind of main protagonist of the movie.

566
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,240
 And so it kind of uses all the things the original Predator did very well.

567
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,240
 But it kind of layers on top of that a commentary about colonization and about

568
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,560
 sort of the hunter's relationship to the Pray.

569
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,080
 And it's very interesting in that sense in a way that I don't think the original movie is.

570
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,560
 And so I actually think this is probably better than the original Predator by quite a way.

571
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,520
 I really enjoyed it.

572
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,480
 I thought it was very, very good.

573
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,680
 And yeah, I highly enjoyed watching it.

574
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,720
 I would recommend it.

575
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,320
 It is on Disney Plus.

576
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,200
 Probably not for Liz, but for most of our listeners.

577
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,880
 No, it isn't Disney Plus for me.

578
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,320
 Well, it's on Hotstar Disney.

579
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,960
 It's just a very tight, just a very tight movie.

580
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,760
 Everything, everything was there because it needed to be there for something to happen.

581
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,520
 And that was, I like that kind of movie.

582
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,960
 I'm going to do a sticky second pick.

583
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,680
 We also watched last night Invasion of the Body Snatchers,

584
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,200
 which is a movie from 1956.

585
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,560
 Googles.

586
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,240
 Did you like it?

587
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
 Yes, it's Bloody Brilliant.

588
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,000
 I don't know if anyone here has seen Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

589
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,520
 But yeah, no, it's really, really good.

590
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,040
 Firstly, it has more than one woman in, and I don't just mean two women.

591
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,080
 Like there's loads of them.

592
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,320
 Admittedly, I don't think it passes the Bechtel test, but it was 1956.

593
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,680
 So, but it's kind of, it's just incredibly tense.

594
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,680
 And all of the characters do things that you can imagine those characters might do in that situation.

595
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,840
 And like, it's just so good.

596
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,760
 And very much better than a lot of movies I've seen from

597
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,920
 the list of classic genre movies we are working our way down.

598
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,280
 This one really holds up.

599
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,640
 So I enjoyed it greatly.

600
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,360
 That's really good.

601
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,800
 Films.

602
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,720
 Yeah, films are good.

603
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,240
 So, I'll be putting prey on my list for the hugos.

604
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,640
 Yeah, we are going to talk about the things we're putting on our hugo list.

605
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,760
 Some point, but not this week.

606
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,200
 Nope.

607
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,000
 All right.

608
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,360
 Liz, do you want to go next?

609
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,000
 Um, I don't know if I really have a pic.

610
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,440
 Should we just let you have two?

611
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,120
 So is that not in the spirit of things?

612
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,320
 That's it.

613
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,400
 I mean, should we just go with John's second pic as being a pic?

614
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,320
 What I should have done is picked for you and made you talk about

615
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,400
 invasion of the body snatches, having potentially not seen it or not seen it recently.

616
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,760
 Yeah, that would have been quite funny because you have indeed not seen it.

617
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,640
 It's really good, Liz.

618
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,600
 I highly recommend.

619
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,920
 I feel like I saw it about 35 years ago,

620
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,320
 but I was thinking about another film I saw about 35 years ago.

621
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,800
 And I could literally remember two things about it, which was that

622
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,520
 it had a submarine and somebody had a beard.

623
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,640
 Home from red October.

624
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,920
 Home from red October?

625
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,400
 Correct.

626
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,600
 This could be a game show at a convention.

627
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,480
 People give clues to movies using like the least information they possibly can.

628
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,280
 I mean, it is one of those games where you give the least information you possibly can,

629
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,760
 and you get points for everyone who gets it right.

630
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,600
 But you lose points if everyone gets it right or whatever.

631
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,960
 Dixit, which has the mechanic where if nobody gets it, you don't do well.

632
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,720
 And if everybody gets it, you don't do well, you have to be somewhere in the middle.

633
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,320
 Have you played Dixit, Liz?

634
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,680
 I have played Dixit, I think.

635
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,720
 One.

636
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,560
 It's not a lot.

637
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,760
 Someone invented a version of this that's like the Elon Musk game,

638
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,440
 where you're all trying to like come up with an invention and you all know what it is.

639
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,320
 I have to find this, but there was definitely like an Elon Musk game that was very funny

640
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,000
 that someone invented on Twitter.

641
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,560
 Hang on.

642
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,080
 I'm pretty sure I've got it on my computer somewhere.

643
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,800
 Put it on Discord somewhere, let's make them find it.

644
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,480
 Sadly, there's a lot of things for Elon Musk being rubbish.

645
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,240
 That probably segues quite nicely into her.

646
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,480
 So my pick.

647
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,000
 So I have to say this in a way that's not going to generate a vast number of

648
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,480
 sellers.

649
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,920
 Don't write, guys.

650
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,680
 My mother died last week.

651
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,680
 So, and this has kind of been in train for a little while.

652
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,240
 So I've had a bit of a torrid time so far into 23, but hopefully it will start to get better now.

653
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,880
 And one of the things I've done to deal with this is engage in a lot of

654
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,880
 sorting behavior and craft projects and things of that kind.

655
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,480
 And I have discovered prints and play games and they're amazing.

656
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,520
 Who knew?

657
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,240
 And it turns out that you, so the idea is that people who want to sell the games cheaply

658
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,920
 or who are prototyping games that might not be in a finished form,

659
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,360
 or who just like to do a lot of games far more than you could ever ship through real publishers,

660
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,960
 like to release print and play games, either for free or for bobbins.

661
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:16,000
 And then you at home cut them and stick them out and stick them together and play your games.

662
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,240
 And it turns out I really like them.

663
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,640
 I like both, I like two different sorts of these.

664
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,960
 I like the ones that you, actually, if you're me, have to print anything at all,

665
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,160
 because you can play them entirely on your iPad, because they are designed as kind of

666
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,840
 rolling writers in a typical game where you roll dice and then mark things off on a

667
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,000
 game sheet, having rolled them.

668
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,360
 And I have played dozens of these and some of them are amazing.

669
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,000
 And some of them are terrible.

670
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,160
 And a lot of them are kind of somewhere in the middle.

671
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,720
 And then you also get games where you do actually have to cut out and stick together

672
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,240
 stuff. And it turns out that I really like that kind of cutting out stuff.

673
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,440
 There's a rabbit hole here.

674
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,320
 Many, I think rabbit hole is a small thing.

675
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,880
 They're kind of like great big kangaroo holes, where you have these,

676
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:13,760
 you can spend an enormous amount of money printing and cutting out and making decks of cards,

677
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,000
 where you work out how to make them as close as possible to real cards.

678
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,960
 If this is you, then you probably just need to buy ball games.

679
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,720
 But what I'm doing at the moment is making fairly cheap sets of printed play games,

680
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,280
 and then saying, well, if I play them a certain number of times,

681
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,160
 I will then go and buy the actual box set.

682
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,760
 Well, some games I really like.

683
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,040
 I like a game called Polyhedral Park Planner, which I think John recommended to me,

684
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,320
 which is a game where you...

685
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,880
 I did.

686
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,240
 You have a...

687
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,800
 There is a convention happening in your city.

688
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,680
 Your Chengdu, say, and you have been charged with making a park that has an extremely beautiful,

689
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,520
 I don't know, convention hotel in the middle of it, and you have to put other park elements

690
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,640
 around your game.

691
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,760
 And I like this one because it is a sort of game where you can have

692
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,600
 numerous players, and they all play with exactly the same board and exactly the same dice rolls,

693
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,320
 and nevertheless make completely different games and parks out of it.

694
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,160
 And then you will compare your parks at the end and go,

695
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,440
 "Ooh, that's interesting." And also, "Ooh, Jonathan is one because Jonathan is better at working out

696
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,280
 how to do this than everybody else or whatever."

697
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,120
 And for those ones, you don't even have to have friends because you can put the die rolls in a

698
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,040
 list behind a spoiler tag on a website, and then people can go and all play the same one and

699
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,600
 compare them.

700
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,160
 So, you know, all you could just play on your own because there are solo rules, and this is great.

701
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:40,560
 And another game I really like is in this one, is one called Chronicles of Stampedeo, where

702
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,240
 somebody on the website is procedurally generating a dungeon for you to explore every day.

703
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,760
 And there's a little bit of legacy because some of the things that you do on one day

704
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,360
 will have an effect on the following day, which is, I mean, quite like even more of that.

705
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:59,360
 I kind of look at that game and go, "Ooh, you could really lean into that much more with a roguelike

706
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:05,440
 that it's a board game or it's a rolling right, but you could actually have lots of legacy material

707
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,040
 working on the website.

708
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,360
 There's nobody's making any money, so who knows?

709
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,200
 There's only so much you can do without making money.

710
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,320
 And then in the print and plays, another game John recommended in a very thoughtful way

711
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:23,760
 is a solo journaling role-playing game, which is called Why the F Star, Star, Star,

712
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,760
 did they keep this? Where you journal and develop a story of why your imaginary relative

713
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,200
 kept a load of junk in the house.

714
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,200
 And that's cutting a bit close to the bone at the moment, but it's still a very interesting game.

715
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,960
 And today I discovered that they've got a competition,

716
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,600
 "Borgame Geek", which is a website full of board games, has a competition at the moment

717
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:52,080
 for in-hand games that I don't know, I understand that this tabletop gaming covers both

718
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:58,960
 games, role-playing games and board games, and even some sterility games like Caram and things like that.

719
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,280
 And those games are all played on tables, but in-hand games don't even need a table,

720
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,120
 and I'm not sure their technique is covered, but anyway, so I've now tried playing it,

721
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,720
 cutting up and making in-hand games, which can actually play E.G. in the car, if you're stuck on a

722
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,360
 very long and boring car journey. You can be making and playing little games, and this one is called

723
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,720
 Galdor's Grip, which I think is a great name for a game that you play in your hand all of the time.

724
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,200
 I didn't want to pick, I mentioned some particular car, but this really is a pick about how the

725
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,360
 entire hobby is amazing, and if you are a complete cheapskate, you do not need to spend any money

726
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,720
 at all, apart from obviously on your iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. Obviously it supports more gamers,

727
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,400
 so you can often buy these games for the price of a cup of coffee, some of them are demos

728
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,280
 for games that you can actually go and buy, and this is a good way of finding out and learning

729
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,720
 a lot about what sorts of games you like, because if you play a load of different sorts of game

730
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,120
 genres for not very much money and in not very much time, it's very easy to work out what sorts

731
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,960
 of things you like and what sorts of things you do not like. Print-of-play games, they're awesome.

732
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:12,400
 I would just like to note that I suggested that game before Alison's mother died. I didn't hear

733
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,120
 the news and be like, "This journey game is for you." To be fair, he suggested that game

734
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:24,720
 while we were pet clearing out my parents' house, so you know. Yeah, well that I think is just

735
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,840
 well alright, Ferra. Yeah, but you're also clearing out your own house, so yeah, and I'm also clearing

736
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,960
 out my own house. I want everything in my house to be something that somebody could pick up and go,

737
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:42,160
 "Oh, I know exactly why there are 38 Prince and Play games in little jiffy bags here, it's because

738
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,120
 Mum went through this really difficult patch after her own mother died and she just made a

739
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,400
 Prince and Play game every day for a bump and then stopped. Now I'm just wondering, "Are you going to

740
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,160
 kick these forever or are you actually going through them and getting rid of the ones you

741
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,680
 pin out and stick together and realise you don't actually like very much or will not play again?"

742
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:10,400
 I haven't yet, but what I'm going to do is say, "Here's like a batch," right, and compared with big box

743
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:18,240
 games, I have to, that was a visual clue, sorry for everybody, on the odd cast, but I'm typically

744
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:26,640
 putting them into a A6 size bag and that's enough for like a deck of cards and the rules and a

745
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,400
 sticky label and they don't take up very much space. One of the things that's actually discouraged me

746
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,600
 from giving some of these game designers money is that I have my tiny little Prince and Play game

747
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,240
 and I go, "Oh, but there's a box game of this," and then I look at the size of the box game and I go,

748
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,960
 "Oh, why are they not selling me a game in a box?" I mean, I know the game economics are really

749
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,280
 complicated, but I do like tiny games. You're much more likely to sell your game if it's small in general.

750
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,000
 That's fair. I mean, Prince and Play games are a good.

751
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,080
 No, no, no, some of them are excitable.

752
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,040
 Oh, well that's true.

753
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,200
 I think we should clear here. I've played some absolutely appalling games, really

754
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,320
 hardly function of games in it, but that's, I still quite like it. I like a lot of

755
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,080
 bad hobby where you can just play loads and loads and loads of different games.

756
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,840
 It's like listening to music, some of the music you listen to will be terrible as well if you

757
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,000
 listen to lots of different music, but it doesn't mean that listening to lots of different music isn't

758
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,920
 fun. And also there's somewhere, there's even one where I've paid money for. I'm not going to name

759
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,000
 it, but every time I look at the files and think about the amount of work that would have to be done

760
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,600
 to actually get it to the point where I understood the rule set and was playing it.

761
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,240
 I go, oh no, maybe I could just play a really short one instead.

762
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:51,040
 I think I might be wrong, Liz. I found Steve Dee's game from 2018, which is called Elon Musk's

763
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,800
 iPod submarine, where one player secretly writes down a terrible problem the world is facing

764
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,720
 and they have to sum it up in six worlds or left. You write this problem on all the pieces of paper

765
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,040
 except one and on the one that you don't write on, you just write Elon Musk. And then you put all

766
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,680
 the pieces of the paper in a hat and each player draws one randomly, and then every player has to

767
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,400
 pitch their two noun solution to the problem. And so Elon Musk has to basically pitch two nouns

768
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,400
 without knowing what the problem is. And you've got to try and work out who Elon Musk is

769
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,360
 because of iPod submarine. I mean, it's very similar to the game, the chameleon and like other

770
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:33,200
 folk games. But I think I would, I would play that game. I'll put a link to iPod submarine in the

771
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,400
 show notes. I think it was iPod submarine that I was thinking of, or someone's done a variation on

772
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,640
 iPod submarine where it's not maybe the world's problems but an invention for something you have

773
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,280
 to come up with. But yeah, I think it was very similar to that. Like one person is kind of hoping

774
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,520
 that no one realizes you're just saying random words put together. And yeah, it's that like,

775
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,000
 you know, you need at least one person to not get it to get the points kind of aspect.

776
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,200
 Yeah. Yeah, it was the, it was definitely the, the iPod submarine game I was thinking of.

777
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,880
 That was the Oct Thought Podcast. And it's goodbye from me.

778
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,440
 It's goodbye from me. And it's goodbye from me.

779
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:27,760
 [Music]

780
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,320
 Well, because guff means far, Alison.

781
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,120
 That's the episode title. Brilliant.

782
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,440
 I'm amazed you've not used that before, actually. I was, I thought you should go

783
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,640
 for it. Let's not pull on the thread if it doesn't matter what we think.

784
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:51,280
 I mean, I just, I don't, I mean, uh, it's tricky to, uh, really, you know,

785
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,800
 kind of keep it quiet. Um, yeah, maybe I'm just more apathetic about anything having meaning.
