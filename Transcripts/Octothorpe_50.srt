1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 I think we should just go down the bullets in order, John.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,360
 Yeah, no, but that's why I'm proposing a change.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,040
 I'd like to move that the discussion of the motion for the change is over the minutes.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,680
 No, no, no, no.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,520
 All right, 17.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,240
 Yes, OK, so let's move.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
 One.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,600
 So this, two, three.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,080
 Yay!

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,120
 That's not setting in the episode, but I enjoyed it a great deal.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,640
 That could have cold happened.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:40,880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,280
 Hello, everyone, and welcome to the 50th episode of OctoThought, the podcast for science fiction

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,320
 and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 3rd of February 2022.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,000
 I'm John Coxon.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,480
 I'm Alison Scott.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,720
 And I'm Liz Batty.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,240
 And we're 50.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,160
 That's fantastic, isn't it?

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,640
 It's kind of unbelievable.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,840
 What do you think, guys?

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
 I think it's very good that we're 50.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,000
 I think it's less good that I don't know what date it is.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,280
 So yes, we are 50.

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
 It has been a wild ride.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,440
 And as we do the last episode of OctoThought, I just want to tell all our listeners that

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,440
 we really appreciate you being here with us.

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,400
 We've, like, actually just been planning the next three, John.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,440
 John, what are you about to say that means there will be no more OctoThought

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
 stops ever?

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,320
 I mean, is it that you're not going to edit anymore because that would be an end, Dr.

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
 Thor?

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,220
 No, we'll just have Liz edit it.

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,520
 I'll just be like, I'll throw the files over to Liz and say, Liz, can you do a quick

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,880
 edit to then four months later?

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,200
 I'll go ask that edit coming along, Liz.

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,720
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm tired.

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,600
 Shot's very much fired.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,000
 I mean, I did not intend to start this argument, which will end the podcast.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,560
 Like, Joe, I appear to have done.

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,640
 We had some letters of comment.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,720
 And first up was Bill Burns sending us an email entitled, "What is a fanzine?"

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,760
 And he went into some details on how he and Nick Ferry originated that definition of fanzine.

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,440
 It was first published in the incomplete register for the 2018 van awards.

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,000
 Bill has kind of accepted the summary of the chain of emails, but I don't want to put

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,160
 it in the show, no, it's just in case because I kind of feel like it would go quite well

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,240
 in one of Nick's fanzines or maybe even a fanzine by Bill.

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,440
 So, but it's very good.

49
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
 Thank you for writing in, Bill.

50
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
 It was very interesting.

51
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,760
 Yeah, even if you disagree with people, it's nice to see kind of their reasoning and

52
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,840
 how they get to that position.

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,360
 Well, it's the fan nature, isn't it, to disagree in entertaining ways?

54
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,320
 We tried to hold that a lot to Thorpe, don't we, guys?

55
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,400
 We do.

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:01,120
 We also got an email from Chris Garcia and he says, "John has a tedious NPC hat.

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,680
 It would go very well with my me and my thousands of friends won a Hugo in 2019/ and yes, it

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,080
 would, Chris."

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,760
 If you need that decorating for you, I guarantee you that I will misuse the Hugo Awards logo

60
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,480
 and get a cease and desist and promise to do it again and do it almost exactly the same

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,560
 way but slightly differently and they're up tie up the NPC for years.

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
 Sorry, guys.

63
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,000
 Chris, if you do have that/please send us a photo.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,600
 And then he talked a little bit about news resolutions.

65
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,200
 He doesn't commit himself to resolutions just because his calendar is obsolete.

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,600
 Most years he just tries to do the same thing.

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,480
 Watch more wrestling, put out a few issues of various things and record a bunch of podcast.

68
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,400
 When you're as vague as he is, it's hard not to meet your goal.

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,200
 That is a good philosophy.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,160
 So Peter Sullibar said, "You're all fluent enough in management speak to know that New

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,240
 Year's resolutions that I'd like to achieve but don't get too fast if I don't have to

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:03,440
 be referred to these days as "stretch goals" and "I just wanted to say that I can't do

73
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,800
 that because I have stretch goals which involve me standing up every hour and stretching."

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,920
 Is this because your Apple Watch instructs you to do that?

75
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
 Pretty sure John also has stretch goals?

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
 Liz, do you have stretch goals?

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,960
 No, I find that I naturally get out of my chair and stretch every hour when I need a

78
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,520
 no cup of coffee.

79
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,600
 We have a rule in our house that if Spania is not allowed to bring me coffee because otherwise

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,960
 I would never get out of my chair and stretch.

81
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
 And that is, I think, a good rule.

82
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,920
 It is what I would call a life hack.

83
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
 Yeah, no, no.

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,760
 We have a rule in our house which is that Stephen is going to bring me a coffee halfway through

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,800
 this podcast otherwise I'm going to fall asleep in the second half of the podcast.

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,920
 I mean, you know, different strokes for different folks.

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,720
 Let's try it out and see if the listeners notice.

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,480
 Hahaha.

89
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,360
 I heard the clipping in my earphones so that is going to be sorry listeners.

90
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,200
 If that doesn't normalise down, I was loud laugh.

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,560
 The Dave Coxen writes in to ask us, well, he asks us two questions.

92
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,000
 Firstly, he asks whether he can follow us on Goodreads.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,120
 And so yes, anyone who would like to can follow us on Goodreads and I've put links

94
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,400
 in the show notes and Alison and I are also on Letterbox, Board Game Geek and Untapped

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,040
 if you'd like to see what we're watching, drinking and playing.

96
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,000
 And so yeah, feel free to follow us on there.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,960
 Dave also asks us probably more importantly what style of beer and maybe even sub-style

98
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,560
 of beer you'd go for as a threesome which will require us to agree on something which

99
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
 might be tricky.

100
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
 Um, milk stout.

101
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,400
 I am partial to a milk stout.

102
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
 Oh, I do like a good milk stout actually.

103
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
 There we go.

104
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
 Hey.

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
 [Music]

106
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,760
 Octa Thorpe Podcast Corner.

107
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,920
 Oh, I would just thought Podcast Corner which is a feature I just invented is basically I

108
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,240
 quite like Alison telling us about Hugo Girl last week, last fortnight on the podcast.

109
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,240
 And so I thought I would tell you about what I've been listening to over the past couple

110
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,880
 of weeks which is the Caribbean SF podcast, a podcast about all things science fiction,

111
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,600
 fantasy, horror and folklore coming from the Caribbean.

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,000
 It's just a really well done, really interesting podcast.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,200
 It's always entirely interviews with different authors and creators from the Caribbean.

114
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,000
 A couple of episodes I will recommend is I listened to the one with Karen Lord and they

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,680
 talk about, she wrote a story called The Plague Doctors before the current pandemic came out

116
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,360
 but which does have a lot of resonances with the current pandemic and so that was a really

117
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,000
 interesting thing to listen to.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,920
 There's also an interview with an author called Brandon O'Brien and it is about his poetry

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,360
 chat book, Can You Sign My Tentacle?

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,160
 Which is about hip hop and the Thulu mythos which are two things that I did not imagine

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,080
 would make for like a good topic for poetry but it's really good and he kind of gets into

122
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,240
 how like he's using this kind of the hip hop kind of as a vehicle to you know interrogate

123
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,080
 the Lovecraft mythos.

124
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,640
 It's interesting, it's well produced.

125
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,960
 It's about topics in science fiction that I am not completely aware of and so it's given

126
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,520
 me some good book recommendations as well so I recommend giving it a listen.

127
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,720
 Yeah, I was hoping to get a chance to listen to that before this weekend but I picked the

128
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,120
 Brandon O'Brien one, it's really interesting and I then went and bought his poetry chat

129
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,200
 book which is like two quid on Amazon.

130
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,280
 So eBooks have been great for poetry chat books because the poets weren't getting any

131
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,840
 money when Faber and Faber sold you their chat book for 12.99 but you were thinking

132
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,440
 that 12.99 was a bit too much for a chat book but £2 is fun.

133
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,480
 There we are, I will take, I thought I'd already deleted that but I might be, right there we

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,000
 are, I found it, good, right, Nino, ooh but they have an interview with Malcolm Alder

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,200
 and I like Malcolm Alder and I've never heard of Brandon O'Brien but I do like Cthulhu's

136
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
 so.

137
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,840
 Yeah I would recommend you listen to it.

138
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,120
 Tentacles, like tentacles, like a bit of tentacle.

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,840
 Oi and indeed Oi.

140
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,200
 Thank you Liz, I will listen to the episode with Brandon O'Brien because it mentions

141
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:24,880
 Cthulhu's and I like Cthulhu's.

142
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,720
 We have convention corner.

143
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,120
 Conventions have been postponed so redemption has been postponed by a year, it was going

144
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,440
 to be, it was going to be this month as you're listening to the podcast listeners but it

145
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,280
 has been postponed to February in 2023 and court flu pang loss has been postponed to

146
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,400
 October 2022.

147
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,960
 I am a little bit worried that the big COVID numbers we've seen in winter the last couple

148
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,280
 of years might also recur in time to ruin redemption next year but it is true that we

149
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,360
 only have two years of data and so it's very difficult to make a pattern.

150
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,960
 I mean just about draw a line but a line of best fit or a model is not yet possible and

151
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,880
 so maybe it will be fine and court flu pang loss is postponed to October which Alison

152
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
 thinks is sensible.

153
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,400
 Yeah, now I have the exact opposite argument which is that court flu as we remember is

154
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,960
 the only science fiction convention that managed not to miss the year due to the pandemic

155
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,600
 because it just managed to slip a court flu in immediately before the pandemic for people

156
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,840
 who weren't worried.

157
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,800
 They got to go to college station in Texas and then it slipped in another one last October

158
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 because it turns out you can have conventions in that period between kind of September and

159
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,120
 November and I went to three last year plus of course, this gone happened in December

160
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,040
 and I'm hoping that the same thing will happen this year so I say move to the autumn because

161
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,680
 I think it's got a better bet for working for you than moving a year.

162
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,800
 I've been looking at an answerable and answerable is full of stories of people delaying their

163
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,800
 convention either to 2023 or to later in 2022.

164
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,460
 I think the saddest story on the answerable list is Chillicon which was due to be 63,

165
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:21,120
 19th April 2020 was postponed first to August 2020 then to January 2021 then to March 2022

166
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
 and has now been postponed again.

167
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,160
 The last we've heard of PicoCon is that they're still planning to run in person in early March

168
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
 2022.

169
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,000
 ICSF which is the organization that holds PicoCon are aiming for an in person convention on

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,400
 the 5th of March.

171
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,440
 Their argument is that they might as well plan for in person because it's much easier

172
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,160
 to switch from in person to online at the last minute than the reverse which is true

173
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,880
 and also they do everything at the last minute anyway so you know.

174
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,800
 I worry slightly that if we say well October is probably going to be better than February

175
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,440
 which it probably is but I think we honestly don't know.

176
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
 The problem is that then everyone will try and postpone themselves into October or November

177
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,640
 and we'll end up with this kind of crunch around the autumn.

178
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,520
 I can see why conventions are like okay we're just going to postpone for a year because

179
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,640
 that means we can keep our regular weekend which is the time you know we know our regular

180
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,000
 attendees don't have a huge number of clashes when our staff have time to work on it in

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,920
 the preceding few months that kind of thing.

182
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,920
 So I think it is in some ways a lot you just say okay we're going to bump it by year then

183
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,560
 bump it by six months and I think bumping to the pre-Christmas week for WorldCon probably

184
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,920
 did have knock on effects other than the fact they end up unfortunately in right in the

185
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,200
 middle of another COVID wave but I bet there were people who traditionally go to WorldCon's

186
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,280
 who could not attend just because of timing.

187
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,160
 I think you're probably right there Liz.

188
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,400
 I mean especially with a small con as well where you may have like a limited pool of

189
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,240
 staff if someone say actually October is no good for me because that's the start of

190
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,840
 academic year or something like that then you could have a big gap in your staffing.

191
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,040
 You may well be thinking Bob Pickers how all this pertains to the EasterCon and I think

192
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,480
 we're going to pick that up next time we record and pontificate about the EasterCon a lot at

193
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,400
 that point and maybe future Eastercons because there's lots of stuff coming out that we're

194
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,000
 learning about what people are thinking about going to in-person conventions.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,960
 The fan awards are not moving they're going to be on March 20th and they're going to zoom

196
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:30,440
 so even though golf flu was moved that's going to be a zoom event and when we have the link

197
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,600
 we will I don't know if we will let you know I think probably it's one of these things

198
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,280
 where if you know you know and if you don't ask one of us.

199
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,840
 That's me because I won't know that's John or Alison.

200
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,000
 If you ask Liz Liz will text us and we will answer.

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,960
 Yeah it will work just in there really.

202
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
 Sounds good.

203
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,480
 I hope the zoom event will be the time that's appropriate for UK people as well as West Coast

204
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,560
 Americans because it's very easy for things that are timed for the West Coast to not suit

205
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,000
 UK people very well being as they're in the middle of the night.

206
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And vice versa.

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,320
 So I want to talk a bit about the terrible decision of the fan award administrators to

208
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,400
 scrap best website because I think the TAF free eBooks page which we will put we will

209
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,640
 link to is well worth everyone's time to go and have a look at.

210
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,800
 I have spent some of this week reading True Rat which is one of the books on there and

211
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,280
 there's all sorts of cool and interesting stuff if you have any interest about what fans have

212
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,240
 been writing about over the last hundred years or so.

213
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,920
 There's a lot of stuff on there and a lot of it is very good and very funny.

214
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,000
 We're all free donations to TAF encouraged but it should win best website except apparently

215
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,400
 the fan awards are scrap best websites so boo bring back best websites so I can vote

216
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:55,760
 for the TAF eBooks page.

217
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,000
 We're going to talk a little bit about self promotion today.

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,400
 This is something that has become very common in the Hugo award electorate people putting

219
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,800
 up eligibility posts and talking about kind of what they've done that's eligible and

220
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,000
 kind of not quite plugging their work but making people aware of their work depending

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 on.

222
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,240
 I think there are probably people who think people are plugging but there's a spectrum

223
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,840
 of opinion as we'll get into and one of the things that that does is potentially shake

224
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,080
 up the odd category where the same things tend to win quite a bit and that kind of gets

225
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,520
 to the difference between awarding the objectively best thing in a field versus the thing that

226
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,800
 has caught the imagination at the moment in time.

227
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,360
 So Alison do you want to start on self promotion and then we can kind of spin off your robust

228
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
 opinions?

229
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,960
 Well I'm Alison Scott and here's a list of everything I've done this year that's eligible

230
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
 for the Hugo awards.

231
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,800
 Oh I think I'm eligible in seven categories.

232
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
 Seven?

233
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 Good Lord.

234
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,280
 No obviously not.

235
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,840
 I'm eligible for best novel.

236
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
 Are you?

237
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,880
 I contain at least a hundred thousand words and I am fictional.

238
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,560
 I have written more than 40,000.

239
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,840
 Are you fictional?

240
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,360
 That would explain a lot.

241
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:17,360
 So I wanted to start here by kind of expressing the traditional British view on self promotion

242
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,040
 and the reason I'm doing it as the traditional British view is that I've kind of moved a

243
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
 little way from this.

244
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,960
 So this is where I would have been about ten years again.

245
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,400
 Oh what?

246
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,720
 You mean there's an award that I might know I don't have anything to say about that.

247
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,480
 No it would be it would be mad because obviously there are all these many better things than

248
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,040
 me that have been nominated in this space or that are eligible and you should go and

249
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,960
 vote for them.

250
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,520
 And what you'll hope to have well it's very kind of you but really I don't think you should

251
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,480
 and I certainly wouldn't be voted for myself and oh oh we've won.

252
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,600
 That's very, oh that's so very kind.

253
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,680
 It never occurred to me that we might have won this.

254
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,440
 So you know you don't self promote, you don't omit even if pressed that you think what you

255
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,800
 do is good and is worthy of an award and if people nevertheless say it's worthy of award

256
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,720
 you kind of deny it wholeheartedly and you certainly don't vote for yourself and you

257
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,600
 don't encourage anyone else to vote for you and you dampen down any tendencies that you

258
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,200
 see amongst your intimates that they might be running a campaign for you.

259
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,880
 That feels like a very traditional British attitude.

260
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,840
 That's where I was 10 years ago.

261
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,080
 That's probably not one I have come across.

262
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,360
 Like I think that is more like I think the attitude I have come across is slightly more

263
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,440
 towards well I'm not going to go out and tell everyone to vote for it but if you ask

264
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,760
 me I'll say yeah I think I did a good thing and if you want to vote for it that's good.

265
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
 Kind of attitude.

266
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,040
 Oh no.

267
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,400
 When when pressed.

268
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:58,360
 When pressed I might admit actually I think this thing I did is alright probably and if

269
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,760
 you liked it that's very nice you know that kind of.

270
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,560
 But that's kind of where I am now.

271
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,760
 So I wanted to go a bit further over to that because definitely how I was brought up is

272
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,000
 very much in line with that is and I think the thing I wanted to say about it is that

273
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 it's rooted in a world in which everyone knows who the good chaps are and what they've done.

274
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,240
 So it's a very it's a it's a model that comes from privilege because it assumes that you

275
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,560
 can survey the field and have a good sense of all the stuff that is good out there which

276
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,040
 for the hugos and even to be honest for the fan awards is manifestly not true.

277
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,880
 So we need a new model.

278
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,800
 This ties into something I've thought for a while which is that I think that the distaste

279
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:50,000
 for self-promotion comes with it a implicit opinion that things that have tended to win

280
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,560
 awards are things which are deserving of winning awards in that in the last kind of maybe sort

281
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,520
 of sort of I would argue and I don't know maybe my my view of the history here is is

282
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,440
 is deficient and I'm sure you do both chip in if that is true.

283
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,480
 But I think I think self-promotion is getting more common especially in the hugos but in

284
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,840
 general in the field and that has been happening maybe over the last 15 or 20 years particularly

285
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,960
 would that do you think that's a fair statement or do you think I'm off base there.

286
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,920
 I got into a row with John Scalsy about this.

287
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,920
 So old man's war when was that guys.

288
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,720
 2004 I think.

289
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,360
 Yeah so that's nearly 20 years ago and I think that was the point at which I was kind

290
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,800
 of like I got into row with him because I was basically channeling Britain and he was

291
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,720
 like no no it's completely fine to say what's good and he was right and I was wrong and

292
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,440
 so that's 20 years really 17 years.

293
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,280
 2005 when the Hugo in 2006 I was a year out so so about 15 or 20 years excellent and so

294
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,480
 I think I think I can see why people have this to stay for self-promotion because what

295
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,040
 it does is it means that the people with the loudest voices have the most power in controlling

296
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,280
 the conversation and that is not always a good thing.

297
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,360
 Having said that prior to self-promotion I think what was mostly affecting the conversation

298
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,000
 and kind of where the power was vested was to a large extent gender and ethnicity in

299
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,160
 that a lot of the Hugo winners before kind of 2000 are predominantly white males and

300
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,640
 people who are privileged enough to have been able to be on the ballot before because

301
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,280
 it means that if you don't have the ability to self-promote the only way of coming to

302
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,480
 the attention of the electorate is to win the Hugo and what that means is that people

303
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,720
 who have already won the Hugo's are much more likely to win more Hugo's than people

304
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,960
 who haven't and so I think self-promotion is a good way of trying to dismantle that

305
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,520
 power structure of kind of what has gone before and bring in a new power structure.

306
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,200
 Now that power structure also has privilege in it it just has different privileges in

307
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,560
 it and I'm not saying it's necessarily perfect but I do think that it does a better job

308
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,320
 of surfacing diverse voices than the old paradigm did and I think it is not a coincidence that

309
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,800
 in the last certainly in the last five years but I think starting about 15 years ago you

310
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,840
 did start to see more and more diverse works when Hugo's and that's part of why we had

311
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,560
 the reaction in 2015 of the Sadpuppy and that whole frick heart was because that was

312
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,560
 beginning to really gain steam and begin to anger the people who had had that power before.

313
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,560
 I do think in general I am a fan of the way that self-promotion has opened the field up

314
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,560
 a bit now I am very British listeners so I don't self-promote.

315
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,440
 I think we might be talking about two separate things here which is I see self-promotion

316
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,280
 as promoting your own works is one thing but self-promotion as promoting your own works

317
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,760
 specifically for awards is a separate thing. Every author now has to promote their own

318
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,400
 works it is kind of the expected thing I think the new authors will have Twitter feed

319
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,600
 they will guest on podcasts and so on so I don't think I'm so much talking about that

320
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,280
 as a specific thing of saying this is what I wrote this year and it is eligible for a

321
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:10,680
 Hugo in best level. I post Opto-Talk to Ephranzines Facebook Twitter file 770 two discords and I

322
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,840
 have a reminder every two weeks to do that and I think that is probably self-promotion

323
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,680
 in the sense that I think I want people to know that I'm doing a podcast and if they would like

324
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,000
 to listen to it they can. So when I say I don't self-promote I very much mean in the sense of

325
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 I don't say I'm eligible for a Hugo award because that's not my jam but I do tell people I do a

326
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,720
 podcast so I think the one you said about authors I'm completely like yeah authors should talk about

327
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,080
 their books grand the thing I think I was talking about more is the awards side.

328
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:46,920
 I'm going to follow up with that I mean it's not we're not really the controversial thing isn't about

329
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:55,320
 saying is it about marketing right it's not about saying oh I have a podcast and I'm going to make

330
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,760
 try and make sure that wherever I am on the internet I mentioned the fact that I have a podcast

331
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,040
 that people might like if I think I'm in the sort of community that might enjoy what we do here I'm

332
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,840
 going to try and tell them about the podcast I don't think that's that's not self-promote it's

333
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,720
 not in the same way of you know it's not like the author who who who stacks their books up in front

334
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,440
 of their space in the panel and whenever I asked a question says well in my book X I did Y I don't

335
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,480
 you know you could go too far even in the marketing line but in terms of eligibility for awards I

336
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,640
 think that we're primarily saying is it sensible when it comes to award time to promote a desert.

337
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,400
 Yeah now I just wanted to clarify what we were talking about and then my question is I think

338
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:46,600
 you can say that like the timing of people becoming more open about their eligibility and more open

339
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,480
 to kind of promoting their own eligibility for awards probably does coincide with award sets of

340
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,800
 nominees and finalists becoming more diverse but I'm not sure how much of that is actually

341
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:05,160
 kind of causative as opposed to just a correlation but I basically mellowed a lot and I'm like okay

342
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,400
 if you want to promote your Hugo eligibility that's fine but it almost never prompts me to actually

343
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,920
 vote for something because I'm going to vote to nominate for things that I have read and

344
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,400
 light it's more effective if I get told about something earlier on so I can go and seek it out

345
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,480
 and read it if it sounds interesting to me if you say I did this thing and it should go eligible

346
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,760
 you know probably that's not going to make much of an influence on what I actually know and

347
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,840
 I invoke for there are ways to do this that are more objectionable and there are ways that are

348
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,560
 less objectionable or the less objectionable ones may in fact be more effective depending on

349
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:44,120
 what it is that you are telling people about. In general the stuff I nominate for the Hugos is

350
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:50,200
 not stuff that I saw someone on Twitter say oh I am eligible because I did this thing because usually

351
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,800
 I am already aware that they did the thing. In some cases it is useful for instance if you are a

352
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,720
 short story writer it is actually quite useful to do an eligibility post where you're like these

353
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,480
 ones are the novelettes because that is helpful I do appreciate that and even if you're not a big

354
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,160
 fan of self-promotion that's just numbers folks numbers are grand. I like the general trend of people

355
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:17,240
 being more open to talking about what they have done regularly and often on their you know Twitter

356
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,280
 feed to blogs or whatever on the grounds and if I'm following you it's probably because I'm

357
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,000
 interested in your work and so I think that is good to try and raise my awareness and remind me

358
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,280
 oh yeah you did you know your book came out this week and maybe I like to go and pick it up or

359
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,040
 your book is out and pay back this week and maybe I'd like to go and check it out but the specific

360
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,080
 eligibility posts I just sort of you know usually drift over and don't pay much attention to.

361
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,320
 It's all very well saying here's what's eligible but you do have to be pushing it to

362
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:48,200
 an open door to some extent if you say oh actually you know that night in the pub where I ranted for

363
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,760
 93 minutes without drawing breath that's eligible for best dramatic presentation that is I feel like

364
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,080
 that's not necessarily the best use of eligibility post. Not nominating your pub

365
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:05,400
 rant, Alison. I'm hurt now. People have nominated worse. Got them. The other thing that's really useful

366
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,720
 is when you've got someone who writes a series and they're like actually not not eligible this

367
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,600
 year because I've not written enough new words since the last time I got nominated and that is

368
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,720
 also quite useful and again like that that gets back to Alison's point about pushing it an open

369
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,720
 door like I'm not going to care whether or not your series is eligible this year unless I was

370
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,440
 already thinking of nominating it but what I might do is realize you are writing a series

371
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,640
 and end up reading it. But also that thing where you're like oh my series not eligible this year

372
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,760
 but it yeah because I haven't written less words that's a bit like going oh no this chap was ahead

373
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,520
 of me at the bar. Yeah no it is. You're doing it to the hopes that you'll get surfed at. Yes

374
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,920
 getting back to what I said right at the beginning about the things that win being the most effective

375
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,040
 form of promotion. Most of my maybe not most of my favorite authors but certainly like a chunk of

376
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,480
 the people I read in the field I read because I saw the one a Hugo ballot and now I follow their work.

377
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,280
 So for instance I got into NK Jemisin's fiction because the 100,000 kingdoms was in the Hugo

378
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:14,280
 voter packet in 2011 maybe and like I'm sure that that's not true for everyone but it's definitely

379
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:20,600
 true for me and Ditto, Nettie or Corifor like I discovered their work through the Hugo

380
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:27,480
 voter packet Martha Wells you know a lot of people and so and so even with this uptick in self-promotion

381
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,400
 that the most effective way of getting your name out there is still to be on the ballot.

382
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:38,040
 So two things both from last episodes the first is that this is why the long list is such a good

383
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,080
 place to find interesting things because the things that don't quite get on the ballot are often

384
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,720
 amazing and actually getting to learn about those creators and what they're doing is often more

385
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,000
 exciting than seeing the same names that are actually on the ballot for the sixth time so there's that

386
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,560
 and the other thing is that we talked a little bit last time about the practice of fan winners

387
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,840
 recusing themselves for a year and I think that's kind of very very good for helping break that

388
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,360
 sense of I will vote for the things that I am that I am used to voting for. That sense of we can

389
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,200
 break up the category a bit just by just by spiking ourselves for a year to get people to think about

390
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,640
 the broader category is quite good in this regard. Yeah and this is of course a form of self-promotion

391
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,040
 because the people they're now magnanimous in addition to all their other virtues. Indeed one

392
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,080
 and the other thing is that like so I got two comments on that which is firstly I think my

393
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,400
 point about self-promotion being good because it helps to break up the established pool of people

394
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,240
 who make it onto the ballot. I think the people who match that by also recusing themselves when

395
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,360
 they have won or when they have run one like several I think those go hand in hand I think

396
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,880
 if you are self-promoting and then you just win the Hugo year after year after year and never say

397
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,440
 actually let's let someone else have a go that is a sign that you are self-promoting for the wrong

398
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,920
 reasons because I think self-promotion is great because it makes everyone more aware of what's there

399
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,720
 but I don't think it should be a tool for like dominating the field if that makes sense and so

400
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,040
 especially and I'm really sorry to uncanny I subscribe to uncanny I like them very much

401
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,800
 but especially uncanny I'm like you see the eligibility process and it's like but you guys

402
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,880
 you clearly just want more rockets on your mantle piece and I find that understandable on a personal

403
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,760
 level but I don't think it's good for the field and so I really do wish that that they would recuse

404
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,040
 themselves uh I'm gonna keep banging this drum apparently. Part of the other thing about self-promotion

405
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:41,560
 is and maybe this is unfair because um fire do great work but it's also you get into self-promotion

406
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:48,120
 where fire ran a convention and then after that convention won best pro-scene and obviously the

407
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,600
 convention was also nominated for best-related work and didn't win and so there's an element here

408
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,960
 where you're beginning to see people do things in different arenas and that kind of feed back into

409
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,600
 into promoting their works in kind of their more established categories I think and that's quite

410
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,880
 interesting um yeah so I would say it would be it would be strange for uncanny to recuse

411
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,360
 themselves at this point I think because they didn't win I think it makes more sense to recuse

412
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,000
 yourself just after you won I think it's weird to recuse yourself after you he didn't win. True that.

413
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,120
 That's fair. I mean I will I and I take I take your point on like fire having a convention but I

414
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,360
 mean that's a valid way to to show people your magazine is out there and oh yeah I might even

415
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,840
 say that we ran some conventions and possibly picked up more listeners for our podcast because

416
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:41,000
 we gave ourselves a live recording in the middle of it so look right we did that because we didn't

417
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,960
 have any better ideas for program on a Sunday morning list and you know it um also I don't

418
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,680
 think we did put live recordings in either of our conventions did we because we were busy running

419
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:57,240
 the conventions I thought we did a live opt-off for punctuation too we did do a live opt-off

420
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,640
 for punctuation too. So dear. We did do it on Sunday morning you you suffer it so effectively you have

421
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:14,120
 for forgotten yourself promoted yourself. Self-promoting bastards. I was also going to say that the

422
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,440
 Hugo Award eligibility spreadsheet as mentioned on this podcast before is also excellent for those

423
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,720
 questions of how many words are there in this story or is this particular magazine actually eligible

424
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,280
 under the you know arcane rules for determining what percentage of your income makes you a semi-prosine

425
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,080
 and so on and also for best series which I find to have very confusing eligibility rules.

426
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,520
 And here's a little plug for lady business because Renee does a ton of work making all that happen.

427
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,320
 Indeed. So I'm quite happy to see that out there because I know if someone else has gone and like

428
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,440
 calculated how many words were in these two new novels and is this thing eligible and best series

429
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,280
 and they share it with everyone else and then I don't have to go and try and do word counts on

430
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,520
 things. This may be a sign that we should reform some of the Hugo rules. Oh no wait that's a separate

431
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,120
 podcast isn't it? I think I will just say I didn't mean to imply that I thought fire was like

432
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:11,000
 I think if your form of self-promotion is running a convention that brings a community together and

433
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,040
 highlights a bunch of great work and discussions of the genre like that that is a fantastic way

434
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,280
 to self-promote like 10 out of 10. I agree that uncanny shouldn't have recused themselves given

435
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,160
 that they didn't win but also I don't think fire should have recused themselves after winning either

436
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,160
 just because I think that would just mean it went immediately back to how it was for the last five

437
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,880
 years and so I think there is an interesting dynamic there which is I like the winners in

438
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,480
 best fanzine recusing themselves because best fanzine has been a vibrant category that has

439
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,640
 been swapping around a lot but I'm glad fire didn't recuse themselves because I think it will be good

440
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,360
 if fire acts to break that category up a little bit and so like my thoughts they're actually

441
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,760
 quite complicated but I completely agree that recusing yourself when you don't win that that

442
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,640
 would be a weird flex well we didn't win so we're not playing anymore would be very much how it

443
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,320
 came across and that would be bad we have taken our ball away exactly yeah and that and throw the

444
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:07,080
 game across the table yeah I understand why they didn't do that I can see you can get into a weird

445
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,600
 loop though you might get into a weird loop where something wins and recuse itself you know thing a

446
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,000
 wins recuse themselves for a year thing be wins because themselves for a year thing a wins again

447
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,120
 you know I believe this is how boxing championships work oh is that a left field there's a lot of them

448
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,280
 because essentially they they carve it up a little bit so that every so they have six different

449
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:33,800
 world champions it's okay there's also a thing going on where people who maybe don't have the

450
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:40,040
 chops self-promote very aggressively and even having said that I think self-promotion is quite

451
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:45,400
 good and useful and eligibility person quite good and useful it's possible to overdo that

452
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,680
 quite a lot sometimes and people should watch out for it yeah one thing I actually like is when I

453
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,280
 see someone I know on my Twitter feed retweet someone else's eligibility post because presumably

454
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,840
 they mean I think this is a thing a wider audience should see and so that kind of gives it a layer

455
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,720
 of extra not only does the person who wrote this say yes eligible I'd love it if you would vote for

456
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,440
 it but someone else also thinks it's great and you should you should look into it so that's pretty

457
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:22,920
 nice that may be implicit so of course one form of self-promotion that isn't self-promotion at all

458
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:28,920
 is the fanfans where what you do is you run for a fan fund but you get a slate of nominators

459
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,720
 before you run for your fan fund in fact in many cases as in this one your nominators may have

460
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,200
 pressed you to run and then your nominators go around saying that you are an excellent person

461
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,560
 who should win the fan fund and in this case I want to say a little bit about Anders Hompstrom

462
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,880
 who is running for TAF this year there are four candidates for TAF for they're all great

463
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,960
 but I am one of Anders nominators and I think you should all vote for him and I kind of struggled

464
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,720
 with this a bit because I kind of spent a little while going well why should everyone vote for Anders

465
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,400
 it's because he's a great bloke isn't it and that's not you can see that might not be enough to sway

466
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:15,400
 your your voting but in fact he is an extremely interesting and gregarious chap who just makes

467
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:22,920
 friends very easily all over the world wherever he goes and that is a reason why as a representative

468
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,040
 for fandom he obviously does a ton of actual fanak in Sweden none of which I've personally

469
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:34,600
 experienced because I've never been to Sweden but wherever he goes he makes friends with everybody

470
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,120
 and gets to know lots and lots of different people and he would be a marvelous ambassador for

471
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,560
 European fandom in that sense and that's really what fandom what TAF is all about so you know if

472
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,360
 you're in North America please vote for him and if you're in the UK or Europe please vote for him

473
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,760
 and yet everyone please vote for Anders for TAF that's not self-promotion that's Anders's promotion

474
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:03,240
 Anders will be a very good TAF winner should he win but I am casting my first preference vote

475
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:11,320
 for fear kalston who will introduce the entire of north america to dill chips this is not wrong

476
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,640
 so north americans which is more important to you dill chips or beer why not both i mean you know

477
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,360
 i don't know what happens in the taffrels if there is a straight tie i assume you flip a coin but i

478
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,160
 don't know i could look i could look it up but someone should write a lock instead so i'm not

479
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,400
 going to octa thought listeners we wonder what happens if there is a straight tie no actually

480
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,640
 sorry no there's a better way of doing this if there's a straight tie in the taffcom test what

481
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:45,640
 happens is each of the two people who have tied chooses a five person football team and a football

482
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:52,120
 match is played in the gardens of the hilton metropole at bermingham and that is how it's decided that

483
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:58,360
 is fact and you would have to write in to dissuade me that it wasn't on the subject of promoting

484
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:04,760
 selves who are not us professor esta mccallum stewart is having her in nor'grill professorial

485
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,080
 lecture at the university of staphaiture and that lecture is on dungeons and dragons at 50 and it is

486
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,680
 being streamed online and you can get tickets for free it is the same day that i'm going to go see

487
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,960
 the book of mormon allegedly in a theater although i don't know whether that will be postponed again

488
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,720
 but i will be there with bells on i'm very excited i am going to be listening to esta's

489
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,480
 thing you'll probably be able to tune in afterwards to her talk so if you can imagine me when i was 10

490
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,840
 which is quite a long time ago and i just learned of the existence of a new game called

491
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,760
 dungeons and dragons and it was in a magazine so i didn't actually get to play it with anyone

492
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,680
 i was just very excited about it but if you imagine that somebody had handed me a science fiction book

493
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:59,400
 which opened up with oh i i i was a student and i was late for my lecture i logged into the

494
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:06,200
 computer and there on the video screen in front of me appeared the pink head frame of my

495
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:13,800
 video game professor of video games dr esta mccallum stewart she said right i hope you've all

496
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,240
 been studying hard because this is the lecture on dungeons and dragons

497
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:24,760
 that would have provided every bit of future sense of wonder i could ever have possibly imagined

498
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,040
 whatever anyone's like we don't live in a good enough future i i just want to just want to point

499
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:36,120
 them to the fact that we have a professor in professorial in all your lecture online on dungeons and

500
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:42,680
 dragons at 50 and i am very excited by a female professor of gaming and that is just like unbelievably

501
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:50,280
 wonderful so um yeah in her spare time she she is also the vid chair of class good 2024 hi guys

502
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,480
 and there is a link in the show notes it's at 6 p.m on the 28th of february 2022 so it will be late

503
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,640
 for liz gosh wow oh boy oh boy oh boy did i not say that bit i mean you can watch my in order

504
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,600
 or doctoral lecture online but it is not about dungeons and dragons so it is there actually

505
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,120
 when you do your in order or professorial lecture online i will come and watch it but i might play

506
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:20,600
 halfstone at the same time that is fair we are on the bsfa long list and so that means at least

507
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:27,240
 one person has nominated us for the best non-fiction thing at the bsfa awards so thank you very much

508
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:35,240
 to whoever that person or persons were and yeah bsfa members are now able to vote for the things

509
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,840
 that they want to be on the shortlist and then the shortlist will be voted on at easter con and

510
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:47,160
 easter con and bsfa members can vote on those awards there and they are presented at easter con

511
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,360
 so um yes if you're a bsfa member you should go and vote uh you shouldn't necessarily vote for

512
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,520
 us but you should definitely vote for things thank you to our fam thank you to whoever thought

513
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:05,400
 that oct thought was non-fiction when as we've established i'm a novel you're novel

514
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,760
 and not really i'm another white bloke doing a podcast how novel can i be i'd give myself a two out of ten

515
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:25,000
 right so one of the things that happened in the real news this week is um the vibes boots index

516
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,240
 and i wanted to talk a little bit about it because it is relevant to i guess science fiction being

517
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:41,000
 relevant which is that jackman roe who is a poverty campaigner here observed that poor people are

518
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,680
 paying more for stuff than everybody else and the poorer you are the more of your money you pay for

519
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,760
 stuff that you have to have necessities and the more the faster the cost of those necessities is

520
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:59,240
 currently rising in the uk and um spoiler it's about to get a great deal worse over the next few

521
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:07,160
 months um and that this was affecting poor people much more than rich people and that the current

522
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:13,640
 price index is used in the united kingdom do not properly reflect that and it our office of national

523
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:22,520
 statistics said yeah they're right that's the case and jack said i am going to start a new index that

524
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:28,760
 will more accurately reflect what real people are paying for food so that we know how much these

525
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,480
 prices are rising in a time when they're about to rise a lot and i want to call it the vibes boots

526
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,080
 index after terry pratchett's observation that if you're poor you can't afford to buy boots that will

527
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,000
 last any amount of time whereas if you're rich you can buy but boots that will last much longer

528
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,640
 than this applies to many things not just boots and the pratchett estate said yep we're very happy

529
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,960
 with that off you go so that's what it's going to be called and well done sir terry for accurately

530
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,280
 identifying this in a way that really resonates with a lot of people it's not a new observation

531
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,360
 but i think he made it a lot clearer and well done jackman roe for highlighting this problem

532
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:13,720
 in uk society and boo to the government can i say that boo to inequality and or i think i'm very

533
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,680
 much on the um side of the vibes boots index that benefits rather than doesn't and so i think it is

534
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,560
 good that people are drawing attention to this i'm glad that people are talking about the cost of

535
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,120
 living as it pertains to the people for whom it really matters which are the people who don't

536
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,680
 have a little money and can't really afford stuff yep

537
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:44,920
 uh and then shall we do picks remember that self-promotion thing at the beginning of this year i said

538
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,200
 on facebook tell me about a good book that was published in 2021 and lots of people gave me

539
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,320
 suggestions which i am now trying to get hold of copies of without buying because i am a cheap

540
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:02,280
 skate and one of the ones that was suggested was that graham slight said oh there's a kind of very

541
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,560
 big and grand sf novel called the actual star by monica bern and it's great and this is you

542
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:15,080
 will like it and um i went i said oh i looked at her but i thought oh that sounds like exactly my

543
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,240
 sort of thing and i looked at my library and it said you will get it in approximately 24 weeks which

544
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:26,040
 is after the hugo nominations close and then um there was a tweet which we will link to with the

545
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:31,960
 show notes from monica saying if you're a hugo voter and you would like to read my book please get

546
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,960
 in touch so she sent me a copy so i've now read it and it's fantastic it is a magnificent book really

547
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,760
 really enjoyed it i'll say a tiny bit about it which is it is three linked stories one of which

548
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,440
 is a historical novel um with totally imaginary characters rather than a historical novel about

549
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:57,800
 real characters set a thousand years ago in um a main civilization um which is now in belise

550
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:06,760
 and um a strand that is set is a contemporary novel about somebody travels to the same location

551
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:14,360
 and a set that is set and a novel that is set a thousand years in the future um in a new utopia

552
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:21,240
 society where nobody stays or very few people stay anywhere very much but people travel around a

553
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,400
 lot and come together temporarily and it's a very interesting society so you've kind of got she

554
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,960
 intended to do it as a three novel series but was persuaded i think entirely correctly to

555
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,680
 intertwine all of these novels and there are many um points of commonality between the three stories

556
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,200
 and it's all comes together in an ending which i think she more or less lands um obviously the

557
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,160
 problem with these are hugely ambitious novels is quite hard to land the ending i've got a couple

558
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,560
 of it's out of trigger warning for cutting for self-harm at the front of the book so there is that

559
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:06,440
 because it's actual ritual cutting as part of the um societies and there is there is not but might

560
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:12,760
 also be trigger warnings for a whole host of other um fairly extraordinary scenes there's quite a

561
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,600
 lot of a lot of the thing this novel is doing is making you think feel different things and and

562
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:25,320
 it does that quite well with some quite shocking scenes um it is quite hard to read one of the

563
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:31,160
 things that people come up with is they say oh this is more like literary fiction than most sf and

564
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,600
 it definitely is so it's kind of got the those literary fiction books which people say oh these

565
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,280
 are really really good but the actual science fiction bits of it are a bit rubbish it doesn't

566
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:46,440
 have that the actual science fiction bit of a solid um really enjoyed it um it'll be on my

567
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:53,080
 balance unless i read five better 2021 novels so well done Monica for self-promoting it exactly

568
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:59,080
 the right time your description your description is interesting because it it sounds quite a lot

569
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,480
 like cloud atlas by david mitchell which i hugely enjoyed so i'm looking forward to reading the

570
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:11,720
 actual star but that is also an sf no work and is also literary so it kind of has a lot of those

571
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:20,200
 same hallmarks so like i i really loved cloud atlas and so i am i am excited to read the actual star

572
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:28,120
 and i also have my copy from uh monica and as i say we'll put a link in the show notes um i would say

573
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,680
 that the author it totally reminded me of was because it as well as having the sense of ritual

574
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:42,280
 place it also has some ritual objects and it reminded me of alan garners work in terms of

575
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,920
 evoking that sense of place through history which is something that i'm very interested in um on the

576
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:58,760
 subject of books that stick the landing my pick for this episode is leviathan falls by james sa

577
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:07,000
 kori this is the ninth book in the expanse series and i really really liked it i thought it did a

578
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,480
 fantastic job of wrapping all of the different plot strands up there is one more book in the series

579
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,800
 to come but that's like a compilation of all of the short fiction that they've written in the

580
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,600
 universe uh so i will be picking that up at some point the one thing i found really interesting

581
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:31,160
 is how the end of the nine book arc is very different to the end of the tv series which ends

582
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,880
 at the end of book six and it makes sense because the tv series ends very much in the same way as

583
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:42,600
 book six but book nine kind of does a lot to kind of manipulate that ending and kind of i don't know

584
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,560
 i don't know whether it subverts it necessarily but like i really found it interesting comparing

585
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,600
 and contrasting the two given that i kind of experienced the two endings very close together

586
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,640
 but yeah i really enjoyed it well worth well worth reading the nine books and um and yeah

587
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,080
 i am glad that they managed to kind of get to the end and and bring it to a close you know it's not

588
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:08,600
 often that you read a nine book uh series and it actually ends without like the author's dying and

589
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:14,440
 need to employ brandon sanderson so uh ten out ten for that it's that three episodes in a row

590
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:20,120
 that we've had the expanse as one of the picks can we carry on for managing to bring it up every

591
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,720
 couple of weeks for the rest of the year because that will be quite funny well i've got another

592
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:30,440
 seven books to read and you've got another like 150 episodes so maybe more like 50 i think

593
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:37,640
 let's you know i'm a sixth way through it so so baby how's the expanse had the best series you go

594
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:44,200
 yeah the expanse won best series two years ago i think which i think was richly deserved and

595
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,600
 exactly the sort of thing that that award uh should be being awarded to does that mean it's out of the

596
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:56,920
 running forever yeah you can't it things can only win best series once so if it lo if it had lost

597
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,640
 it would come back into play but because it won it's not in play because otherwise miles more cozy

598
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,800
 can would just win best series for the rest of time yeah she's not right they went that great speed

599
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,160
 anymore though i mean she's only written like but she did win both of the first two best series

600
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:17,880
 hugos so like i do think even at the reduced pace uh it might still happen she could have just

601
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,880
 alternated vorkos again and chalion yeah so i quite like that they built in the recusements

602
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:29,880
 basically in the in the category definition yeah that makes sense but yeah i don't i don't i mean

603
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,360
 it's not i wouldn't be eligible again yet it's not reached that point so would be a good few years

604
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:42,360
 uh so my pick is a novella by Adrian Tchaikovsky called elder race which basically has a really

605
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:49,080
 neat central gimmick premise anyway what's going on is that you get the first chapter of this novella

606
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,920
 which is the fourth daughter of the queen and the demon is terrorizing the land and she must go and

607
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,360
 see the sorcerer who lives that in the tower on the hill to get him to help save her peoples and

608
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,360
 then the next chapter we get is from the perspective of the sorcerer who lives on the hill there is in

609
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:11,960
 fact an anthropologist from a technologically advanced civilization who is here to research

610
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,360
 these people so they're all from earth but you know it's one of these like it's a colony and it

611
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:21,320
 has been lost and over the years and it's become you know technologically less advanced and he has

612
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:29,320
 come to uh study them and it basically goes through this fancy princess and the anthropologist

613
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:36,600
 slash sorcerer going off to find the demon and essentially the anthropologist's decision of like

614
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,000
 how much can i remain objective here how much should i try and stick to my mission of

615
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,680
 not interfering and just observing or how much have i already become you know entangled with this

616
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:53,080
 civilization and the right thing to do now is to is to aid them uh in this and that's basically

617
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,920
 that the plot of the novella so the chapters alternate for a while until they become you know

618
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,000
 they stop alternating because we've kind of got to point where they're more entwined and he's

619
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,360
 decided you know he's going to take more of a role and he is actually going to go on this quest and

620
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,440
 try and you know tell them what's going on and it follows things like you know he's tried to tell

621
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,160
 them what the situation is that because nothing he says about like science and technology translates

622
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,960
 they still think he's a wizard with magic powers it's also got this interesting thing where our you

623
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,040
 know anthropologist protagonist is extremely depressed and has a lot of problems with depression

624
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:28,120
 especially as he's had no contact from his homeworld for a long time and and is alone but he has a

625
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:34,440
 technological device which allows him to put off feeling these emotions for a time and then at some

626
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,240
 point he has to choose when to turn this off and like feel all this crushing depression but

627
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,800
 allows it could have turned them off so he can function and it's an interesting portrayal of you

628
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:50,840
 know his uh you know mental illness and how this is also perceived by this civilization which really

629
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,840
 can't conceive an idea that he has something in his head where he can kind of delay feeling these

630
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:00,120
 emotions and his you know feelings around having this and his feelings around his mental illness

631
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:05,640
 and it adds the kind of extra dimension that i like so it's pretty good it's 2021 so i guess it is

632
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,600
 eligible for a cue girl although the fact that Adrian Tragowski wrote three novellas last year might

633
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:20,360
 might mean he sort of split his vote yeah i will say i will say so Adrian Tragowski is like amazing

634
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:25,000
 i've liked everything i've read of his uh i wouldn't say i've read loads but like i've liked everything

635
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:32,840
 i have he's won the clock award twice one once they children have time but he doesn't seem to get

636
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,000
 much of a look in at the he goes and i don't really know why because he is amazing and he should

637
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,320
 more people should vote for him and i guess maybe he's just appealing too much to the British market

638
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,720
 and not enough overseas i don't know but would highly recommend people go and look his stuff up

639
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:52,280
 because he is great well if we were to read all three of the 2021 Tragowski novellas we could have

640
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:58,120
 an argument about which one people should put on their Hugo nomination but i feel like Tragowski is

641
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:05,320
 under under recognized at this point he he has not been sufficiently award-shaped i think that is

642
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,600
 true i i think i would agree with that i think i like this because you know i've read you know i read

643
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,160
 some of his Empire and Black and Gold series i've read you know children of time and children of

644
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,960
 earth and this feels like again it's kind of another departure from those he's not writing the same

645
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,520
 work over and over again he's really writing kind of completely different things at novella

646
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:31,000
 length and that giant novel length so i find uh really interesting maybe it's not the best way to

647
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,520
 grow your readership if you kind of write something different every every time you write a work

648
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,480
 uh but i i enjoyed this one i think you mean children of ruin not children of earth but yes

649
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:49,640
 oh children of earth is torture one isn't it so shards of earth which is Tragowski's 2021 novel

650
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:56,280
 is on my hold list from the library with a 21 24 week wait so Adrien if you're listening to this

651
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:03,000
 and you'd like me to read your novel before nomination times don't send me it get the London

652
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,840
 libraries consortium to buy a load more ebooks of it and then lots of people can read it not just me

653
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:14,280
 there was one more thing i was going to say on on the actual star um so one of the reasons it's

654
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:22,280
 difficult to read is that um as well as english it's got quite a lot of text in um spanish of

655
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,160
 which i have absolutely none though as a person of privilege i have quite a bit of French latin

656
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:32,280
 Portuguese and Italian so i got away with it um it's got quite a lot of it in a Belize Creole

657
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,880
 and i went i bet if i just read these words out loud it'll be fine and it was um it's got quite

658
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:46,920
 a lot of stuff in a future invented language in a future invented language that is based on spanish

659
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:53,720
 and for which there is a glossary i gleaned nearly all of those from context so all of this makes it

660
00:53:53,720 --> 00:54:00,120
 a little bit tricky in a kind of it doesn't read through like an invention of all words so

661
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,560
 so if if you like if you like science fiction it's very easy to read this one might not be for you

662
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:11,000
 some people do bounce off that fortunately i have quite a lot of Spanish at this point so i should

663
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,240
 be all right with the spanish bits i am very glad i'm still very annoyed that my school decided that

664
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,120
 French German and latin were more sensible choices than spanish which i would argue is obvious nonsense

665
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:27,160
 it wasn't obvious nonsense when i was in school but it was obvious when i was in school in Texas

666
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,200
 that having spanish was very very useful i couldn't really switch because i already have french at

667
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:39,160
 that point it's clear now to me that a lot of actual creativity is happening in in the united

668
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:46,520
 states in spanish and as the u.s still has most of the cultural hegemony we probably do need to be

669
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:51,240
 learning some spanish in the same way that we do need to be learning some mandarin if we want to

670
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:56,680
 enjoy the next 20 or 30 years i will just say i also had like some french but it turns out if

671
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:01,960
 you just keep persistently learning spanish all the french goes away eventually that was the octa

672
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,080
 thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

673
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:27,240
 [Music]

674
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,920
 oh i do like a good milks that actually i mean not here obviously here i drink lager with ice in it

675
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,960
 yeah but but for easter so whoever wants to brew us beer for easter con i'm sure we can

676
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,600
 sell a few cans um and it could be the octa thought milk stout and then you could do an oat

677
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:51,400
 you could do an oat meal stout called oat to thorp and you could that would be good

678
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,440
 yes

679
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:05,160
 so your milk stout's lacto thorp is it uh i don't know no no i'm much prefer milk

680
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,880
 stout's that have milk in them or has lactose in them rather than milk stout's that don't

681
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,920
 that's legit i also i mean like i don't know what other beer styles what beer styles don't

682
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:21,080
 you guys like um crisp tylogger with like wedges of life though i would do if i was in

683
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:27,400
 tylod in 35 degree yeah yeah i was in tylod in 35 degree heat i would be googling flights to the

684
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:34,760
 uk i don't really like anything overly sour and i'm not keen on things which are overly

685
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:42,360
 hoppy either yeah no i don't like if you put so much hops of a particular type in your beer that

686
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:47,240
 it tastes like toilet cleaner then it tastes like toilet cleaner smells because i have no idea how

687
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:53,960
 toilet cleaner tastes then it's probably not for me so i i slightly worry about any beer with the

688
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:02,520
 word pine on the label yeah i i i am much the same uh as my co-hosts in that i i don't like very bitter

689
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:09,400
 hoppy beers very much um i do quite like incredibly sour beers though some inliz do differ there um

690
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:15,480
 but yes yeah it's like i can see the kind of the the craft and the artistry of making it a good

691
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:21,960
 like lambic i just don't like drinking them no and and like and i will say that like there are some

692
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,760
 beers lately that have been like double and triple IPAs that i have actually quite liked so i do think

693
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:33,400
 like beer makers are getting better at making very hoppy beers that are not just very hoppy if

694
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:39,800
 that makes sense um which i am kind of enjoying it's uh yeah what i just like is that i think of it

695
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:44,120
 as being a sort of American strand of brewing all that might be a total slight on the americans but

696
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:48,200
 i've definitely had it in some kind of american breweries where it's just a it just feels very

697
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:55,160
 bitter and not much else in there so i guess now we know what the aftershoe is going to be right

698
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,960
 maybe we shouldn't put that in because then all our american listeners will know maybe we should

699
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:04,040
 because then all american listeners will write into me with suggestions of beers i should drink

700
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:10,600
 and possibly even beers yes listeners please write in with a kind of beer tasting list a stretch

701
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:17,080
 goal for octa thought for 2022 is to drink more interesting beer and Liz will drink all of these

702
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,760
 interesting beers and she will not log any of them because she is not on untapped and you will be

703
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:28,760
 none the wiser listeners you will be in darkness and ignorance i am actually on i am actually on

704
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:36,120
 are you on untapped what shoot you're on the head taps whoa hang on did i know that i think i might

705
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,200
 have known that actually the last time i used untapped is when i was sat in the brewery with you

706
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:46,680
 guys drinking beer i think so you didn't really need to be on untapped nailed it do you not log

707
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:53,160
 all of your tylargas like tylarga definitely a lager Liz don't drink a lot i basically drink

708
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:57,720
 the same two or three and so it wouldn't be very interesting yeah i mean i don't tend to log like

709
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,400
 corona uh if i ever have a corona so that is fair i don't i don't tell the log except when

710
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:09,720
 chair gives me a paddington hardster not only is Liz on untapped but she's my friend on untapped so
