1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
 Before we get started, we'd just like to congratulate Phil Dyson and his team for being

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,080
 the seated Eastercon. Reclamation 2022 will be our next British National Science

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,040
 Fixing Convention and you can go and join now. There is a link in the show notes.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,920
 Alison appears to now be eating a bagel with jam on.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,160
 There is a long explanation for this. Is it that Steven toasted a bagel and put jam on it?

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,360
 That's like the last 8% of the long explanation. So if you'd like the rest of it, you can have it,

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,240
 but we do have a lot to get through. If you want the other 92% of that anecdote,

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,080
 please come to Octa Thought Live, which will be on 25th April 2021.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,200
 And when we will have nothing to talk about in fandom.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:01:00,880
 [Music]

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,640
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 29th episode of Octa Thought. A podcast for science fiction and

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,160
 science fiction fandom. This episode will be going out on the 15th of April 2021. I'm John Coxon.

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,840
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. Today we have two letters of comments,

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,440
 which is probably because it was Eastercon in between last episode and this episode. And so

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,120
 people have been busy partying and conventioning and other things.

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,520
 I would like to say that one of the things that happened at Eastercon is that people

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,560
 kept coming up to us as saying that they were enjoying the podcast and they thought it was good,

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,960
 including people that we had had no idea were listening to it at all. So if you're out there,

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,600
 A, thank you very much. And B, this does not prevent you from writing us letters.

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,840
 Yes, thank you very much for the compliments, but why don't you write to us? We're very needy.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,240
 Now, and there were actually quite a few people who said that they had not realised we were doing

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,200
 a podcast and have now started listening, which is kind of pleasing because I assumed that, you

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,040
 know, we had hit our absolutely peak listenership. So it is bewildering that apparently we had not.

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,360
 But DC wrote to us and said that they were feeling sad at the lack of opportunity at

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,480
 Eastercon to acquire delicious bits of chocolate late at night from Malcolm. And so they have

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:32,640
 attached a photograph of nine bars of lint chocolate to an email to us. And I am very jealous because

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,480
 I had Reese's peanut butter eggs for my Eastercon experience, which were great, but were not nine

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,240
 bars of lint chocolate. One of the things about lockdown is that my husband has to service a

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,760
 greater variety of needs than he might have been required to in pre pandemic time. Family show,

30
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,360
 Alison, family show. So as well as his normal requirement to provide me with an Easter egg

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,480
 over Easter, I let it be known before Easter that it would be very helpful if he also had a number of

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,080
 boxes of slightly cheap chocolate of the sort that Michael Amorthan's round and also a number of

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,920
 bars of the sort of chocolate that Malcolm Hutchison hands round to hand and provided me with some

34
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,920
 single variety, a couple of different single variety of chocolate. So they were very nice. So thank

35
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,720
 you very much, Steve, and you're your age. But this is what I'd recommend. We did go through

36
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,840
 Eastercon ago. What does what things do we normally have that had heart-sire Eastercon that we won't

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,880
 be getting unless we get them ourselves in advance? DC also says in the West Ring reference that they

38
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,160
 see me more as a Josh, but that's mainly because they envision me wearing little more than waders

39
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,040
 and bleerily asking what's happening. So thanks, DC. Much appreciated. And then they also say best

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,600
 wishes for the live podcast of OptaThorp, the tech that works. So yes, thanks, DC. We are going to be

41
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,880
 doing our live episode next episode, which will be on the 25th of April 2021.

42
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,560
 I don't think I have much to add except that obviously John, any time you would like to

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,280
 answer the podcast wearing only waders. That is totally fine with us. Please don't.

44
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,760
 Two very different opinions from my co-hosts on that, interestingly.

45
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,680
 And I would also like to highlight DC's tweet to us where they say they're still unconsciously

46
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,360
 saying Pete along with John at the end of the podcast. So listeners, you can all join in at home.

47
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:41,200
 Yes. And then other people who tweeted at us were Peter Sullivan, who agrees that having an

48
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,800
 overarching ed of communications for a convention is a good thing. Thanks, Peter. I'm glad you think so.

49
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,400
 And also volunteered, which is obviously a dangerous thing to do in here sort of John right now.

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,720
 That is true. That's very true. Jersey Griffin tweeted at us to say ambassador with these

51
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,120
 episodes who are really spoiling us, which I think is a chocolate reference. And when tweeted at us

52
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,640
 to say that they've just started listening to our podcast, and it's awesome looking forward to your

53
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,360
 chat on Father Ted, it will definitely one day happen. Just it might be like, you know, a couple

54
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,800
 of years away. We keep recording episodes, which you'd think would be a positive thing.

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,760
 Yeah, we should explain the Father Ted is our break glass in case it's well, it's part of the

56
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,200
 debate on our break glass in case of emergency podcasts, which is ready to be deployed. Should

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,840
 any of us not be available to podcast one fortnight, but evolving quite reliable so far.

58
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,920
 Yes. That's because two of us have not gone anywhere for a year. And that one time I did go

59
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,200
 somewhere I did make you podcasts at a different time. Yeah. And basically it's for when me and

60
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,920
 Alison are on a beach and Liz is in lockdown, which appears to be the trajectory in which things

61
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,480
 are heading, which is a bit weird. I have some beaches in mind and we should book that.

62
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,160
 Oh, just be me having a solo podcast. They're just being extremely grumpy while you guys send me,

63
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:12,080
 you know, pitch to the ocean. Fine, it's fine. Margay, Alison Margay, let's get this done.

64
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:19,280
 Oh, I love Margay. Oh, Dreamland, I can take you on the one of Britain's oldest rollercoats,

65
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,360
 one of the world's oldest rollercoasters except that the day that I went to Margayate,

66
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,640
 specifically so that I could ride the rollercoaster, it was shut.

67
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:34,240
 That is always the way. I will ride on it one day. I'm excited. We did also have a comment from

68
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,520
 Duncan McGregor on the diversity of gaming panels. I will say the gaming panel has got a lot more

69
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,600
 diverse when the program was finished. So that was good. The program was finished, I would say,

70
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,800
 at about noon on Saturday of EasterCon, maybe. But at that point, there was a lot more

71
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,960
 like different voices and stuff, which was very good to see. And if anyone is a member who didn't

72
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,920
 watch, I really recommend the accessibility on gaming podcast, which has some really interesting

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,520
 insights from the particular accessibility in games, which was really good.

74
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,280
 And then finally, we have a letter from Claire Briarley of Groiden.

75
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,840
 So, Claire says, "On your records, John claimed his bowling ball is a round black thing with a

76
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,480
 hole in the middle, but anyone who was a teenage reader of smash hits in the 1980s might suspect

77
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,040
 that Roy's got there as a licorice also. Taste, offensiveness and legality, well there's another

78
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,360
 comedy trio for you, but only you can decide if that's in the right order for you. I wonder if

79
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,520
 anyone got confused by the beeps and stopped the podcast before Alison's first hits.

80
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,480
 I don't know. I hope not. That would have been 1975, so you know, that's that.

81
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:53,920
 So, if it was taste, offensiveness and legality in order, I'm taste Alison's offensiveness and

82
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,560
 Liz's legality. And that doesn't. I don't know. I don't feel it's the worst match up of the three.

83
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,760
 Alison's making eyes at me, listener. Not the sort of eyes you're thinking of.

84
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,880
 Like googly eyes. Paddington hard stare eyes. No googly eyes. I'm telling you.

85
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,400
 And then Claire says, "I am safe from Jerry sending me more weed to mix," says John.

86
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,840
 Famous last words, worth repeating. Well, I have just repeated them, so well played Claire.

87
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,680
 But also, Jerry, please don't send me weed to mix. I would feel bad about the carbon footprint

88
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:43,120
 of that wee mix. We're going to talk about a topic in which we all sincerely and deeply believe.

89
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:51,360
 And that is Esther's Cat, Badger. Badger the cat is obviously the best cat in science fiction

90
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,760
 fandom. If you are listening to this thinking, "My cat is better," you are wrong. Badger is better.

91
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,320
 He's best cat. I have no skin in this game because unlike some of my co-hosts, I don't

92
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:12,960
 personally have a cat. So I can say that Badger is absolutely magnificent. He is a cat amongst cats.

93
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:26,080
 He is peerless in his majesty. He's quite the cat. He is perfect. He is excellent and handsome

94
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,760
 and high virtue and in need of praise. And he has given his name to a very, very, very tiny kitten,

95
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,040
 who hopefully can spend its life hoping to live up to the badgeriness of Big Badger.

96
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:49,280
 Yes. And as Esther notes, Badger is probably licking his bum right now, and he will be doing

97
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:57,360
 so in a glorious and fantastic way. I'm sure he could give lessons to other cats in how to lick their bottoms.

98
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,520
 I think we would all agree that if T.S. Eliot were still with us, the cat he would be writing about

99
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,080
 is Badger the Cat. But alas, he is not with us and so I have had to compose my own ode to Badger.

100
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:17,200
 Oh Badger Cat, you are so large and fond of sunbeams to recharge your energy. So when it's late,

101
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,760
 at Esther's jigsaw's lie in state, you sit on them with mighty weight because you are the best roommate.

102
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:32,800
 Badger, we love you. Badger's the best cat. Thank you very much to Esther for giving an enormous amount

103
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:40,000
 of money to the fanfons at the fanfon auction. Esther is as good a fan as Badger is a cat.

104
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,360
 Right, so launching in to the topics. We have thought about confusion. For those who don't know,

105
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:01,680
 confusion was the Eastercon of 2021, which occurred at Easter, which is last weekend as we record.

106
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:09,920
 We went to Eastercon. It was very like Eastercon. No, more like Eastercon than I was expecting.

107
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,880
 Yes. I got too drunk every day and stayed up till 2am.

108
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,600
 Yep, I did too. But it was also like Eastercon sufficiently much that I do wonder when the

109
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,800
 committee sat down and said, "It's not going to feel proper lie-like Eastercon unless we have a

110
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,720
 mad panic trying to get everything working in the first day of the convention." We have thoughts

111
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,160
 about confusion and what went well and what went badly. And we're going to kind of tackle them in

112
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,240
 kind of theme by theme and go through and say kind of the things we liked and the things we

113
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,960
 didn't like so much. So the first thing we're going to discuss is Eastercon's communications.

114
00:11:50,960 --> 00:12:00,960
 So I think Eastercon's communications strategy was idiosyncratic for an Eastercon. I think it

115
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,120
 relied on video and social media to an extent that we have not seen from previous Eastercons.

116
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,440
 In some ways that's a very modern take on how to convey information and in some ways I think

117
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,160
 that's to be applauded. But in other ways I think the reliance on video as a medium

118
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,880
 did frustrate some people, especially those people for whom video is not an accessible medium.

119
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,160
 And that was an interesting choice. And one I think that if I was going to do communications

120
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:42,560
 for an Eastercon I would probably not be doing it by video as a result. The other kind of hallmark

121
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,080
 of the Eastercon communication strategies I saw it was a desire to keep things very close to their

122
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,920
 chest. So we didn't find out until quite close to the convention that they were planning to use

123
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,400
 GAVA and kind of a lot of things like program items started to be trailed in the two weeks before

124
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,040
 the convention which was quite close to the convention. And that was again that was a decision that I

125
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,240
 think they made to kind of stoke anticipation. But I think in some quarters that I was seeing

126
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,680
 discussion it was actually stoking worry which I think was not what they were trying to achieve.

127
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,320
 And so I think my two takeaways from their communication strategy is that secrecy is I

128
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,920
 think probably overrated. I think it's better to have people getting excited about all the cool

129
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,160
 stuff you're doing rather than getting excited about all the cool stuff you might announce eventually.

130
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,240
 And it's also probably better not to focus on methods of dissemination that are

131
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,280
 potentially accessibility issues. I think I broadly agree with you. I think that where I disagree

132
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,240
 about video is that using video would be absolutely the right way when they had for example videos

133
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,720
 introducing like GAVA as a platform. And those kind of tutorial videos I think are really helpful.

134
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,560
 Like I know for punctuation we did kind of very sort of text and screenshot heavy instructions on

135
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,840
 how you are going to access our different platforms. But it was maybe the video introducing things

136
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,160
 that was the most useful for people to go and go and watch. But I agree that if you're going to do

137
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,760
 that one I think you need to really try and have a transcript up at the same time because there's

138
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,600
 nothing worse than having a video playing and finding that everyone else is kind of you know able to

139
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,120
 look at this video and get all the information out. And if videos are not accessible to you then

140
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,960
 you're sort of left in the dark and you don't want any. If you want to get people excited you don't

141
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,640
 want them to be sad because they can't be excited with long with everyone else because you haven't

142
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,280
 provided the information and media making access. And yeah just to sort of general overline some

143
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,040
 video and also kind of the expectation that we're going to do weekly videos and then it was sort

144
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,480
 of there were three videos and then they stopped. I think it was a bit of a problem because you're

145
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,760
 sort of waiting for the next video and thinking oh well I'm sure there'll be more detail in the

146
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,880
 next video but there wasn't the next video. And maybe if you had an easier sort of more text-based

147
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,440
 strategy it's less effort. You wouldn't have to be waiting to try and make a video and it's

148
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,320
 good that some of the people who are making the videos were also the people who were trying to do

149
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,880
 the rest of the convention. So I think there's ways you could do videos but do them in a slightly

150
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,040
 different way that would be more helpful. That's actually a phenomenal point which I hadn't considered

151
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,840
 which is the point about if you're going to make videos which are quite difficult and quite

152
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,120
 intensive I lack the skill to do them which is why we did not do them for punctuation. Having

153
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,760
 someone do them that is not also either trying to run every part of the communications or trying

154
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,840
 to build the tech stack is probably a good thing. So yes very very good point Alison.

155
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:33,520
 So I ran social media for Mankynicon which was six years ago now but we actually had to stop our

156
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,120
 social media strategy before it really got going because the convention was clearly going to fill

157
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,400
 its space but one of the reasons that was was the social media strategy which was basically

158
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,720
 we won't think about it too hard but we will keep tweeting out and and sharing interesting things

159
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,720
 with membership was was actually generating all the buzz that we needed and the convention would be

160
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,120
 full. This convention didn't do that so you talked about them relying on social media but they

161
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,320
 they hardly tweeted at all or made any posts in the first five months of running the convention.

162
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,360
 So there's about one post a month until you get to the point where they say we're going virtual

163
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,200
 and then there was nothing more after that for about three months and I this is the point where I

164
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,680
 go if I had done it I would have tried to do it differently and I think part of what went wrong

165
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,280
 for them there is that they were being very concerned about controlling the message so that

166
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,440
 they didn't give the I'm surmising I don't know how to talk to Zoe about this if you're listening

167
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,120
 Zoe please get in touch and tell all or to actually don't tell all just tell the nice bits.

168
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,200
 I didn't feel that they had a social media tomb who felt empowered which is a very crappy

169
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:58,480
 management word but didn't feel able to just have that slight frivolity that you need in order to

170
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,800
 do social media well that you need to be able to go with whatever the flow of this is happening

171
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,560
 at the time and you need to be quite regular about it and you don't need to make sure that

172
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,440
 every single word has been cleared back through the committee and chair because it's quite easy

173
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,600
 to take things down and apologize if you stuff up obviously you don't want to do it too spectacularly.

174
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:23,760
 What that led to was partly it it reflected this kind of sense of secrecy that we weren't being

175
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,920
 told because they actually didn't want Eastacom members to know what the Eastacom was going to

176
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,960
 be like which is weird especially if not if you're trying to build membership they were kind of like

177
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
 we're desperate to get more members it's going to be great but without actually telling anyone

178
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,680
 anything about anything it's very hard to make that happen but also when they do kind of go

179
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,600
 we're not telling you anything but the theme is fun and whimsy and you've just had eight months or

180
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,640
 ten months of a social media strategy that has never once showed the slightest

181
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,920
 twinge of fun or whimsy that that provides a kind of disconnect in the in the readers and the

182
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,960
 members that make them go fun whimsy is that is that what you're about that's not what we get

183
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,840
 and in fact they did have their actual branding was quite fun and whimsical they had like rocket

184
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,960
 ships and cute fountains and all of that cuteness that was that was doing that but but I think

185
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,560
 unless your communications reflect that all the way through people aren't really going to believe

186
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,000
 you and I think that's what happened I think people didn't believe they were going to have fun

187
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,520
 if they came to the convention and a lot of people didn't come as a result so so I it's not how I

188
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,080
 would have done it yeah I think that all seems fair and I think this is one thing when people

189
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,560
 think they've got an excellent thing that they need to surprise people with they forget that actually

190
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,520
 secrecy is not the most important thing the most important thing is excitement and there is more

191
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,600
 than one way to generate excitement and one of those things is by telling people why they should

192
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,360
 be excited and I think that is almost the antithesis of secrecy and they're both valid

193
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,920
 ways of doing it but when it becomes people if it becomes clear that people are more

194
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,880
 aggravated than excited about your secrecy that might be the point of which you switch

195
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,120
 tack perhaps and I think what you were saying Alison about the lack of flexibility and responsiveness

196
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,480
 in social media is slightly I think touching on that and I think I think it's probably fair for

197
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,240
 me to share this on the podcast now so I I actually approached Eastcom before we ran punctuation to

198
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,600
 set up the discord and I did most of the initial work on their discord but I eventually left the

199
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:41,760
 team because I was working under Zoe as the kind of head of social media but I I was not able to

200
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,960
 have discussions with her at which decisions were made because decisions had to be passed back

201
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,600
 up the chain so it'd be a week between me suggesting something and me hearing from Zoe whether or

202
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,440
 not that was something we could do and I just found it so frustrating that I eventually left

203
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,320
 because I was like I can't I just feel like I'm moving through treacle and I'm not used to that

204
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,560
 kind of thing in a in something like running a discord or a social media thing where I feel

205
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:10,000
 like responsiveness is is an incredibly key component of doing that and that's not a slight

206
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,680
 on how they did it necessarily but it was definitely something I felt was not fun for me.

207
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,880
 I have one more point on surprise and then let's get have a go which is that there are some sorts

208
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,440
 of surprise that are lovely like when I left the United States when I was 18 my friends can try

209
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,760
 to give me a massive surprise party on my last night and I was not expecting it at all and that's

210
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:41,760
 a lovely surprise. When I am thinking about how to attend an event I haven't attended before the

211
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,400
 information about how you're going to get there how you're going to park what the arrangements are

212
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,440
 for meals where you camp or in this case how you log on to this exactly what services you're going

213
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,720
 to be using exactly what sort of computer you'll need these are not part of a lovely surprise

214
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:10,560
 so they should have been extremely much more open and earlier with things like these you'll be

215
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,600
 doing it in a browser you'll need a computer that's got these sorts of specs to make it work here are

216
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,400
 the problems that other people sometimes have with these programs and the ways in which you

217
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,760
 can solve them lots of lots of that I've just been past a link that I haven't managed to follow yet

218
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:33,040
 for a convention that used Gather that that has a single page with very clear instructions for all

219
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,000
 parts of the convention on it and I'm like oh that's good and and and Easter can't have these things

220
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,200
 but I don't think they released them until like the Friday a lot more different if we'd actually

221
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,200
 handle that material one week earlier and this isn't again it's not the fault for the publications

222
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,320
 lead because it was the fault of decisions not being made early enough because so many

223
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,960
 decisions had to be made at committee level the next thing we're going to talk about is

224
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,920
 technology at the East Com so we're going to segregate this into two different technologies

225
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,680
 we're going to segregate into streaming technology so the stuff they use to deliver their program

226
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,600
 panels and then we're going to also discuss social technology basically the discord and the Gather

227
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,040
 so let's start with the streaming technology East Com was very quiet about what tech stack

228
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,080
 they were using but I had a couple of meetings with Keith Smith who was the head of tech just a bit

229
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,240
 a few days before the Easter Com where he surfaced quite a lot of that in the meeting and also

230
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,920
 Zoe mentioned that they were using one one element of that thing which is is red B which is a very

231
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:45,440
 high-end content distribution system that like the BBC uses and things like that they were also

232
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:55,360
 using a program called VMix as the kind of front-end mixer and overall there were many I heard

233
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:05,840
 22 Keith said 22 to me different programs in the stack that got you from you in your house out to

234
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,960
 the person on the stream and they decided I think this was a committee level decision rather than a

235
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:21,760
 decision in tech that they were going to use this stack for all of their programs so essentially

236
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,960
 every program item apart from a few readings in Gather was going to be done by running it through

237
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,160
 this stack and that meant that it ended up getting used for quite a lot of events that would have

238
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,680
 been much better with a more interactive technology and this is partly because the convention had a

239
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,440
 huge vision the committee had a bit vision of what the convention would be like and how it would

240
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:56,320
 operate that meant that they then didn't always make the right decision for particular program

241
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,680
 items about how they would best run and this is effectively mostly with the fanfans auction where

242
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,520
 people had stream lag of up to two minutes which made it very difficult for them to bid on things

243
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,080
 it was a very successful auction the tech crew and prog ops worked with us incredibly hard to make

244
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,360
 it good it was you know and as did as did the actual fanfans teams but the they should not have

245
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,120
 had to do that amount of work and it would have just been much better running zoom it's just

246
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,720
 about an example of something where the tech stack was far too ambitious for the thing that was being

247
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,760
 was being streamed and it would have been better if it hadn't been streamed at all other conventions

248
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,000
 have dealt with this by having everything on interactive technologies like zoom or by having

249
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,760
 much simpler streaming stacks i think this is the most complicated streaming stack that any

250
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,240
 virtual convention has tried and i think the result was that nobody was trained so once it

251
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,960
 worked it worked pretty well for most things not the fanfans auction but for most things it worked

252
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,880
 really well but that nobody was trained i think the mistake they made was that they bought an

253
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,240
 awful lot of technologies that were paid for by the minute or by the hour rather than buying

254
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,680
 technologies that were bought by the month for instance and then they decided that it would be

255
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:30,240
 a waste of money to pay for those far enough in advance of the convention to properly onboard

256
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,560
 volunteers with how those technologies worked and i think one of those two decisions was a huge

257
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,120
 mistake i don't know which one and i wasn't privy to the discussions in the convention

258
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,520
 but certainly i think if your tech stack and your budget for your tech stack requires that

259
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,920
 the first time you start training people on it is the day of the convention then that is a tech

260
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:01,280
 stack that is not going to work well with the net effect that the convention effectively started

261
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,120
 a day late because the program items on friday and saturday morning just didn't really work and

262
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,360
 i'm sympathetic so i asked a question in the feedback session about why didn't you use something

263
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,920
 like stream yard and keith very reasonably said well stream yard didn't offer everything we needed

264
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,400
 and i will say that i'm sure that is true but the advantage they would have

265
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,680
 the advantage they would have had with stream yard is that it is paid by the month and so they

266
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,160
 would have had the ability to familiarize their staff and so i am wondering and the question i

267
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:37,440
 asked is is the features that you got from this tech stack that you couldn't have got with more

268
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:45,680
 simple tools worth the human cost to your volunteers and attendees because there was one and it seems

269
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,960
 like you're prioritizing bells and whistles over stressing people out on the day they're trying

270
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,400
 to get their program to work and that i think is something we've seen spill over onto for example

271
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,640
 the anonymous claire discord and in a lot of the discussion of what was happening at the convention

272
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,920
 i think i agree both you and you have stolen some of my talking points um i think i want to say that

273
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,800
 there's nothing wrong with being ambitious like they are right in that you know certainly

274
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,720
 some conventions have used very simple methods you either have a big zoom room or you have one of

275
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,760
 the simpler simpler streaming methods like stream yard or so on and they are limited and they do

276
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,760
 have issues and particularly they identify i think that you can't really play long videos within

277
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,960
 stream yard you then have to go and you know play them off another basically off another tab

278
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,800
 which works okay um but not always and and it's things like you know we can note a punctuation that

279
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,360
 one of our items basically got dropped from youtube because we were trying to play short video clips

280
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,880
 off something else and they got pulled which is not a not going to be a problem if you're running

281
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,160
 your own content distribution but yeah i think it's obvious that there was kind of a big mismatch

282
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:58,480
 between the ambition they had and the actual amount of person time they could afford to budget to pull

283
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:06,560
 it off and then what is interesting is i don't know when they chose to use that tech setup and it

284
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,800
 feels to me that either they needed to put more money into the tech setup in order to have more

285
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,960
 time to familiarize themselves with it but that again would have made them an extremely

286
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,720
 expensive streaming only convention or they need at some point to make the decision of

287
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,880
 okay we can't do all these things we're going to have to say no we're going to run things

288
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,560
 slightly differently and cut some of that out and i know that's really hard to do especially

289
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,200
 lay on but you've got to wonder sort of are you so committed to doing this thing that you keep

290
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,560
 carrying on even when it's becoming obvious that it's not quite going to pull off and i should say

291
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,760
 also that from about saturday afternoon most things were working perfectly well and if everything

292
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,960
 had worked that well from friday morning it would have just been you know the occasional hiccup the

293
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,000
 occasional stream that needed restarting or rebooting and it would have been fine it only became so

294
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,400
 obvious when you know we got saturday morning and i was doing program ops on an item which was not

295
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,920
 being broadcast live we were just doing it on the assumption that we could record it and then some

296
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,920
 people might watch it later which meant there were no questions because that people would have

297
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,600
 to ask questions without seeing the item and things like that in case this ever happens to you in the

298
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,920
 future i have a tip which is that i went into the discord halfway through my item being recorded

299
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,680
 without the chance of everyone for anyone to be asked questions and i went into this

300
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,680
 court and said obviously you can't see what we said so far but does anyone have any questions and we

301
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,080
 came up with half a dozen really good questions so you know i mean i did ask for them but that was

302
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,200
 a slightly different item like you can't ask for questions on a it was the item about like um

303
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,560
 what is punk in fiction and it was an extremely sort of free form wide range discussion and there

304
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,520
 was no way to predict like from the description where the panelists would take it and what

305
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,720
 be sent for questions to ask and then i think it would be even worse if i'd said well we have a

306
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,600
 question here is a question it relates to nothing at all you said on the panel what would you like

307
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,320
 to answer anyway you may be better off not even having the questions at that point yeah and like i

308
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,840
 say this all comes back to their decisions the decisions that they made not to have that day of

309
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,880
 training which would have made it all fine and it's something we were telling them up to the convention

310
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,760
 and i was doing my best to stay optimistic and sort of saying you know we're being very critical

311
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,640
 but i'm sure they've got it under control and then it's after the convention and they didn't and

312
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:28,400
 you know that is a problem and i don't know whose problem it was but i think it think it's worth

313
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,400
 coming back to and saying yeah that that is something you can't do that does make the beginning of your

314
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,600
 convention full of argument stress and bad feeling instead of full of excitement joy and happiness

315
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,320
 which is the feelings i associate with her convention and the feelings you should be aiming

316
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,720
 to instill um a really crystallizing moment for me was when we were in the newsletter on Saturday

317
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,600
 morning and they just decided that they were going to not run program on Saturday morning

318
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,520
 and i said well you know what it seems like an odd choice to say we're going to take the program

319
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,520
 down completely when it would take 200 quid and about 20 minutes to get to the entire thing set up

320
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:17,200
 on zoom and uh lina there's been a lot of discussion about there's been a lot of fallout about

321
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,640
 easter con and the sorts of decisions that were made and why all over my smeads and in one of them

322
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:35,600
 lina thane clark said and i thought this was very wise um it's all very well um members coming up

323
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,680
 with buckets of water but sometimes from the point of view of the committee they're just coming along

324
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,640
 with buckets of paraffin to throw on the fire and i feel that my suggestion that i could pick the

325
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,200
 whole thing up and put it on zoom in 20 minutes might have been one of those buckets of paraffin i

326
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,680
 think it was a bucket of water i feel like they got into a hole and they carried on digging out

327
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,560
 that hole rather than going oh no let's get the convention up and running and then we can and

328
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,240
 then we can sort the the whizzy stuff out in the background while we just meanwhile run the

329
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,160
 convention using a less good system but you know that's me and not them so obviously i do respect

330
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,000
 their right to decide it was better have no program at all and one that wasn't perfect i also have

331
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,600
 one point about the particular tech stack that they ended up with which is that it was possible for

332
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:34,320
 random people on being given a link by saying overtired program ops member of staff or because

333
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,040
 tech ops are given the wrong link to program ops or because they just clicked the wrong link in

334
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:45,120
 their email and find themselves parachuted live onto a totally different program item

335
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,680
 thereby bumping off someone who was on that program item and for me that was not fit for

336
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:58,800
 purpose you should not be able to do that is that okay yeah i think i think that's all fair and i

337
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,440
 think ultimately it's very difficult to second guess the decisions they made in the heat in the

338
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:10,080
 moment and i don't want to i i don't want to nitpick decisions that were made kind of on Saturday

339
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,120
 morning when they were trying to put all the fires out because i i do want to say i think i think

340
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,960
 they should have done things differently in terms of the lead up but i don't want to say that

341
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,720
 i know what they should have done then because i think that was an incredibly difficult thing

342
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,080
 because obviously the counterpoint to well you could just do it through zoom which is possibly

343
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,040
 true is that then you don't get on holodeck so i think you've got a um it's a difficult question

344
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:37,200
 right and one we're talking about um for punctuation to washermat that was hope um he's like is it more

345
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,000
 important why don't you get you just record the zoom i don't know how difficult that would have been

346
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,560
 and you don't either it may have been difficult to do it across all the program items we know they

347
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,880
 managed it for the bid session but they may not have been you know there to snap into action have

348
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,880
 seven people record them and ready yeah yeah they did of course take a very long time to get

349
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,440
 stuff onto holodeck anyway so that's another thing that it was not because of all the other

350
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,400
 problems attack it it it didn't cut up get up and running as fast as ideally you do want stuff on

351
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,240
 holodeck within a couple of hours i think probably so the next thing that we're going to pull out

352
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,960
 and discuss in a little bit more detail is gather which was the conventions primary kind of virtual

353
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,840
 space slash social space um i know we've discussed this on previous shows but it's basically sort of

354
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,440
 looks like a little sort of uh top-down 8-bit video game style uh layout where you pick a little

355
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,600
 avatar and there's a physical space that you can wander around and as you wander close to people

356
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,520
 their video is an audio pop-up so you can hear them and as you wander further away they get

357
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,920
 quieter and drift away and confusion has set it up with a really kind of nice big elaborate sort of

358
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:55,040
 space space station setup um and it had lots of cool little things it had all the rooms where you

359
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,440
 could watch the program in in gather if you wanted to you know and go and find like the art show and

360
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,440
 a little dealers room but it also had cool things like uh there was an observation dome um there

361
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,720
 were as an alboretum where of course we all kept leaving our avatars hiding under trees

362
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,680
 there were hidden things like hidden rooms and mazes and shortcuts and teleportation and just

363
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:22,000
 generally like clearly an awful lot of effort had gone into producing it but i'm not sure i used

364
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,440
 that much of the stuff they've made yes i think that's probably a fair point i have things

365
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:38,160
 okay so i i really wish proximity chat worked it almost does there's quite a few different

366
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,560
 place things in the space i've been told about a new one i need to go try gathers

367
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:49,440
 not quite there yet but that i loved you know you could wander past somebody in the corridor and

368
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,320
 stop for a conversation and and that feels that feels like an experience i have hugely missed for

369
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,560
 the last year and i loved being able to do that i mean i do like gather a lot and i liked gather here

370
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:09,520
 but gathers primarily a social tool and so therefore when you're designing and building the gather

371
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,360
 i think the energy should go into designing the social spaces i don't think most people care about

372
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,440
 tardis isn't his and major mazes and you know things like the arborita was very nice

373
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,320
 so so scenery i think is is probably quite useful but i think a lot of the easter eggs

374
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,320
 didn't work as well as they thought people didn't make us spend as much time exploring the gather

375
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,000
 because people are mostly there to see their friends and i think i would have liked to have seen

376
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,880
 more energy put into thinking how you engineer social spaces in gather so that you can so they

377
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,880
 work as effectively as possible and and i don't feel that that was the and i guess this is very

378
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,760
 much a personal choice rather the conventions choice but it's um i don't feel that didn't feel

379
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,600
 to me to be where the center of the energy in designing the gather went that's yeah i think that's

380
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:07,840
 fair um i really enjoyed the gather space in general um i think that i i was always i think the most

381
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,520
 optimistic of the three of us about the use of gather because i've used it professionally and

382
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,800
 usually enjoyed it in that context but i think the moment at which it kind of crystallized for me

383
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,280
 that actually i really enjoyed this was when i was going from newsletter to the dealer's room to

384
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:28,720
 ask someone a question and i bumped into um mark and come with the other person was but mark plumber

385
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,000
 and someone else were talking in the corridor and i bumped into them when we had a chat and i said

386
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,800
 hi and we all kind of chat for five minutes and then someone from the newsletter pinged me on this

387
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,520
 go to be like oikox and where have you gone and i got on with what i was supposed to be doing um

388
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,720
 and but i think that it was that kind of thing where i was like this is the sort of thing that

389
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:51,440
 happens at a real convention that has not happened to me in any zoom or discord i've been on and i

390
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,840
 do think that that mode of interaction is a good one and and having a tool that can capture that

391
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:04,320
 is wonderful i now want to launch into the pessimistic bit gather needs to sort out their

392
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,840
 accessibility story and it's bananas to me that they haven't done it kind of made sense in april

393
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,160
 2020 that they hadn't done because they were very new and everything was moving very quickly but

394
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,120
 look at how much work zoom has done to substantially improve their offering in the last year and

395
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,240
 compare and contrast together and you're like what are they doing there are key low hanging no not

396
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,960
 low hanging fruit there are key requirements for members of our community to be able to access

397
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,520
 services that gather just have not bothered to implement and that is and i think they need to

398
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,520
 he said as an able-bodied white guy but like it really frustrates me because i want the whole

399
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,600
 community to feel able to partake in this tool that i enjoyed using and it really i feel uncomfortable

400
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,920
 suggesting it for conventions i want to run because i know that i'm being exclusionary if i do so

401
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,360
 despite the fact that i enjoyed it for me i really really wish that it was accessible to everyone

402
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,080
 if you're out there listening to octa thought and you know of a proximity chat system that has a

403
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,200
 good accessibility story to tell which would certainly include working on mobiles and tablets

404
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:16,560
 please um can you get in touch because i am actively trying out every one i can find at the moment

405
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,480
 yes that would be very good of course i too love i love proximity chat i think it's really good

406
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,920
 i think i think my final thought and gather is that i also think it's very difficult to design a space

407
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,320
 where you intend there to be sort of several hundreds at max little avatars running around

408
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,120
 when you're trying to design it probably with a very smaller set of people to test it so i mean i

409
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:47,760
 like the big spaces in the gather but they are horrendous for slowing down my system such that i

410
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,160
 had to put on quiet mode so i didn't see everyone's proximity videos or i just couldn't move around

411
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,920
 but then when i got in some of the smaller spaces it felt a bit like oh now is now actually a little

412
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,520
 bit small and everyone's trying to squeeze around a table so i'm not sure that you know i think we

413
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,720
 say it would have been nice if they could have done different things to it but i think this

414
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,400
 was very much a sort of first experiment and i don't blame them for trying what they did and then

415
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,240
 i'm sure if they had to redesign it they would do things differently and i will just very quickly

416
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,000
 note that part of my um screed about accessibility should have been i do wish gather was not a

417
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,560
 web app because i think it would be much more accessible to people on less well-spected computers

418
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,600
 if it was being written in kind of native code and not being done in a web stack because at the

419
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,800
 moment it's very CPU intensive and then there was the discord and the discord was good it wasn't big

420
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,160
 enough and what this led to was every time someone said oh hey i wish you had this channel i posted a

421
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,080
 link to anonymous claire which had that channel and then people joined anonymous claire with the net

422
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,160
 effect that we have about 50 new members over the weekend so if you're listening to this because

423
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,560
 you've seen me link it on anonymous claire hello welcome we're happy you're here we like to the

424
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,040
 hoyland uh watch along isn't it fun having all these people here oh boy oh boy oh golly i i just had

425
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,040
 a word with somebody who's worked on nine world's tech and i said anyone else who's ever worked on

426
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,360
 nine words tech would probably be very welcome on an anonymous claire so it's possible that

427
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:21,440
 anonymous claire is just going to kind of generally grow now until it becomes a focal point for uk

428
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,040
 fandom and i for one would be very happy about that um we're not going to put a link in the

429
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,040
 show notes but if you don't yet have an invite to anonymous claire get in touch with one of us

430
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,160
 and we'll see you straight i'm very happy with that except i realized i started being a waterway

431
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,240
 term anonymous claire when it had like six members and now i need to consider the fact that it may have

432
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,880
 uh i don't know 250 members i will say that while i feel the anonymous claire discord

433
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,960
 definitely filled a niche for what people wanted at easter con it was a shame that it couldn't have

434
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,200
 been provided through easter con it feels a bit like they got a discord and we know from

435
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,280
 punctuation that you have to work quite hard to get your members onto discords a lot of the time

436
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,760
 and so you'd only have part of the membership there but then felt that actually during easter it

437
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,680
 would be too hard to try and keep the discord running as well and so they wanted people to move

438
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,080
 together except that then the discord did keep running and it seemed like the easiest way to

439
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:21,280
 get any sort of tech problems or other issue solve was to come and mention them on discord so

440
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,720
 it felt a bit like it was sort of an official but unofficial space it was it was the formal help

441
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,560
 test for the convention they didn't really have an ops room that you went to get help with they

442
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,200
 did have that but as i think Liz noted when john dod said people aren't coming to the ops room and

443
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,960
 we've got loads of people who could help you there and Liz quite rightly said yes but if i'm watching

444
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,480
 a program item in program room one that isn't working i could either walk to the ops room and

445
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,120
 ask you about it or i could copy and paste things into this box that is here while i am in that

446
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,760
 program room and i do wonder i think this is one of the very good examples of where the easter con

447
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,160
 did not correctly assess how they could use the fact they were virtual in ways that did not limit

448
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,960
 themselves to the like physical space limitations they would usually have because one of the great

449
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,160
 benefits of virtual is that the help desk can be like disconnected from the physical space of

450
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,320
 the convention in a way that makes it more accessible and i think the fact that we saw the discord

451
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:23,440
 so full of people asking ops questions and the ops room was apparently according to the manager

452
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,520
 of ops always completely empty for the whole weekend really shows that this is one way in which

453
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,480
 people are quite happy to take advantage of the fact it's virtual and not limited to physical space

454
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:40,080
 i think the other thing that they tried to replicate sort of a physical easter con in gather was by

455
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:45,120
 having ops rovers so there were ops rovers i think wandering around the gather the problem is because

456
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,440
 gather doesn't let you kind of sort the list of people there in any way the only way to find the

457
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,520
 ops rover was sort of to scroll through this list of names and find out who would tag themselves

458
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,200
 ops rover and it was nowhere near as useful as if you're at an actual convention and you can go

459
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,360
 and find a person carrying a radio and wearing a sash and figure out who is in charge of things

460
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,920
 so that i think was a physical thing that just doesn't carry over and and didn't feel useful you

461
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,680
 could just have the ops rover hanging around in ops and if you got a message through saying

462
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,160
 you know help someone stuck it in a tree in the arboretum you could then send their little avatar

463
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,600
 over i don't think you could get stuck in a tree in the arboretum but wouldn't it be cool if you could

464
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,880
 it was clearly a design choice from the convention to replicate the physical convention

465
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,160
 as far as they possibly could and this worked well for me in some ways because it meant that when

466
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,000
 we asked them if we could have a newsletter room they were like oh yeah yeah you could have a newsletter

467
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,200
 room and that turned out to be quite useful for us because it was quite a nice place to to hang out

468
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,480
 and do newsletter and talk to people with newsletter items and so on but it also meant that they made

469
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,920
 some decisions that were frankly really terrible like paying for i assume a program called zello

470
00:44:52,480 --> 00:45:00,800
 which implements walkie talkie functionality between staff now most staff i mean walkie talkies have

471
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,680
 been a bit of a an unpleasant essential at least comes for some time but if you have a discord where

472
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,280
 you can type things you you don't really need a walkie talkie system because you can just check

473
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,800
 the discord and then one other thing on discord which is there have been a lot of different virtual

474
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,040
 conventions over the last year and they've run in lots of different ways but one thing that's I think

475
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:31,200
 almost everyone would agree with is that having text threads that collect all the thoughts that have

476
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,560
 the people have during and after program items and that you can go in later and go

477
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,320
 oh that looks like a good program item i should catch it on replay um i mean those those are

478
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:47,920
 incredibly positive and i've i think easter con not having them when they could perfectly well have

479
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:57,040
 them was i think a kind of a monumental goal and and i think they thought that gather chat would be

480
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:03,600
 reasonably a good reasonably good alternative to discord chat but gather chat isn't persistent

481
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:09,280
 it only kind of happens when you're ready to then the only thing you see is your chatter that it

482
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,960
 only saves so many messages so so you can't actually go all the way back through your chat so it doesn't

483
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:22,080
 create a record of information on a topic um so i think that was a bit of a mistake and i think they

484
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:28,000
 didn't need to make it it's not very hard to moderate discords for easter con type people i think

485
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,600
 big discord servers with ordinary people on them not ordinary people thought again big discord

486
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,240
 servers with teenage gamers on speed on them can be quite hard to moderate because they can be an

487
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,680
 awful lot of kind of spammy threads and meme threads and people posting completely outrageous

488
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,160
 stuff and i think if you've come from discord from that direction you can be quite surprised by how

489
00:46:50,160 --> 00:47:02,320
 sedate convention discords tend to be so um let's talk program and art show um so i liked the program

490
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:09,360
 uh the bits that i saw kind of after saturday morning i thought good and i enjoyed um some of

491
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,800
 the program items very much um and i thought the art show was fantastic they used a piece of

492
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:21,120
 software called const matrix um which was cool um and let you kind of imagine that you were in a

493
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:28,320
 real art gallery uh my one criticism of const matrix is that i think it introduced a disconnect

494
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:34,640
 between viewing the art and buying the art that i think um especially my my wife was a bit curious

495
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:42,560
 as to how well the popularity of the art show had converted into sales for artists i do not know

496
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,960
 how well it did that so if you are an artist who exhibited and sold things or didn't sell things at

497
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,440
 east con please do write in and let us know how you feel that went because we'd be very interested

498
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:57,280
 um the program i thought was very good the panel items i saw were very cool you could watch them by

499
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,160
 going to the room in gather and kind of watching them in the room there um but what actually happened was

500
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,680
 if you are on a Mac and you watch things as a video in safari you can pop it out and have it as a

501
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,000
 little window that like hovers over all your other windows in the corner of your screen and so i was

502
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,800
 kind of wandering around uh the gather or doing the newsletter or whatever with the program item just

503
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,600
 kind of constantly playing in my upper right hand corner and that was amazing i really liked that

504
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:27,520
 we'll just call you chris gossier chris didn't even lock us this time allison so frankly he's

505
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,800
 persona non grata until he gets back on the horse you know who did lock us clair bryley of croydon

506
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:41,440
 right anyway so um yeah but in general i really like them i have no real criticisms of either thing

507
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:47,600
 other than that very small question about um comparing into art sales so i would say that actually

508
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,880
 how i watched the program a lot of time is sometimes i had it open on the second screen on my desktop

509
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:00,480
 because i've got a laptop and desktop setup oh fancy um i actually discovered that if i

510
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:07,440
 logged into program on the browser on my amazon tv stick that worked perfectly well it wouldn't work

511
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,680
 on my playstation for some reason and it wouldn't work on my chrome cast for some reason but it was

512
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,360
 quite happy with the random amazon browser anyway so that that worked fine um so i did that quite a

513
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,080
 lot uh a few items i will call out for being particularly good is oh i really enjoyed the hay

514
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:30,000
 lecture which was about sort of um forensic archaeology and about burial practices and it was really

515
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,840
 interesting and there is a horrible analogy about popcorn i recommend you go and look up

516
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,640
 uh this is probably alison and john because i should say the program is only available till the 12th

517
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,280
 of april and we'll be down by the time you listen to this podcast but you know they also had a couple

518
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,240
 of panels which i'm not sure where the panelists were but they may have been difficult to pull

519
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,240
 together so many experts at an easter con i think they did make good use of the virtuality of the

520
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,560
 convention by getting some people to pop in for a panel or a couple of items who you would definitely

521
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:08,640
 not normally see at an easter con and who very much enhanced the easter con so i thought that was

522
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,560
 pretty good quite clever good choice good good choice of panelists on lots and lots of items

523
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,800
 the one i was specifically pulled out that i i watched later on actually and enjoyed was panel

524
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,680
 about jinnyong works in place in chinese literature which is about hong kong's most famous novelist

525
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,480
 who i was not aware of before the convention um but now might go and try and check out some

526
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,680
 translations and there are yeah there were just generally quite a few good program items there

527
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:42,000
 are also fun ones i watched the one which is like is it about 80s pop lyric or a warhammer 40k

528
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,680
 space marine uh line and uh yeah it was very cleverly done because obviously some of them were

529
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,560
 were one only that are both sometimes and also included ones that the people on the panel

530
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,080
 had written and occasionally forgotten so that was quite fun um

531
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:02,880
 excellent and they all work fine it also may realize it's so that you can do a sort of virtual

532
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,120
 fun quiz show because you don't need to have like buzzers you can just have everywhere on the

533
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,880
 panel has like i think they had little um like ray toy ray guns that made a noise and so you could

534
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,240
 use that to be like your buzzer and you could just have them at home and you just suddenly hold

535
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:21,360
 up your little buzzer and buzz in so that was neat um i did really enjoy the art show i mean i wasn't

536
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:28,000
 in the market for buying any art this year because art car i'd have to get the art ship thousands of

537
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,600
 hours from me which seemed impractical so i didn't really notice the lack of linkage between art show

538
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:39,600
 and being able to buy the art but i i really enjoyed the way you could just kind of go to an artist's

539
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,320
 site and just you know enjoy clicking through and have a sort of guided tour of all their art

540
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:50,640
 and i did enjoy that um yeah for Alex Stora who designed the gatherer and also had an exhibit in

541
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,800
 the art show he does a lot of music and so you can just play the music and there's absolutely no

542
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,560
 problem with that and imagine trying to do that in a regular easter con art show it you know you'd

543
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,520
 have to have like three people sharing pairs of headphones whatever it would just be terrible

544
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,160
 whereas in the virtual one it's like yeah you want to show videos you want to have music go for it

545
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,960
 so that was really nice

546
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:16,240
 i think it's the alice it's the alice and segment of the podcast i think now

547
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:22,880
 i want to talk a bit a little bit about how to cherry stecons but i did that actually i've i've

548
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,200
 it turns out from a few weeks before the convention we were talking here about it in octa thought but

549
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,560
 because i do a lot of different things in fandom and therefore i i get involved in lots of different

550
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:40,240
 areas of convention i kept asking different areas of conventions about things that included things

551
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,280
 where i was working on the convention and i needed support from the convention to do what i wanted

552
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:52,320
 to do and didn't want to be interfered with um and also areas where i was bringing things to the

553
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,720
 convention and so wanted some information about how the bits of the convention i was bringing things

554
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,320
 to would work and areas where i had information for them and i was like do you want to do some of

555
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:08,240
 this stuff on your social media and what what i was finding was that there's a lot of work in

556
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,080
 an easter come particularly in the last four or five weeks and what i was finding was that

557
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:19,200
 every single decision no matter how tiny had to be made at committee level and that doesn't mean

558
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,440
 that a committee member made the decision what you would get is you'd be in conversation with committee

559
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,520
 members and they'd be going i cannot make that decision it has to be made in full committee

560
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:36,160
 we didn't have a bid for 2023 but it wasn't really a terrible problem if we didn't because

561
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,080
 it's only 2021 now so we could bid next year but then about three days before three or four days

562
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,960
 before the easter con somebody asked if anyone knew anything about a 2023 bid and Vanessa said

563
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:54,560
 yes and i formed a think and my think was i don't think Vanessa should get another

564
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:01,440
 turn at this just because um just because she wants it because she hasn't had a chance to

565
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,840
 chair a physical convention yet i i'm not totally reversed for Vanessa running the easter con in

566
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,400
 2023 but i thought she should take to where to have a little think about it and so i started

567
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,720
 sounding out other people um about their experiences of working on this convention about their

568
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:24,640
 experiences of working with Vanessa and um and i started thinking about the possibility that we

569
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:30,320
 might need to say at the bidding session oh you know what you should take some time to reflect and so

570
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:36,320
 i asked i think two days before the convention how you'd go about um expressing the fact that you

571
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,880
 wanted to speak at the bidding session and i didn't get an answer and other people started asking on

572
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,720
 by behalf whether this was going to get answered i didn't put them up to it they just kind of asked

573
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,840
 and that we didn't get an answer and then during the convention obviously they were too busy on

574
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,520
 Thursday and Friday but by Saturday they were i was kind of going how are we going to speak at the

575
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,920
 bidding session they were kind of like an eventually we found out that it was going to be a secure

576
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:04,800
 zoom where you could type in a 160 character um comments and i felt well actually that's not the

577
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,880
 way our community works and and that caused me to coalesce around the notion that i really need

578
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,440
 to speak up and say something on behalf of all the people who weren't getting to speak and when i

579
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,520
 asked the convention if i they could make provision for me to speak they said no you can only speak

580
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:25,680
 if you're a bid and this at that point i thought that was just plain wrong so i wrote a speech and

581
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:32,160
 i bid for 2023 and the speech is on answerable so you could go and read it because that seemed like

582
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:37,520
 um nailing it to the church door of fandom was the comment that somebody else used about their

583
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:44,000
 rant which is not like my rant but it was it's a speech about what you should do if you're

584
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 chair and obviously i was coming at it from the point of view of it felt to me like i was not seeing

585
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,280
 evidence that vinescent was doing enough of these things but it's a general speech about what i think

586
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,320
 a convention church do and i think it's pretty good which is why i've left it lying around despite

587
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,920
 the fact that it has had its purpose which was to push the east to come bid off for another year

588
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,920
 um i feel like a lot of things that i felt didn't go well about this convention were down to not

589
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:15,040
 doing the things i talked about in that speech and a lot of this podcast has also been um it was very

590
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:21,200
 uncomfortable to do that because i felt like i was standing up and plunging all fandom into war

591
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:28,960
 she was um my friends have been very kind but i'm sure my enemies are not being very kind so if this

592
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,560
 is you i all i really wanted to achieve was to just put off that decision and i think

593
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:39,440
 so i just want to jump in here and tell you what your speech was in the true manner of a white

594
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:48,720
 vanish male go on i need a mansplain oh it was more in my opinion it was more than you just explaining

595
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,600
 why the bid needed to be pushed back it was a neat summarization of all the reasons that people

596
00:56:53,600 --> 00:57:00,720
 had been disgruntled with this east con in the last year in a easy to understand package which

597
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,920
 made people think oh like from from my perspective anyway i had been feeling frustrated annoyed and

598
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,200
 disenfranchised by this east con but i i don't think i could have put quite my finger on why and i think

599
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,160
 if you listen to the last ooh 26 episodes of octa thought you can probably hear that although i talk

600
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,920
 about it a lot i'm not sure i'm particularly good at saying it's these five things that they're not

601
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:26,160
 doing and when i watched you give that speech it just all clicked and i'll say yes that's exactly why

602
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,280
 that's why i feel dissatisfied that's why i feel disenfranchised and that's what i want the east

603
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,520
 con to be and so i think it wasn't just a speech delivered to explain why the bid needed to be

604
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:45,760
 pushed back to 2022 but it was also a statement of i would say that it would be a very good foundational

605
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,480
 document for what it is we hope to achieve as a community and that's why i think the analogy of

606
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,000
 nailing it to the church door is so apt because i think it is the sort of document that deserves

607
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,480
 to be nailed to the church door of fandom and so i i do think in fact you are selling yourself

608
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,640
 slightly short because i think it was a very good encapsulation of a lot of things i feel about east

609
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:14,400
 con as i said my friends supporters would be very kind to me okay so i mean i i'm sure that there

610
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:21,680
 are people who don't feel that way i if you think at this point i am a quite grumpy person who was

611
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:28,320
 just being grumpy and and Vanessa absolutely deserves another shot right now without a period

612
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:34,480
 of reflection then why don't you in the after times by me a drink and i'll tell you why you're wrong

613
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:43,600
 the other thing is although i am sure and i think this comes down to um whenever you get people

614
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:50,960
 who are disagreeing with you i think it is very difficult for anyone not i'm not i'm so i'm going

615
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,880
 to say me personally if i say something and someone i know says no you are wrong and i am annoyed and

616
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,120
 here are the reasons i think you're wrong it is often very difficult for me to tell whether i am

617
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,520
 at the edge of the bell curve and i am very unusual in thinking what i think and they are very typical

618
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:11,760
 and thinking what they think or the reverse and i think that's true in any disagreement you don't know

619
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:19,280
 how widely felt um either viewpoint is and i think so when we were criticizing east con in the run up

620
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,400
 you could plausibly have said that the loudest voices in the chorus of people criticizing east con

621
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,760
 were people who are us or people who are friends with us and so i think if you are running east con

622
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,000
 you could quite plausibly have said well yes but this is just ten people with like a stick up their

623
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,040
 ass so we probably don't need to treat their opinions as representative i think what the bid

624
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:46,640
 session showed quite neatly because 16% of people voted for Vanessa in 2023 10% of people voted for

625
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:53,280
 you in 2023 and 69% of people voted to hold over and i think what that shows quite neatly is that

626
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,600
 it isn't a case that it's 10 or 15 people who are very loud in east con fandom who had these

627
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,200
 reservations but it is a large segment of fandom who felt this disenfranchisement and i think if

628
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,920
 that wasn't the case then 2023 would be settled now and and your um and people would not have voted

629
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,360
 to hold over the vote until next year so i think the fact that people did vote for that means that

630
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,480
 although i'm sure that like there is a component here of your friends are being very kind to you

631
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,400
 and your enemies are probably not i do think that indicates that on some level a large segment of

632
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:31,040
 of the people in that meeting did sympathize more with the way you framed that and i i do think it

633
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:38,160
 is important that we don't be too um self-effacing about that because i think it's an important point

634
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,920
 which is it's not that you made a speech and everyone just ignored you you made a speech that resonated

635
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:50,000
 i did pull some skills that i gained in my previous professional job to do that um that have been

636
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,680
 lying dormant waiting for a suitable outlet for quite a long time um so you know that was quite nice um

637
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:04,800
 i think i was i am serious i mean i joked about i'll tell you what i'm wrong but i am very up for if

638
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:11,680
 you're listening to this you're thinking allison is full of beans i am full of beans and also yeah

639
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:18,800
 i am very very happy to to have a chat i think what i will say is that was probably one of the

640
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:24,240
 strange easter-comped sessions i've been to um not that i've been to that many used to

641
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:30,960
 combin sessions but it was unexpected and that's it i think like it's not something i would encourage

642
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,080
 people to to do at bid sessions is to to stand up and bid in order that they can kind of pin their

643
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:42,080
 personal philosophy of easter-con to a church door but you were left with no other way to do that

644
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,400
 because of the way they'd done it and i think that you know if i think there were lots of ways

645
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,320
 they could have headed off you ending up at the point where you felt you had to actually bid for

646
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:56,720
 an easter-con and pledged to be run more than necessary in order to make your point and i think

647
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:02,160
 that maybe just comes across again the the fact that everything seemed to be quite tightly controlled

648
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:07,680
 and communications quite tightly controlled and part of that was obviously not really wanting the

649
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,760
 bid session to turn into lots of random chatter and try and keep everything neat and tidy and

650
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:18,080
 and questioned through one channel where there was like a character restriction um and so yeah you

651
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,800
 ended up basically standing up and pronouncing with philosophy of the easter-con and i was a bit

652
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:28,080
 tense because i was like i don't know because in a normal bid session i could gauge the audience

653
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,920
 and i can see who's there and and who do i know and who are these people and do they seem to be

654
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,960
 like yeah yeah going along with it or are they like what is this woman doing once you just get

655
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,360
 off the stage so we can vote and you don't have that feeling in a virtual one and so when it came

656
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:46,080
 down to like actually okay 70 70 percent of people have said yeah let's hold it over think about this

657
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:51,920
 and come back next year and and really bid in it i was like phew because that made me feel like the

658
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:58,000
 community is supporting Alice in statement which i also very much support and i think

659
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:03,600
 sorry Alice i'm just going to tell you more about how you did um i think but i think what Liz just

660
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:09,920
 said there what Liz just said there is is also i think something she said much better than me but

661
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,000
 which i also felt which is and i think it comes back to that thing of like these two uncommitted

662
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,600
 didn't know whether it was just ten people who were very loud or whether it was widely felt thing

663
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,280
 and i think this is something we've had for the last year which is we're not seeing each other in

664
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,400
 pubs so we can't gauge the mood in order for you to make your feelings known about this you have to

665
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,360
 deliberately write it down in a place where people can see it you can't just nod along to a pub

666
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:37,600
 meeting or or something like that and so i think i think this is actually a problem of lockdown

667
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:43,360
 generally and i think in some ways because i was very tense in that meeting as well i was by no

668
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,200
 mean sure that you were going to come out of that meeting with the desired effect and the fact that

669
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:54,800
 it was like 70 percent of people voted um hold over was a was a very big relief to me um and so i do

670
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,440
 want to echo what Liz said which is i was glad that we had that opportunity to take the temperature

671
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,000
 of the room in lockdown because i think it is very difficult to take temperatures of rooms virtually

672
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,560
 yeah and also it was the first contested bid in my time in fandom this is my 14th east common

673
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,560
 it was the first time there's been a contested bid in all that time so it was exciting so it was

674
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:21,120
 not my first contested bid and my first east con was a contested bid it is true that contested bid

675
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:28,960
 in the year 2000 BC when dinosaurs roamed the earth pretty much but in fact dinosaurs ran the

676
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,560
 east con which was why we had a contested bid which we won um anyway sorry that that line probably

677
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:42,320
 used to cut out because those dinosaurs are mostly my friends now keeping it in keeping it in i don't

678
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:47,200
 think it's fine but i mean you know it says the thing which is that the reason you have contested

679
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,720
 bids is not because two groups of people want to own the east con it's because there are fundamental

680
01:04:52,720 --> 01:05:00,800
 differences of view about what the convention is and what it stands for i was not expecting

681
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:06,160
 not to prevail i was slightly worried that i would end up with the east con seated with me

682
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,280
 which i as you know didn't particularly want

683
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,520
 listeners if you have ever wondered what unbridled self-esteem looks like you can hear it here now

684
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,840
 but yeah no but i'm going to explain why which is that i had talked to a lot of people and i

685
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:27,760
 hadn't just talked to them i did a thing where i got talked people who i knew had the ear of people

686
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:35,760
 who are not particularly my friends in fandom but whose opinions i trust and i got those people to

687
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,760
 sound out the people who i'm on not such good terms with and in fact i in at least one case some of

688
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,080
 my mates came to me to tell me that they'd had a very worried conversation with one of the people

689
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:52,800
 who i don't it is not is not one of my intimates and um and so so this is just kind of how basic

690
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:58,800
 politics works and i am not actually a hugely political animal but um i did actually i had

691
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:04,400
 actually done my homework i would have been extremely surprised um if the east con if that

692
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,400
 meeting had gone the other way i wanted just tiny tiny moment on management and organizational

693
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,080
 design which is that i don't i think they need to do a lot of it because i think virtual

694
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:18,560
 eastercalls are very different which conventions are very difficult and i'm not sure they really did

695
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:25,920
 any of it so we ended up with teams that reflect the teams you have at

696
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:32,640
 physical eastercalls and i think they kind of got in each other's way quite a bit and that that is

697
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:38,080
 i think absolutely down to chairmanship as well and finally a lot of this a lot of what's

698
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:46,000
 is said was focused on Vanessa but that was because Vanessa had just bid for a convention for which

699
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,520
 she had no announced committee so she was literally standing up and saying let me have the easter

700
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:57,920
 con and i'll i'll run it my way and and i think that was that was quite easy to to counter

701
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,600
 in a way that if she'd had a good team around her i think i might i might very well have

702
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:09,760
 have not persuaded people to hold over i think a really useful skill in an easter con chair is

703
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,960
 being able to do this thing where you can go okay i'll go and ask this person because i know they

704
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,480
 can take the temperature of these other ten people who don't necessarily know me it wouldn't

705
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,360
 necessarily speak up directly to me and in that way you can get an overview of what people are

706
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:28,080
 thinking and that's actually really effective skill if you're going to run an easter con so

707
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:34,080
 as Liz mentions alison is very good at working with and talking with members of the community

708
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:39,200
 in order to build up a view of what needs doing who needs to do it and when and it is for this

709
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,880
 kind of tireless invisible behind the scenes service that she has won the doc weir reward so

710
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:53,840
 congratulations alison very well done um yeah no i was very pleased to win the doc weir um

711
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:02,560
 thanks to my octaphor co-host because i think i kind of got it not for nailing things to church

712
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:08,480
 doors but because i've done a load of stuff for the last year about keeping fandom connected in the

713
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,640
 keeping uk fandom connected in the pandemic and i think that octaphor has been a big part of that

714
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:18,160
 and i am also i think there might have been the ones that put the fix in don't know what you mean

715
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:25,120
 i am very pleased to have won an award for for massive humility and i am intending to

716
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,560
 play on this every time i feel like i want to say in my humble opinion i know that i am in fact

717
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,960
 expressing a humble opinion because i just want to make a humility award so there we go

718
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:41,920
 the reason i vote for you and all weir was mostly not because of your um nailing things to church

719
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:47,200
 doors but mostly because i think you have done more than anyone else in the last year to keep

720
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:54,080
 British fandom a community and i think that deserved recognition and that is exactly why i voted and

721
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:00,080
 i think i as a lot of people also voted before you nailed things for church door um which makes

722
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,240
 it somewhat awkward because i don't think you should win for laying things in church door that's a big

723
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,840
 obvious visible thing i think you should win for the fact that you have basically been keeping a lot

724
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:14,560
 of people going socially and you know keeping their mental health uh good free ear basically

725
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,160
 i've been trying very trying

726
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:26,720
 oh the old jigsaw the best yeah you've had your head your moment of humility now let's go on it

727
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,800
 i have right yeah thanks a lot guys
