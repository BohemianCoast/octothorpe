00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
 Hello Oct though, listener, it's John here. Just a very quick note before you listen to the rest of this episode,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,280
 that in between recording and releasing this episode,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,560
 Discon 3 did in fact rename their promotions division, the communications division.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,960
 So, to whoever at Discon is listening to our podcast records, please stop, it's scary.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,960
 This is an aggression my grandparents life was ruled by food, so the half of the lunch dishes

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,600
 washed up. My grandmother would sit down with a cup of tea and two chocolate biscuits,

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,280
 and that will keep her going for the period between immediately after lunch and property with

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
 sandwiches and cakes and tea, which was at five o'clock. What I loved about that was this is deep

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,120
 and heartfelt sigh, which is why listeners, you heard me lose my **** halfway through Alisson's

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,120
 anecdote. It didn't go in the direction I was expected. I thought Alisson was going to send us

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,160
 into an argument about which meal times happen at which time of day, and we have neatly side

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:27,200
 step that and let us never go back. Hello everyone and welcome to the very 36th episode of the

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:35,280
 Octa Thought podcast, which is coming to you on the 22nd of July 2021. I am John Coxon.

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,240
 I am Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. God, it's only the 8th of July. Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,000
 Yeah, we are well in advance here. And we are recording early because it is the summer of fun,

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,120
 summer of fun, and at the time of recording it has been six hours, approximately, since we last

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,880
 released an episode of Octa Thought, and we have had two letters of comment. And this is mostly

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,400
 because I said things about cake, which is, I think, very good. Chris Garcia says, "Alice

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:19,680
 in is right, so very, very right." Right, anything else in the locks, guys? Alison, I think you might

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,320
 have done that thing where you read someone saying Alison is wrong, but you you fuzz it up in your

21
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:32,160
 head again. No, I am merely selectively quoting from Chris Garcia's lock. Chris agrees with me on cake,

22
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,280
 and well, no. Chris disagrees with Alison on cake, but agrees with Alison on Neil Gaiman,

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,160
 and also gets a plug for my fanzine lulzine in there, which I appreciated. Thank you, Chris.

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,480
 Chris also says that brownies are not cake. Brownies were cookies, and then they evolved into their

25
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,240
 own category. And the key thing about this is that brownies have never been cookies because,

26
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,840
 well, cookies is just the American name for biscuits, and as we know, don't write in,

27
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,920
 I mean, do write in, obviously, biscuits have a nice snap to them so that when you pick up a

28
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,600
 biscuit, it goes, snap. So this is, um, this is in fact wrong. You pick up a biscuit and it sort

29
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,440
 of crumbles apart, or it's very soggy because you had gravy on it, and Chris will know what I mean.

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,240
 No, no, those are American biscuits, which are scones. No, they're not. Basically baked goods are

31
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,200
 hard. No, no, if they're hard, you're doing it wrong. They should kind of be soft and fluffy.

32
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,440
 No, if they're hard, they're biscuits. We've been over this. No, no, no, biscuits are crispy,

33
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,000
 but they're not hard. They're just kind of yewy a ginger nut. Okay, ginger nuts will break your teeth.

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400
 I love ginger nuts. Liz, what's your favourite biscuit? What are they called? Those, uh,

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,800
 chocolate oleum nuts that are like a sort of rich tea underneath, but they got chocolate on top.

36
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,120
 They're even better if you just eat all the chocolate off the top and then throw the rest of it away.

37
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,240
 Well, the other option is, uh, Marks and Spencer's, uh, very chocolatey, uh, rounds.

38
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:14,000
 Which, as they say, are more chocolate than biscuit. Marks and Spencer's dark chocolate ginger

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,320
 biscuits, which remind me of my grandmother because she used to eat two of them every afternoon with her tea.

40
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,680
 Chris also says, "Let us all rejoice that a Merry Robinette Coel option for chairing has been

41
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,760
 activated." And, um, yes, this is something that happened after we recorded our last episode,

42
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,560
 and by the time you hear this, we'll be old at. Yeah, it happened about 20 minutes after we

43
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,520
 recorded our last episode, and I did tell John to record a pickup and slip it in, but he didn't.

44
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,400
 Nope, I didn't. He also has a question for all of the Oct thought people, which is what is the

45
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,880
 best way to get things to us. So, um, said it to me, Chris. I want it. Whatever it is, me.

46
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:04,560
 Email. I assume he means physical tat, but I could be wrong. And then, and Rosin wrote to us with a

47
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,480
 letter of comment, um, saying that she too did a slightly sad face when me and Liz spoke about

48
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,760
 reading Good Omens as teens. She would have been 19, but only started reading, uh,

49
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:22,400
 Toprech it the year. It was published so probably, uh, 21 before she read it. Um, so yes, and she

50
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,840
 agrees with us that John Finnenmore being involved is good. Uh, and she notes he is an excellent

51
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,240
 observer, and that is true. And I don't think we've mentioned it last episode, but his, his

52
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,320
 observational sketches are amazing. So, um, that is a very good point. Um, and she has joined

53
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,160
 Discon 3, and she blames us for this. Sorry, she has bought a virtual membership to Discon 3,

54
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,360
 and she blames us for this. She says that listening to Oct thought is an expensive pursuit. Uh, so,

55
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,480
 um, sorry about that, and, uh, not that sorry though. Hashtag sorry, no, sorry. Um, and then she

56
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,960
 tweeted ours to say forgot to mention in my lock, not all of those things called cake, a cake,

57
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,160
 see pancake. And that's a good point, pancakes, not cakes. They are, in fact, biscuits.

58
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,560
 No. So, and mentions that listening to Oct thought is an expensive pastime, and I think we can combine

59
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,120
 this with Chris Garcia's letter to say, if you would like to send us stuff, obviously get in touch.

60
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:30,160
 We are going to talk about something that we started to talk about last episode. We want to

61
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:39,360
 touch a little bit on how conventions communicate and, and how it might be quite rooted in quite

62
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,360
 old-fashioned assumptions about how communications actually work that haven't really been reconsidered

63
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,840
 in the modern age. A crude model of how world communications work is that the role of communicating

64
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,000
 with the outside world is taken by two of the world contributions, which are promotions and

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,680
 publications. And this is for good reasons. It's basically because in the old days, most of what

66
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,560
 happened in terms of kind of communicating with the outside world was done by writing things on

67
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,400
 bit of paper and sending them to people. The key issue here is that obviously the advent of the

68
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,360
 internet complicates this model, because it basically means that you have a lot of opportunities to

69
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,200
 talk to your membership. And there's a lot of opportunity for potential miscommunications if

70
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,800
 one division is communicating on the internet with the membership in a way that is not consistent

71
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,320
 with the kind of view of your world con as an entity. And so this is something that I think has

72
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,040
 gotten much more common is that now any division can directly interface with the members in a way

73
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,720
 that I don't think was anywhere near as possible before the internet was around. But what this means

74
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,360
 is that now, instead of having two divisions who are the public facing divisions and the rest kind

75
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,840
 of being either public facing but at con or being internal, you have divisions all of which are

76
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,200
 effectively public facing. But we haven't reconsidered how world cons communicate in light of that.

77
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,920
 I think that best solution to this is to have a communication division whose job it is to come

78
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,000
 up with the opinion of the world con on certain issues and to make sure that the world con actually

79
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,160
 hues to that line. And I don't mean this in terms of, and so I'm not talking a kind of draconian

80
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,560
 controlling the message thing, I'm more talking about a way of making sure that if you take a high

81
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,840
 level decision, the communications of your convention actually reflect that high level decision.

82
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,160
 What I more mean is if you've decided that it's important to consult Hugo finalists on things that

83
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,360
 affect Hugo finalists, you make sure that every division is aware that that is a decision the

84
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,000
 convention has taken and you provide support to divisions to enable them to do that well.

85
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,680
 I think the same thing is also true of East con but I think East cons have less rigid

86
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,560
 organizational structures which are more changeable between East cons. So I think it's less of a

87
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,080
 problem there. But one of the reasons I've volunteered to be the head of communications

88
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,680
 for the 2024 East con is because I do think some of these comments are applicable to East cons as

89
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,000
 well. Now Alison who has made a variety of faces through what I've just said will come in and

90
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,960
 disagree with everything and tell me why I am wrong. Liz might want to go first though.

91
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,560
 That's very nice of you. I mean I do think John is wrong in some ways. So

92
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,920
 John is wrong and then you can follow up with why John is more wrong. So I just say I haven't run

93
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,080
 a convention in the pre-internet era because you're going to go back to sort of the mid 90s I would

94
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,720
 guess before you go back to one which was not doing things on the internet. So I'm not sure if it's

95
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,000
 that more divisions are communicating as much as more divisions can communicate more and they

96
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,680
 look faster. The program division would always be communicating with program participants. It's

97
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,880
 just now instead of sending them a letter you have like a whole series of back and forth emails and

98
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,120
 an awful lot more communication going on. And the same thing with you know like member services will

99
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,360
 be communicating a lot more with people. Access for instance communicates with people an awful

100
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,040
 lot under an awful lot of like direct sort of member facing communications. So I don't think it's

101
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,840
 that it was all it all used to be confined to certain divisions but I think it's just that it

102
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,080
 all happens more and faster and in some case it happens in a much more public way.

103
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:31,440
 So but I also think some of this is you can't split communications into kind of public facing

104
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,320
 and sort of private communications. Oh you can. I don't think I know that you can because nothing

105
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,440
 you know because it gets out yes it does. Yeah I mean I'm thinking you shouldn't do that you

106
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,480
 shouldn't think of things as being private and public just because anything you say on behalf

107
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,960
 of the convention could be quoted somewhere or revealed even if you didn't intend it to but I

108
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,120
 think you can draw distinction between things which are official con communications happening

109
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,480
 on those channels and things which are essentially discussions happening in emails between

110
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,040
 warm member of convention staff and some of the members and things like that because those I think

111
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,760
 maybe don't need to be in such a strong branded voice as maybe your public facing communications do.

112
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,280
 I mean and it also depends I mean if it's something you're going to send to like a thousand of your

113
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,680
 members you probably do want to think about how it comes across whereas if this is you know someone

114
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,880
 sends you a you know a query about where's the nearest pharmacy to the convention center and you

115
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:35,040
 send something back that doesn't maybe need to be quite so strongly thought about. So I think

116
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,360
 John's wrong. No I think John is most right in some parts but also wrong in some other parts.

117
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,400
 That's what they said when I was born. He's right in some parts but wrong in others.

118
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,680
 Yeah it went wrong. So I think we touched on one of the part things that I think last week which is

119
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,040
 that the voice of the chair is very important in determining conventions overall tone and that

120
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:05,120
 is not cited in either publications or promotions division. I have a kind of general rant which is

121
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,800
 not really necessarily a rant for this particular discussion on the subject what are the publications

122
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,680
 of a convention for and if it's not for communicating your conventions philosophy or telling people

123
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,920
 information they need to know then then I'm kind of like well why why have them and that

124
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,280
 does flow through into things like if you choose to do special publications or something like that

125
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,320
 why are you choosing to do those particular special publications and I would include the

126
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,920
 program book or souvenir book within that because I think a lot of the stuff a lot of convention

127
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,240
 program books are very bad and a lot of the stuff that goes in them is of very poor quality this

128
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,480
 this kind of links to a lot of fanish fanishly produced material for a purpose

129
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,680
 to order is often quite bad and I think that that that just is an example of that.

130
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,520
 And John didn't really touch on on the social media specifically which is kind of an area

131
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,160
 ahead within promotions division most of the time but has which has two jobs for most conventions

132
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,760
 I think one of which is to again impart the conventions lines to take and philosophy to the

133
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,240
 membership but also it's got this reactive role of spotting not only when the internet has come

134
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,400
 down on your head and you need to deal with it but also the when bits of your convention are not

135
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,720
 worth working properly the way you find out about it first is through your social media team and if

136
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,440
 you're lucky it's in direct messages to the social media team where somebody says I've been trying

137
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,680
 to raise so and so in bug-f*** division and they haven't really got back to me for four months and

138
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,160
 is there a problem there but sometimes it's actually that that conversation is quite public

139
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,520
 which is why every every company on the internet is always busy going please please send us a DM

140
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,520
 so we can deal with this where people are watching and I think there's a whole thing there about the

141
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,760
 process by which we set up effective and rapid communications with members in a way that doesn't

142
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,800
 cause volunteers to get extremely tard and stressed out all of the time it's kind of so this is why I

143
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,480
 think both outreach and promotions are not a great name for that division and that is where John and

144
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,040
 I are in agreement because it's clearly a communications division and that bit I would agree with I think

145
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,400
 the role of promotions is increasing as the role of publications should be shrinking I tried to get

146
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,080
 rid of them for EasterCon I didn't try to get rid of all of them because we wanted to have some

147
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,600
 ACON publications that were good and I think we did but it isn't necessarily shrinking and I think

148
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,160
 we should be doing more to think about what it is that each publication achieves and what it does

149
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,320
 for members particularly if you're going to put that publication into the post because post

150
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,320
 global post is now very expensive I wanted to get rid of progress reports for

151
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:06,240
 follicom in 2018 because I thought they were very outdated and not a very good use of people's

152
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,560
 time but it turned out that Eastercons have a kind of flow and rhythm and there's an expectation that

153
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,400
 certain pieces of work will have been done by certain dates and those are the dates of the four

154
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,440
 progress reports so even if you don't have progress reports it's quite useful as a

155
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,880
 kind of planning structure for your convention to say we will announce the following things at the

156
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,400
 following times so even if you actually get rid of the physical progress reports you need to be

157
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,280
 quite careful that you don't get rid of the work that you should have done by Novocon or whatever

158
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,200
 and if you make your overarching communications division like with any other machinery of world

159
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:50,080
 conchangers as us all civil service lags would call it you have to be sure that the jobs you end up

160
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,120
 with are sensibly sized and that's something we touched on a little bit last time on progress

161
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,400
 reports I think I completely agree that I'm not sure of the merit of posting progress reports to

162
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,200
 members but it is definitely helpful to have those milestones and I think you're right that you have

163
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:12,000
 to think about what certain publications are doing so I think for instance I support having

164
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,520
 physical readmees physical newsletters at conventions and I quite like the artists showcase that world

165
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:27,600
 contents to do and the reason I like those publications is because I think they each occupy a they each

166
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,200
 fill a role at the convention which I think is not necessarily easily filled by other things and I

167
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,400
 am even though I am someone who is very technology forward I think being able to have a copy of the

168
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,960
 program that doesn't run out of batteries is useful being able to have newsletters that you can wave

169
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,280
 people or put in places where people notice them as they're walking rather than having them on a

170
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,640
 website that people might not check is useful and having the artists showcases a way to kind of

171
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,960
 give people a tangible reminder of the artists that were your convention and a way to connect

172
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,920
 with the artwork after they've gone home I think is useful so I do I'm not saying that there shouldn't

173
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,400
 be a role for paper publications but I do think you do have to think quite carefully about what the

174
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,000
 what the things you want to do with those are and why you're doing them and if the answer is because

175
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,880
 we always do it that you might want to have another thing and it might well be that you come up with

176
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,000
 reasons you're like oh actually no this does still make sense like physical newsletters and I agree

177
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,880
 with you as well I think you are right that effectively what's happening is the promotions or the outreach

178
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,960
 division is the communications division but I think that's one of the reasons why I want it to be

179
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,080
 renamed because I want it to be I think there's a tendency for Worldcon not to consider the role

180
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,640
 that that division has in shaping the message and the personality of the Worldcon and I think

181
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,400
 giving it a different name and perhaps refocusing kind of some of what it does would be very helpful

182
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,560
 in that regard to make it clearer that they do have that role instead of calling your promotions

183
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,480
 division say promotions division or outreach division you could just call it the Worldcon fire

184
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:13,120
 service yeah I think that works also unrelated I have a art request that's just come to my mind

185
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:22,240
 for some reason if you try to control the message too much you are probably doomed but there is a

186
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,480
 happy medium and there are certainly things about which the convention should say this is what we've

187
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,680
 decided and this is what therefore everybody in a senior role on this convention is gonna say about

188
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,200
 it and I don't think it's wrong to have that expectation but I think at the point where you're

189
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,480
 going oh we require everyone down to the person who is stuffing um flyers into combags has to have

190
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,960
 exactly the same line on everything the convention is doing I don't think that's necessarily the case

191
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,600
 but I think it's reasonable to say you'll be generally positive and here are some topics that

192
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,200
 we have some standard things that we say about them and we'd like you to say those standard things

193
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,000
 yeah I think it can be standard things but it can also be like in a fast-moving situation where

194
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,720
 you know things could go in multiple directions like for instance a thing you know with the Hugo

195
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,560
 finalists where things are obviously moving very fast and they could have resolved in multiple

196
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,160
 different ways I don't think it would be helpful if you ended up with conflicting messages from

197
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,920
 different senior members of staff on that one or even kind of senior members of staff just like

198
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,640
 disagreeing with each other you're better off kind of you know deciding who is going to take

199
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,800
 the lead on communications for the convention for that and backing them up on it.

200
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:37,920
 I help reminding people that they don't necessarily need to weigh in all of the time on every

201
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,040
 argument on the internet that concerns the convention that they're working on especially

202
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,400
 arguments that are about live issues that don't have resolution yet is not a bad thing to do

203
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,240
 which is the thing that I joked last time about Glasgow doing but you know it is sensible.

204
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,360
 I was going to ask did has at the time of recording has Meg listened to episode 35 yet that's the

205
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,880
 question. It doesn't seem very likely does it because it's been like six hours you should either be

206
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,040
 doing practical things that people need to know or things that support your overarching

207
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:23,280
 convention philosophy. So for example for Follycon producing work by I guess Savannah was supporting

208
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,640
 the overall sense of what it was that we wanted to do with the convention and for a world con you

209
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,880
 might say well producing the art show is is producing the art showcases is expressing our philosophy

210
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,520
 about what the art show should be like at this convention but but all too often you kind of get

211
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,760
 a thing where you go well here we have a a chunky souvenir book what does it have in it oh let's

212
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,560
 look at what last years had it. I'm much more going let's what what is the positive what are the

213
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,160
 positive things you're going to try and achieve with this. Yeah so I think that's interesting

214
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,880
 because I've been wondering if whether there's also another sort of role now for social media in that

215
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,480
 this was some some discussions I was having with friends about non-convention things but just about

216
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,680
 like how you try and grow your social media presence and how you try and attract more people to your

217
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,720
 social media which is like an increasingly important tool for bringing people to your convention

218
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,880
 and sometimes it seems like the strategies for growing your social media presence are not always

219
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,840
 going to be completely aligned with keeping your communications just to kind of you know things

220
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,680
 that are practically important about the convention or sort of things that relates to philosophy of

221
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,680
 the convention. So I think you do need to balance how you can have a sort of engaging social media

222
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,480
 presence that actually draws people in and also hopefully posts on a regular basis and is there

223
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,120
 to answer people's questions and tell them practical information but also to try and do a bit sort of

224
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,080
 outreach just through social media and I know personally I'm not very good at doing social media

225
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,640
 for conventions because I'm not very good at getting that balance between you know posting

226
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,880
 regularly and posting interesting stuff without kind of just posting things for the sake of it that

227
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,160
 are maybe not that related to your convention or its philosophy you're just sort of randomly

228
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,600
 posting things on the subject of science fiction fandom for the sake of like trying to pull in

229
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,760
 more science fiction fans and I think that's quite a tricky balance to make and I wonder if there are

230
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,560
 you know I wonder if there are social media experts that we should be talking to you more about how

231
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,960
 we run our social media effectively or trying to get on board on board with us just because I think

232
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,760
 some conventions are not regulated and also like there are more and new forms of social media that

233
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,000
 we're not really using like I felt I don't think I've seen many conventions with sort of Instagram

234
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,680
 or TikTok presences it's all kind of still Facebook and Twitter and I think I would just say I echo

235
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,440
 all of the things you've just said about what you find challenging with with kind of doing

236
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,960
 timely social media so I think that is a good point Glasgow does indeed its Disability Pride Month

237
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,080
 that posted two hours ago on Instagram so Glasgow very much has their social media strategy is we

238
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,360
 will be wherever we will have a social media presence wherever we think that the fans are that

239
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,400
 would be would enjoy our convention so they for example have social media presence on Ravelry

240
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:18,400
 which is the knitting social network oh that's clever and and also in fanzines because that's

241
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,560
 where I think that is just me so I'm not sure if that really counts um I hesitate to say well

242
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,800
 we should get people who are professional experts in this in because that's the sort of people who

243
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:37,040
 are professional experts in particular roles aren't always the very best people to run those

244
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,920
 things for a world con yes we need to be in more places but that doesn't necessarily mean that

245
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,320
 Eastercods suddenly need to have a big top presence yeah I maybe don't mean TikTok but I

246
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,840
 may also just be a sign that I am old now and don't know what the good social media platforms are

247
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,000
 I thought your point on the the giant logistics document was interesting though because another

248
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,080
 aspect of convention publications is making sure they do like move with the times and I'm sure

249
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,480
 there's lots of stuff we used to put in convention publications like exact details of how you get

250
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,400
 to the hotel that you don't need to anymore often still very useful yeah it's not so very useful

251
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,840
 but in a way it's like are you putting in here stuff which is already out there do you maybe just

252
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,520
 need like one copy of this at the convention info desk rather than posting it to a thousand people

253
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,440
 or similar I mean not not directions hotel yes I guess that is useful because people need to get

254
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,880
 to the hotel um but I think restaurant guides have moved from being you know here are all the

255
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,480
 restaurants around to more of a sort of like here is how you can pick a restaurant that is going

256
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,360
 to suit you and your your party because of you know different accessibility needs or different

257
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,160
 dietary requirements rather than you know because people can look in certain ways just like look up

258
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,640
 more easily how to get to places they need a slightly different set of information and

259
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,160
 want to make your publications change with what people actually need yeah you don't want to abandon

260
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,520
 everyone who doesn't have ready access to a smartphone but you can consider that a lot of your convention

261
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,960
 that does well and restaurant guides is a really interesting one because I think the merit in a

262
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:16,720
 restaurant guide now is much more tapping into local knowledge than it is giving a kind of dispassionate

263
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,920
 summary of what's about because you can get the dispassionate summary from TripAdvisor or Google

264
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,840
 Maps wherever you prefer to get your information but if you've got someone who lives in the area

265
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,320
 who loves eating out they're going to have the information like don't go on a Tuesday it's the

266
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,080
 wrong chef you won't enjoy it or if you go on this day like the queues will be awful going this day

267
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,320
 it'll be much better or what that that kind of personal information is really useful and something

268
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:49,200
 that's really difficult to get by just searching but the opening hours you don't that is not useful

269
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,760
 because it's it's trivially available yeah I think I'm near near a list that in fact it's the things

270
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,440
 like accessibility and dietary requirements which the formal restaurant guides on the internet are

271
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,840
 still very poor at often whereas fans definitely need that that's true a lot of convention social

272
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:18,560
 media presences are still quite bad it's this thing that Liz mentioned about talking about stuff that's

273
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:24,800
 kind of random science fiction stuff without it anyway relating it back to the site or the

274
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:31,040
 convention or the people who are likely to be there or or the memberships I mean I kind of I guess

275
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,680
 I think of conventions as being a little bit like a fancy that there are a community of people or

276
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,640
 a podcast there are a community of people and what you're actually trying to do is find stuff that's

277
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,440
 going to be of interest to that community and tell them about that and get and get some engagement

278
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,160
 going about that because otherwise the only things on your social media sites will be everybody

279
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,040
 whining at you but yeah I think actually the thing is that generating the content for social

280
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,680
 media is really hard work and I'm going to bring up Glasgow again as example of you know how for

281
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,400
 Pride Month Glasgow had a whole series of posts ready and things to discuss and things that they

282
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,480
 could put on their social media feeds so they weren't really you know tweeting happy Pride Month

283
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,680
 here's some rainbows it was actual interesting content of interest to their members and Glasgow

284
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:20,800
 specific but that takes an awful lot of preparation and work and you know cohesive communications

285
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,080
 strategy and I see too many things that kind of don't do that and just post happy May the Force

286
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,480
 be with you today and this is actually a really good point because it kind of gets to something

287
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,240
 that Alison was saying earlier where you know there are two schools of thought with the publications

288
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,240
 you make you either think well what did the Worldcon do last year or you think about what it is you're

289
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,760
 trying to put out into the world and you reflect that but the problem with social media is that if

290
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,880
 you take the kind of we'll just do enough that people know we're here you end up with that kind of

291
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,160
 just tweeting every two weeks saying happy happy Pride Month happy Star Wars day whatever and you're

292
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:03,200
 not that would be better than the average um convention social media strategy but it I will say

293
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,680
 that I think doing what Liz is describing and what Glasgow is doing where you are having that kind

294
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:16,080
 of um sustained program of interesting content is is probably more work than the traditional um

295
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,680
 than than assembling the content used to be for the traditional suite of of publications because

296
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,240
 you've got vastly more content you need to put out now and so it is I think a real it's a really

297
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,560
 difficult thing and Glasgow are making it look very easy so well done to Glasgow Glasgow working

298
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:41,280
 very very hard Esther said at conspire that the things that they were doing in terms of running

299
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:48,160
 panels at conventions and having a lot of blog posts on their social media site and in general

300
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:55,200
 being extremely engaged in all the ways they can be for a bid are kind of what they're doing because

301
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,560
 they can't be in all your regional conventions running parties because those those conventions

302
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,640
 aren't happening they are running virtual parties as well but they're not you know they're not

303
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:12,160
 serving whiskey to the denizens of Chicago or whatever and um and I feel like that's that's

304
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,960
 they've actually directed bid energy they've actually thought quite seriously about well where

305
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,360
 can we direct our bid energy if it's not into running parties at regional conventions it's going

306
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,320
 to be really interesting to assess how well that works because first I'm interested in in how it

307
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,320
 works if you have a communication strategy that relies less on going out and and meeting people

308
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,920
 the more on doing it or online but also I think it's a really hard thing to assess because how

309
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,240
 well do you how do you judge how well your social media is working do you judge it purely on the

310
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,320
 number of people who are joining your bid and you know giving you money I mean that's one way to do

311
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,920
 it but also it's clearly like raising awareness and maybe getting you into you know corners of fandom

312
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,920
 that you wouldn't otherwise be in or you know getting people engaged from different groups and I'd be

313
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,000
 really interested to know if any conventions have tried to kind of assess how their different outreach

314
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,200
 methods are working you know can you use like you know different different URLs in different

315
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,880
 places to see if you can work out where the referrals are coming from and that kind of thing

316
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:18,560
 John tell me about analytics so um I think this is a really interesting point which I think

317
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:25,200
 I think you can do that it is not clear to me how much of that you can do for free

318
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,360
 yeah you can do little bits of it for free but the question about whether you really want to

319
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:39,760
 um yeah I'm not sure how many people either Eastercons or Worldcons are attracting especially

320
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,120
 at the bid stage who are not already known to the community through much more traditional

321
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,840
 outreach methods like we know those people I just wanted to come back to something that Alison

322
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,960
 said earlier about how she was worried she might be repeating herself the other key thing about

323
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,920
 Confu-convention communications is you need to repeat yourself because people especially on

324
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:08,560
 on on social media where the things you see are not controlled by are you looking at the right

325
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,280
 time but are controlled by kind of what does the algorithm decide to show you it's vitally

326
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,440
 important that you tweet things multiple times in different formats if they're vital information

327
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,040
 because if you don't people might miss them uh and so you can't assume that if you tweet something

328
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,000
 once everyone who you need to read it will read it and that's another really important thing

329
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,520
 this is why it's important that everything that people actually need to know is also on your

330
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,000
 website in a way that they can find um yeah because literally every piece of information that people

331
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,480
 are likely to go looking for needs to be you need to be have either have it there or tell people

332
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,560
 how they can get it or when they're going to get it and did we do anything of these things for

333
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,080
 punctuation not really but it was fun anyway and we're going to do another oh no that's secret

334
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,840
 no we did we did it eventually make sure we put the program on the website it did take us a while

335
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,400
 one of the things i find very frustrating about conventions is when they put a piece of

336
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,520
 per- a piece of information in one place rather than putting it in many places because that's the

337
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,080
 other key and the thing and so there has been examples of conventions in the distant past and in

338
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,000
 the more recent past which which have kind of said oh well it's on our facebook and it's like that's

339
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,600
 not helpful because i mostly check your website your mailing list and discord so if you've just

340
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,920
 put it on your facebook i have missed it despite the fact of following in three different places

341
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,840
 and the thing we did do i think quite well for punctuation is that when we wanted to tell

342
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,840
 people something it was on our website it was in our emails and it was on our discord and it was on

343
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,440
 our social media now i don't think we did a great job of continually pushing those things and i

344
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,440
 think we probably could do that better next time but i was there i think punctuation two

345
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,680
 much better job than punctuation one where we were like everything's on the discord why is no one

346
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,520
 checking uh and something that we did iterate quite quickly for punctuation two to make that better

347
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,600
 and so it is one of those things that if you don't think about it it's very easy to fall into that

348
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,480
 trap but um put everything you want people to know in as many places they will read it as possible

349
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,640
 we did forget to put the punctuation two program on the website for quite a long time though until i

350
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
 told people it was on the website and then had to go john put the program on the website

351
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,400
 look right we're clever listeners so there's room for improvement

352
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:27,120
 but also if you think that we are holding world cons to a higher standard than easter cons which

353
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:34,000
 we're holding to a higher standard than the convention we've run in six weeks flat for a bunch of mates

354
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,640
 then you are not wrong i think i gave john my air table for folicon and suggested he might like it

355
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:47,200
 for 2024 and i feel like if you don't have a grid system for your communications as if you

356
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,120
 were like number ten or something you do need one even if you're quite small certainly regionals need

357
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,160
 one you need you have to have a calendar and know when your big messages are coming and know

358
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,320
 when you've got fallow periods and you're going to have to have the summer of fun or something to

359
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,760
 to find things to tell people because there's nothing going on and and you need to have that

360
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,200
 stuff quite early and in quite a boring way and although john says make sure that everything is

361
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,160
 everywhere you need you often need to have the same message in multiple different formats and you

362
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:25,280
 need to you need to have art and and pictures that you could use to go with your messages and

363
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,880
 you need to know places that you could get them and all of this stuff is a lot of quite i mean it's

364
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,120
 not really like professional social media work i mean it is like professional social media work

365
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:41,840
 but it's like the most boring and basic type of it but you kind of need to do that stuff and

366
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:48,800
 if you are just still at the phase of oh this has happened we should tweet something you probably

367
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,880
 should take a step back from that and i think a lot of conventions are still doing social media in a

368
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:02,400
 very seat of the pants sort of way that's not necessarily helpful

369
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,320
 did i say last time that having a Hugo division that both administered the

370
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,600
 Hugo's and ran the Hugo like ceremony was probably a bad idea yeah oh well i won't do that again

371
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,760
 then although if you did i have a new thing which might be good which is that Nicholas

372
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,280
 Nicholas White wrote a thing about the Hugo's and what he's voting for in best related work

373
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,160
 and one of the things he sort of buried as a nugget in that bit was his emotional reaction to

374
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,600
 watching the Hugo ceremony at Conzeland because he felt quite strongly that the Hugo ceremony at

375
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,600
 Conzeland did not reflect what he was trying to achieve as the administrator of the Hugo's and i

376
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:49,280
 thought that was quite an interesting example of an area in which a failure to have a clear

377
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:57,760
 convention line on what something was had basically meant that the eventual public facing

378
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:05,920
 Hugo's from Conzeland were something that the Hugo administrator was sad about

379
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,320
 i think i think the things the set of things that went wrong with Conzeland's Hugo ceremony

380
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:21,680
 um it's quite big and a lot of it's related to failing to cope with the pandemic and therefore

381
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,240
 failing to keep George under control which they might not have been able to do anyway but certainly

382
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,800
 couldn't under the circumstances and yeah but i think i think that happens maybe to a lesser

383
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,920
 extent across the whole of the convention like it's perfectly possible to put together a great

384
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,440
 program and then find that the advertising of it by you know the promotions or communications

385
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,120
 division is kind of really disappointing and in direly not focusing on what you want them to

386
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,960
 or to put on a set of really great events and find that you know the

387
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,560
 publications vision managed to not list them in the right way in the program like i think there's

388
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,960
 lots of ways divisions interact where basically you can cause there's a point with to one division

389
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,360
 because of what the other one does but i don't think that's an argument for kind of reforming

390
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,920
 them in different ways i think actually what you're arguing for is better communication between

391
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,360
 divisions rather than reforming them in a different way yeah i think so i mean essentially what you're

392
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,280
 saying is that you have to take this set of division heads who are and possibly deputy division heads

393
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,440
 who are very global come come up the world come from very different perspectives often have very

394
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,080
 little in common and sometimes actively hate each other and form them into a cohesive team despite

395
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,560
 the fact that everyone's working on a voluntary basis and it's all a big set of baronies so

396
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:46,320
 um yeah quite hard i mean it's it's not trivial but i mean you just get done better at some

397
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,200
 conventions than others no one and i will just say i think i think you and lissey both right i think

398
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,320
 that is the answer but i just um i thought it was worth bringing up just because i think it

399
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,880
 it kind of got a little bit while i was trying to get to that last week but i do agree with both of

400
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:08,560
 you i mean there is something here too about the actual job of chairing a worldcon which is

401
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,440
 sufficiently in order to get it you have to kind of you have to be very single-minded about it in

402
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,200
 a way that is not necessarily doesn't necessarily require the same skill sets as the building a

403
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:29,600
 cohesive happy team skill set and at least in at least a couple of cases i've watched as conventions

404
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,320
 kind of jockeyed around who would end up with the chairmanship of the convention and have not

405
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,480
 ended up with the person that i would have thought would be the best at pulling the team together

406
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,360
 and and i think that's the sort of thing that does play out down the line yeah i i think that

407
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,960
 goes with the very when we were talking about conventions which have a very strong chair's voice

408
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,880
 versus of the don't sometimes having a very strong chair's voice kind of just sets the tone for the

409
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,760
 whole thing and so when you are if you have the kind of the chair in place when you are recruiting

410
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,560
 the division heads then they kind of know what they're what they're getting into you know they sort

411
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,920
 of know what the tone of the convention is going to be and i think you can also mitigate this because

412
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,000
 you know which divisions are going to have to work more closely with each other and which ones are

413
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,120
 going to be at kind of more arms length and so you try and make sure that the division heads and

414
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,920
 divisions that are going to work really closely with each other are you know more on the scale of

415
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,720
 working well together rather than the hating each other side of things you know you know like

416
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,120
 programming events are going to work very closely together i think you know that sort of facilities

417
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,880
 and member services are going to work very closely together and that kind of thing i and by the

418
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,440
 same tone it's clear that wuss was division is often quite detached partly because of the hugo far

419
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,440
 wall but in general is often quite detached from some of the other areas of convention and that

420
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,880
 is an issue for things like the hugo ceremony where obviously they should be working very closely

421
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,200
 and tandem with events i mean wuss was basically kind of rins almost three separate things that

422
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,520
 don't actually go very closely together because it runs the hugos it runs site selection it runs

423
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,640
 the wuss was business meeting and those three things just kind of go together because they're

424
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,520
 the things you sort of have to run because wuss was exists but they don't actually sit together

425
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,760
 that neatly oh they sit together neatly and that they're the precise set of things that the world

426
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:26,880
 can't be required to do so um alie baker who is um someone who will be well known to

427
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,880
 east con fans uh she has run programs at east conlan is running the program with vajena

428
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:41,280
 preston at the 2022 east con uh has started a new podcast it's called the fantasy book swap and the

429
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,360
 basic um concept for the podcast is that a guest picks a favorite fantasy book from their childhood

430
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,520
 alie picks a complimenting contemporary book and they talk about them the first episode is a

431
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,520
 dela terelle and alie talking about the magic far away tree and the dragon in the library by

432
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:07,280
 louis stowell and they will be recording that um in between now and when this episode comes out

433
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,600
 and there will be a link in the show notes i think this is a really cool idea and i'm pretty sure

434
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:18,880
 alison is excited too yeah so so i i the magic far away tree was my favorite book in the whole world

435
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:28,240
 when john was minus 15 years old or something like that i don't know the magic far away tree is the

436
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:36,080
 first book i remember reading i have a lot of of fondness for that yeah i mean it's it's it was

437
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:42,000
 my first not necessarily my first chapter book and certainly not my first book because i i read

438
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,280
 a lot of very short books but but certainly the first book that i kind of had that reading

439
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,680
 experience fanish reading experience of reading the same thing over and over again and go this is

440
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:59,040
 this is amazing i should i want to read this all of the time um i i grew out of that phase

441
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,120
 the last time i finished a book of wet i must start this again from the beginning um it was

442
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,960
 wolf hall and it's sequels by hillary mantel and i got over it pretty quickly because it's like

443
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,680
 a hundred and an eighteen hundred pages long anyway um so i have read the dragon in the library

444
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,960
 and i really didn't like it very much at all and i haven't reread um the magic far away tree but i

445
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,720
 suspect i wouldn't like that very much at all either and i think this is because i'm not eight

446
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:35,040
 what i think both of these books are really aimed at people who are quite a bit younger than me

447
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,800
 now but i do have lots of interesting thoughts about the dragon in the library so i'm going to

448
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,920
 pre-lock alleys podcast and i think if you also have a lot of interesting thoughts about these

449
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,400
 books you should pre-lock it as well so she can start the podcast with a load of a load of letters

450
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,040
 that say this is a this is more an opinion than a question and i think you are right i don't know

451
00:42:53,040 --> 00:43:01,120
 um i have not read uh the dragon in the library and and i i'm probably not going to because i'm still

452
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,720
 chewing my way through the hugo voter packet um thank you very much allison i am also chewing my

453
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:13,200
 way through the hugo voter packet um i think i've read about eight percent of shawnan maguire's series

454
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,000
 uh so you know there's work to be done i am super excited to listen to the podcast i think it's a

455
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,360
 really good idea for a podcast it plays to alleys strengths both in genre and in her academic expertise

456
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:29,360
 really well and i think it's really cool that we're getting more podcasts coming out of the british um

457
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:35,120
 science fiction fandom uh and i think that is just that can only be a good thing so um well done alleys

458
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,560
 and i look forward to hearing episode one and i really love the way that it's speaking directly

459
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,880
 to this way that people have fond memories of the books that they've read in childhood and so

460
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,200
 believe that they are much better than they were in fact and are in fact and and hopefully that's

461
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,960
 something that will come out i i have suggested a book which i still think is quite good that is one

462
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,360
 of my favorite books for childhood so hopefully i'll be a future guest on this show and i did not

463
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:07,840
 suggest but somebody else might like to i did not suggest journey to jupiter by a few vultures but

464
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,720
 i didn't think about it quite hard which would have been which is possibly a book that was even

465
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,280
 more influential on me than than um the book i have picked oh is this is this is finally the

466
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,480
 all going to be on a future episode i'm hoping to be on a future episode yeah i i i i i i saw i

467
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,480
 nabbed the book so so she has somebody else talking about that book i'm going to be very

468
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,840
 sulky what book did you pick alison i'm not going to say because you know i want it to be a surprise

469
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,160
 when the podcast comes out but i mean anyone who knows me and knows the books that i cite as

470
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,520
 influence such a children's books would probably have a good guess um somebody else in that thread

471
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,320
 grabbed carton quidder which is another book that i might well have chosen but i didn't read it when

472
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,080
 i was a child so i don't think it would count this is one i did read as a child because it was a

473
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:58,960
 television series when i was a child i think i have not i have not asked alie whether i could be or

474
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,320
 no or not uh i don't know if i will but if i did ask or if he invited me the book i would pick would

475
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:12,320
 be rebekah's world by terry nation which is a phenomenal children's book as the only children's

476
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:18,160
 book terry nation wrote and it is the same terry nation from the dalex and it is about a world in which

477
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,480
 ghosts are repelled by wood and that's why there are no ghosts and we don't realize that until we've

478
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,800
 chopped all the forests down and replaced them with gleaming skyscrapers and modernity and it is

479
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,440
 i i just loved it when i was a kid um i thought it'd brilliant i have no idea how it holds up i have

480
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,120
 no idea what alie would say about it um but but yeah it's my kind of i have always loved that book

481
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,840
 it's a great choice liz what would you pick if you went on the podcast i don't know i'm thinking

482
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,840
 about this now i think the problem is i was probably reading books that were age group inappropriate

483
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,040
 when i was uh you know too young for them and so i'm now trying to think of what fantasy books i

484
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:05,280
 read that might have been like actually age appropriate rather than an macafrey which was not uh and

485
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,640
 very much not i mean maybe i will um who i think it was uh false meadows who read a bunch of early

486
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,840
 and macafrey and just highlighted all the immensely terrible stuff in them oh some of which i picked

487
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:25,200
 up on even even at the time so you can tell how kind of egregious it must have been um that's

488
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,240
 made me it's maybe a digression but i'm trying to think i'm trying to think of what i would have

489
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,800
 read i must have read stuff i mean i read i read like every book in the library so this is probably

490
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,720
 the problem is i read so many books as a child it was basically whatever was in the library and

491
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,000
 nothing has stood out as i read it 27 times apart from i read a lot of books about girls going to

492
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,960
 ballet school or going to boarding school or boarding ballet school or that kind of thing

493
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,720
 did you read any about girls going to magical boarding ballet schools

494
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,400
 no i don't think i did that's the thing they're all going to sensible boarding schools and except

495
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,480
 for one who gets like consumption and then has to go to a special boarding school i feel like this

496
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,880
 is not this is not john's reading experience if nothing else we're learning we're learning a lot

497
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:12,400
 about formative liz which i thoroughly enjoy there's a there's a there's a group on facebook

498
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:20,720
 called finishing school which is a a group of people who chat about um all fashioned all

499
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,880
 fashioned children's books so so things like angela gets it off and you know

500
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:37,600
 she'll enjoy her pody's oh i will no i i actually know i know what it would be now

501
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,880
 i think what it would be is actually i started reading all these point torah and point fantasy

502
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,800
 books that are you know probably when i was at primary school so actually yes

503
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:55,040
 they'd be a great choice it's a lot of terrible books about like american high school kids getting

504
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,480
 murdered on on demonic roller coasters and things excellent well there's our children's book so i

505
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,080
 think that's a good i think that would be good great choice yeah yeah definitely oh jesus so jon

506
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:13,520
 do you want to know how much the audiobook of rebekah's world by terry nation narrated by paul

507
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:22,640
 darrow will set you back on amazon i don't know but you should do it 894 pounds jesus

508
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,800
 i mean not these are what we're saying here is that rebekah's world is a rare book at this point

509
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:36,960
 that was the octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

512
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,640
 it is a very nice garden i don't think it's the nicest garden in the world but it is lovely

513
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,440
 some very nice garden she was like i'm in captivity she showed us this photograph of

514
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,640
 a beautiful garden do you bet john said i was in captivity and i said you were in captivity

515
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,560
