00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
 Hello everyone, it's John here just recording a quick pre episode pickup with some details

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,560
 of things that we mentioned in the episode.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,120
 So firstly, the Chengdu website is back up.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,040
 That won't make any sense to you now, but it will do at about 12 minutes in.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:24,000
 Secondly, we mention the launch of all these worlds reviews and essays by Neil Harrison

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,520
 at Eastcom, but we don't mention it is on this Saturday afternoon.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,440
 So do keep an eye out for that on the programme.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,240
 And thirdly, we mention that we'll be recording at Eastcom but we don't tell you when and

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,240
 that is going to be at 1.30 in the afternoon on Monday.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,240
 Yeah, it will be a kind of wrap up of what's happened during the con.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,440
 Alright, now into the episode.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,880
 In the last couple of weeks, the world's first Octopus farm has opened.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,560
 So if you haven't already stopped eating Octopus, guys, you need to stop now.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,120
 Or if you do carry on eating Octopus, make sure it's wild caught Octopus and not farmed

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,960
 Octopus because seriously, Octopus is intelligent.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,560
 They may be as intelligent as us.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,800
 We should not be farming them.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
 Oh my goodness.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:15,120
 My wife and I do not eat Octopus because although many meats, we draw the line at intelligent

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,200
 creatures, it's also why we don't eat chat GBT.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,520
 Although that's mostly because although it isn't intelligent, it is very crunchy.

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,000
 Oh, that's so they can.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,040
 Liz, completely unmoved by that listeners, Alison, shortly away without making a sound.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,560
 This is a good sometimes where jokes land very much with one co-host and not the other.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,960
 I'm not sure it landed exactly.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,680
 I was just like, oh God.

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,080
 It's more of a John's Attie to get in, isn't it?

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
 Yes.

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,480
 John's gone off on a joke thread.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,480
 That was, it was that sort of a shuttle.

31
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,240
 We were promised jet lagged.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,440
 I'm not sure this is noticeably jet lagged.

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,080
 I actually, I am jet lagged.

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,720
 The reason you can tell this is because I've only just worked out that when I adjusted the

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,880
 gain on my mic to make it good for podcasting, because the last thing I did before leaving

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,120
 for work was podcast, the game was all right and I adjusted it to not all right and I've

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,960
 just adjusted it back again.

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,000
 So this will go at the front of the episode to be like, there's not much evidence of jet

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,600
 lagging here, but the sound quality on my track might be one of them.

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
 Don't know yet.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,840
 I haven't listened back.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:34,280
 So apologies listeners, if I screwed that up.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,080
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 80th episode of OctaThorp, the podcast for science

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,960
 fiction and science fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 30th of March, 2023.

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,520
 I'm John Coxon.

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
 I'm Alison Scott.

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,160
 And I'm Liz Batty.

48
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,400
 And today we have some letters of comment for you all.

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,840
 First up we have a letter of comment from Mark Plummer and we got Mark curious about

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,040
 word counts for the same text in different languages.

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,240
 So he says the top ranked German language book on Project Gutenberg is the critique of

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,480
 pure reason by Emmanuelle Kant.

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,640
 And if you strip out all of the front matter and Gutenberg boilerplate, it's about 176,000

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,040
 words and the English language version is about 198.

55
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,800
 It is the Michael John translation, which is a detail he only mentions for obscure fan

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 historical purposes.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,320
 At the Harrogate Mexican, the Friends of Foundation had a copy of the can on our table, of course,

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,960
 alongside the G-Paton, Wharton, Bakers and Festus, Pregnals and so on.

59
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,600
 And I think it was Michael Abbott who noted in the newsletter that it was the Michael

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
 John translation.

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,080
 Sadly, I can't recall whether or not he thought that was a good thing.

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,640
 He can also report that all of the world is about 60,000 words, but La Gird de Mons is

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,200
 about 64,000 words.

64
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,040
 And the Gods of Mars by Edgar Rice Bros is about 83,000 words in English, but only about

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,560
 57,000 words in Finnish.

66
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,920
 So thank you very much, Mark.

67
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
 Some case studies.

68
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,080
 Yeah, there is some weird stuff going on there in Finnish, isn't there?

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,200
 It's interesting as well because Mark points out that the text in English is 360,000 characters

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,280
 but in Finnish it's 400,000 characters.

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,680
 So yeah, it's interesting that it's so many fewer words, but those words are much longer.

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,160
 We didn't hear from Nicholas White, but we did read his Facebook.

73
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,160
 Yes, so I think two weeks ago I was saying I was quite confident that nothing in a foreign

74
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,480
 language had ever been nominated for a fiction Hugo in a foreign language.

75
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,600
 And obviously because I was quite confident about this, I was probably wrong.

76
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,040
 But credit to me, I did spot this on Nicholas's Facebook myself.

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,400
 He didn't write into, to let me know I was wrong.

78
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,760
 And that is because the little prince was a finest for the retro Hugo in 2019.

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,200
 And it's not clear whether that would have been, you know, was it the French original

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,960
 was nominated or the English translation?

81
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,400
 And even if one was actually eligible for the retro Hugo, it wasn't translated until later,

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,120
 I'm guessing a lot of the nominators had read it in English.

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,040
 Unfortunately, it was not a problem because with the wiggle room for novella, you could

84
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,560
 fit them both into the novella category, basically.

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,000
 So it wasn't a problem, but that is, yeah, I think one edge case where it has come up.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 But I guess that's going to occur more regularly in the retro's where if something got translated

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,200
 10 years later, it might already be, you know, it might be widely known even if the one that

88
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,480
 could be nominated was the original.

89
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
 So there we go.

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,880
 I was wrong, but I think that's the only edge case.

91
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,240
 And it is the retro's that don't pay any attention to the retro's.

92
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
 So that's my excuse.

93
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,320
 And that's why Liz's rocket's always crash because she doesn't pay attention to the

94
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
 retro's.

95
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
 Yeah, I got it.

96
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,000
 I mean, I will say everything enough attention is paid in the community to how great a like

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
 name the retro Hugo's is.

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,280
 Like, even if you don't like the idea of go back and filling in the old, like the naming

99
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,960
 on point on the subject of the retro he goes, it does occur to me that there should be a

100
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,000
 conversion factors for how books were shorter in the old days.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,040
 We should have book inflation.

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,680
 We should write this into the Wussfuss Constitution.

103
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,200
 If anyone wants to co-sponsor, let me know and I will propose it to us first.

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,880
 I think I think the Wussfuss constitution should have way more trivial amendments taking up

105
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,040
 time at the business meeting.

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,280
 I think that's what we'll need.

107
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
 That's exactly what I'm at the business meeting for.

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,480
 I mean, to be fair, if there is going to be, okay, let me be afraid.

109
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,160
 Then there is a lot of completely pointless trivia at the business meeting.

110
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,960
 It would be at least better if it were funny.

111
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,560
 Ian Hillman writes in to say that George Takaie collaborated on a graphic novel called

112
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,160
 "They Called Us Enemy" that is also based around the experience of Japanese Americans

113
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
 in internment camps.

114
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,560
 And he says that his understanding is that it was more critically well received than

115
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
 the musical.

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,080
 So if anyone is interested in that story but not interested in the musical, then we recommend

117
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
 you go.

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
 Well, Ian recommends you go look that up.

119
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,000
 Thank you very much, Ian.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,400
 And after our call for arachnophobes to tell us if they had read works of Adrian Tchaikovsky,

121
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,040
 we got a letter from Gwen to inform us that she read "Children of Time" knowing those

122
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,600
 spiders and was pleasantly surprised at how much they liked it.

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
 So big thumbs up.

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
 Excellent.

125
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
 Thank you, Gwen.

126
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,200
 I said that she read it.

127
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,920
 She speed read the human chapter so that she could get to the spider chapters fast.

128
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:35,160
 I think I read "A Deepness in the Sky" by reading the human chapters as fast as possible

129
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,640
 so that I could get to the spider chapter.

130
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,520
 So maybe this is a thing.

131
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,200
 I mean, the spider chapters are vastly better, I think, in "A Deepness in the Sky."

132
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,600
 Yeah, I think that's right.

133
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,120
 So maybe there's just something that's excellent about spider chapters.

134
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
 Right.

135
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,080
 I think the human chapters are good as well in "Children of Time."

136
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,680
 It's just that if you can read about people or a novel spider people, then you read about

137
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,880
 the novel spider people, right?

138
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,360
 This is how we know you're a science fiction fan.

139
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,400
 And yeah, if you liked the chapters with the spider people in "Children of Time," then

140
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,600
 just wait for this equal when there's other stuff.

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,120
 I have finished reading "Children of Ruin," and there were some people who told me it was

142
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,760
 about octopuses and they were correct, but there is other stuff happening as well, which

143
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
 was very creepy.

144
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,360
 I liked the book a lot, but yeah, no, yeah, it was good.

145
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,680
 It might be a spoiler.

146
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,760
 No, I mean that.

147
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,640
 I mean, no, I mean, and it is fantastic.

148
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,480
 I didn't know that I liked spiders until I read that book, and I don't like spiders,

149
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
 but yeah.

150
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:46,560
 We got a letter of comment from a publisher, so we got a letter of comment, or more accurately,

151
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,760
 a press release from Brian Dean Books to tell us that all these worlds, reviews and

152
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,200
 essays by Neil Harrison will be launching at Estercon.

153
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,960
 So we will perhaps have that as a pick when it's out and one of us has read it.

154
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,200
 Spoilers listeners, I have already got a copy, but I have not finished.

155
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,080
 I'm only about a quarter of the way through, but it is very good and I will pick it eventually.

156
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,240
 And finally, we heard a lot about loss isspooky's.

157
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,040
 So there was at least one person who didn't get the name from the audio, so it's loss isspooky's.

158
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,080
 Regis, that person was me.

159
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,840
 You didn't stop me to query.

160
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,480
 You just let me carry on with no idea what I was talking about.

161
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,640
 Yeah, I think you said it was on Hulu, so I was like, oh, well, I won't be seeing that

162
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
 for a while.

163
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
 No, HBO, wrong one.

164
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
 HBO.

165
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,680
 In the UK it's on now.

166
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,880
 Yeah, so won't be seeing that for a while.

167
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 But it's very good.

168
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,320
 It wasn't until I went to look at the Wikipedia article that I realized that it has 100% fresh

169
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,040
 on Ron's tomatoes.

170
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,160
 So that is quite a high, quite a high reading.

171
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,560
 But Karen Shafer wrote in to say that she had watched it on our recommendation and was

172
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,040
 thoroughly enjoying it.

173
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,520
 So I am very glad and very glad that that landed for someone.

174
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
 Great stuff.

175
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,640
 Oh, and we also heard from a member of the Hugo Girl podcast.

176
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,280
 We heard from two different members.

177
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,720
 So firstly, we heard from Amy, who says that I'm right about Spock and Muck being great,

178
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,760
 I assume, and not the pronunciation.

179
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,640
 You're definitely wrong about the pronunciation.

180
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,200
 We also heard from Laurie, who said, "Here's a fun Instagram she just noticed.

181
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,400
 OctaThorpcast is an Instagram of OctaThorpcast, and we shall have a spin-off show."

182
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,320
 And I am down.

183
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,720
 I will record my cats and put it up as bonus episode one day.

184
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,480
 Large-tooted to us about episode 79, confirming that he is not a teenage girl.

185
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,760
 He is a middle-aged Indian man who lives in Glasgow, even though there are some who would

186
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,520
 argue that his tastes haven't grown beyond those of a teenager.

187
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,400
 He disagrees with me strongly about children of time and says it's very much a book about

188
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
 spiders.

189
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,000
 I didn't think I had said it wasn't about spiders, but I agree with Rod, it's definitely

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,520
 about spiders.

191
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,840
 I should listen back to the episode and see what I said.

192
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,160
 Listeners, write in and tell me what I said.

193
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,520
 And he also asks about the satellite 8 COVID policy.

194
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,720
 So he said, "It looks fine to Raj, but then Raj thought that one about the Easter cold

195
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,960
 one too before Liz and I talked about it."

196
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,480
 So yeah, fair enough.

197
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,480
 No, so the satellite 8 COVID policy is a lot terse, and is, yeah, it seems good.

198
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,320
 It's, it's seven, well, it's two bullet points with seven sub bullet points, and they're

199
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
 all good bullet points, Brent.

200
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
 So I like it.

201
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,200
 I don't know if you've looked at it Liz, but...

202
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,640
 I have not, but I do like bullet points.

203
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
 Exclusive thing, Imajig.

204
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,960
 Yeah, it's not really an exclusive reveal that I like bullet points.

205
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,640
 Anyone who has said anything I've ever written would be able to confirm that one.

206
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,360
 Bullet points are great, is why.

207
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 Yeah.

208
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:06,720
 Chengdu.

209
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,800
 In the regular, there's not much in the regular Chengdu is a shower segment, except that Chengdu

210
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,080
 sent everyone an email saying that they would be a shower imminently.

211
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,520
 Well, it just kind of said they did.

212
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,080
 Or are currently a shower, but imminently won't be.

213
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,320
 They just said they take their website down for maintenance, which is fine, and they told

214
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,520
 us they'd let us know again when it's up again.

215
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,960
 So as long as it comes up fairly quickly, I think that's fine.

216
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
 Yes.

217
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:39,720
 And then I was quite snarky about the lack of English in this email, and I was called out

218
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,840
 for my angler privilege, which is perfectly fair.

219
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,640
 Yeah, I mean, I'm of the opinion that it was clear to me from the email what was going

220
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,960
 on, which is the website was going down for maintenance, be back later.

221
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
 And if currently down.

222
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,560
 Basically, if your English is not perfect, but I can get the gist, I don't care.

223
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,960
 Is my philosophy on these things.

224
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,720
 My philosophy, I think, is I hope is nuanced, which is...

225
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,560
 That'll be a first.

226
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
 Oh, oi.

227
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,560
 John's full of nuance.

228
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,920
 I mean, I wouldn't go that far.

229
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,720
 I'd say I'm half full.

230
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,080
 Oh, look at me being nuanced about my nuance.

231
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
 Wurp.

232
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,160
 It's like nuances, seption.

233
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,920
 My perspective is basically if I hadn't talked to at least a few people who had attempted

234
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,800
 to volunteer for Chengdu and who are native English speakers and who had been resolutely

235
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,000
 ignored by Chengdu's voluntary team, I would be more sympathetic.

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,640
 But I think there is it.

237
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,920
 I can see if it's like a small company who don't have native English speakers, I'm completely

238
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,400
 fine with them, not quite getting the English right, but I do wonder whether Chengdu could

239
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,880
 have solved this by having a better onboarding process for English speaking volunteers.

240
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,000
 So like, I think Liz is right, but I also think Alison is right.

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,320
 Is that a good episode title?

242
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,200
 We might have even used that one before, to be honest.

243
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
 I think that's fair.

244
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,720
 But I mean, I also think if what you're having a problem with is having enough native English

245
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,960
 speakers, then you may have a problem finding someone to do that onboarding for them.

246
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
 That is true, actually.

247
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
 That's a good point.

248
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,440
 But again, we really don't know anything about how the Chengdu-Wulcan is running.

249
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,880
 So kind of, it's such a mystery to us that we've had a regular, it's such a mystery that

250
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,560
 we've got a regular podcast segment on it.

251
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,240
 But I really don't know what's going on with internal communications.

252
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,680
 I mean, some things obviously are done by Lingley.

253
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,480
 I suspect this was just, "Oh, we better tell everyone the websites down," then they don't

254
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,200
 worry, and they wanted to get it out as quickly as possible.

255
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,800
 Yeah, no, I think that's fair.

256
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:47,160
 Let's do picks.

257
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,560
 Liz, do you want to go first because you've just written something in the show document

258
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,960
 and I haven't yet?

259
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,880
 Yeah, I might just have been putting my picks into the show notes as we speak.

260
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,440
 And again, I'm going to pick what may not be like the best thing I have read, watch,

261
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,000
 listen to, et cetera, but maybe the most interesting one to our listeners that we used to talk

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 about.

263
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,040
 And that is a 2022 novel by Gabrielle Zevin called Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow,

264
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,400
 which has been getting a lot of attention in mainstream circles.

265
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,560
 It's not because it's not science fictional, but it is basically about the friendship of

266
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,480
 two people as they develop video games.

267
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,600
 So it's about these two, Sadie and Sam, who meet as children, and they end up developing

268
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,920
 video games together.

269
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,680
 They make some very successful video games together.

270
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,160
 They have a video games company, you know, life strikes them, tragedy strikes them, things

271
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
 continue.

272
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,000
 And I thought it was pretty interesting.

273
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,240
 For me, it has some excellent chapters.

274
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,880
 Like there's one where it's all told through a kind of game, which is sort of almost across

275
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,560
 between Stardew Valley and the Oregon Trail, which kind of is revealing stuff about the

276
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,520
 characters as we go along.

277
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,760
 It's kind of there's some real video games in there as well, and there's also ones that

278
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,240
 are obviously inspirations to them.

279
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,040
 But all the video games they have worked on are fictional and it's about kind of the

280
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,720
 tension between art and making money and about how two people can both make art the

281
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
 satisfied them.

282
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,120
 I mean, in a way it reminded me of Mythic Quest, because I watched Mythic Quest season three

283
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
 as well.

284
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,280
 And obviously the heart of Mythic Quest is the, you know, Poppy and Iron, and like the

285
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,360
 ideas versus the programmer and how you kind of both be satisfied in that.

286
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,640
 But yeah, I don't know if I would ultimately recommend it.

287
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,360
 I think the ending is a little bit weak.

288
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
 It's maybe a little bit long.

289
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,920
 And I think it maybe feels like, you know, this discussion of people making like a novel

290
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,480
 about people who make video games does not feel to me to be like quite as much as a

291
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,480
 revelatory thing as I suspect some of the mainstream reviews have thought about it.

292
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,280
 But I did, I did enjoy it.

293
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,440
 And some of the kind of listening to the process of how they come up with these games and kind

294
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,760
 of technology moves on and the games become more technologically progressed and, you know,

295
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,680
 some of them are familiar to you from other, you know, you can kind of see how they would

296
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,200
 fit into our world of video games, which is interesting.

297
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,480
 So I think it's got enough in there to recommend them.

298
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,960
 I'm not sure I would say it is the best book of the year, but it is a pretty interesting

299
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
 one.

300
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
 Nice.

301
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
 I've heard about it.

302
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
 I haven't read it, but I've like, I've seen buzz.

303
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,440
 It's like Amazon's best book of 2022 or something like that.

304
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,120
 And, you know, it's been immediately the option for film.

305
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:30,520
 And I thought it was fun, but maybe doesn't quite stick it.

306
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,800
 And some of the characters feel a little bit, I don't know, they're not ciphers, but some

307
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,600
 of the characters feel a little bit underdeveloped.

308
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,960
 There's one particular character who doesn't really have many flaws.

309
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,440
 I mean, seems a little bit too perfect.

310
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,000
 And it's very fun to spend time with, but maybe doesn't quite work.

311
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,160
 But yes, it's in the top books of the year.

312
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,680
 And I have only read, I've read two actually of Amazon's, three of Amazon's top 10 books

313
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,520
 of the year.

314
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,520
 And yeah, it's hard to rank them because it's got fiction and nonfiction in there.

315
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,840
 But I wouldn't have said it was number one.

316
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,040
 So I was listening to Liz's pick going, this sounds just like Mythic Quest.

317
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,040
 So she said it was just like Mythic Quest.

318
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,160
 I mean, in the time since we last recorded, I've listened, I've watched quite a bit more

319
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
 of Mythic Quest.

320
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,080
 And I've actually got to the flashback episode in season three, which is called Sarion, and

321
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,960
 which I absolutely adored.

322
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,840
 So I thought that was amazing and a really great payoff for a lot of the things being

323
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
 seeing a Mythic Quest.

324
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,200
 Plus I still haven't quite got to the end, so there's a little bit more yet.

325
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,120
 And I don't know if there's going to be any more of it or not.

326
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,800
 It feels like they're wrapping up their story.

327
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,400
 That wasn't a pick, that was just kind of a reaction to Liz's pick.

328
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,560
 The reason I didn't pick Mythic Quest season three, I think I have picked season one or

329
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,920
 maybe particular episodes previously, is that it feels like the thing I like in Mythic

330
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,960
 Quest is so much Poppy and Iron.

331
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,480
 And the things I dislike about Mythic Quest are rapidly becoming basically everyone else

332
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,040
 in Mythic Quest who is not Poppy and Iron.

333
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,200
 Because I just feel like the other characters are kind of not really going anywhere or in

334
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
 some cases going around in circles or in some cases going somewhere but I don't really

335
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
 care.

336
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,920
 And they, like the fact that you can take a character like Iron and make him kind of,

337
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,680
 make him at times a terrible, terrible person, but also for most of the time not to make him

338
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,560
 relatable and interesting and someone I want to see on screen, I think is a great achievement.

339
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,480
 I love, I love Rachel and Jo.

340
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,520
 And Rachel I think it's going to be very interesting.

341
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,720
 I think her arc in season three is very interesting and I'm really interested to see what they

342
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,120
 do with Rachel and Dana in season four.

343
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,000
 When they renewed it, they renewed it for season three and four so we do know in fact

344
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
 that season three is not the last series.

345
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,600
 Yes, and that's not a spoiler because we did already know it, although we may have forgotten.

346
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,080
 And I did pick Mythic Quest season three, episode one as a pick a few weeks ago.

347
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,440
 So that's another reason why I probably shouldn't pick it again for a while.

348
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,960
 I also love Carol and I love how she's been ratcheted up.

349
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,760
 I've basically I love all of them.

350
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,000
 Yeah, now I disagree with Liz.

351
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,880
 I guess is the point I'm making slowly but surely.

352
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,960
 Yeah, that's the problem.

353
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,320
 You're like, I really love what the other Rachel and Jo and I'm like, I would be fine

354
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,320
 if we excised all scenes with Rachel and Jo from the show.

355
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,160
 Sorry.

356
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,560
 No.

357
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
 I love Dana.

358
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,640
 And it's fair to say that I really loved Sarion, which just has Poppy and I am.

359
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,880
 Oh no, he's Sarion.

360
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,960
 Sarion is amazing.

361
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,080
 All of the flashback episodes have been amazing.

362
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,120
 It was weird to see Sam Whitworth and Robert Piccardo pop up in Sarion.

363
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,600
 So I was like, they're famous.

364
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
 Are they?

365
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
 Who are they?

366
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
 Come on.

367
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,280
 I just assume I have no cultural reference for the last 30 years.

368
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,800
 Yeah, I had children.

369
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,040
 Oh, come on, Alison.

370
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,840
 Joe, Joe Man-Jennello coming up as the actor they want to play.

371
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,680
 The masked man was, I loved those episodes so much.

372
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:02,200
 And I loved David and Jo and Jo, like, I loved all of that plotline, especially because

373
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,640
 I've just seen Magic Mike.

374
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,720
 So, and also, if you don't know this, Joe Man-Jennello goes to every red carpet event

375
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,360
 with his tiny little dog and it's very adorable.

376
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,960
 So yeah, I just basically just want to be friends with Joe Man-Jennello.

377
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,840
 I mean, you know that Joe Man-Jennello famously has a D&D game?

378
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
 Yes.

379
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,200
 No, he's clearly a massive nerd.

380
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,240
 Yeah, he's supposed to go a D&D game with, like, Tom Morello and DBYs.

381
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,880
 They're a big nerd.

382
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,600
 I'm going to pick peer pressure.

383
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,000
 You're told at school peer pressure is bad, but peer pressure is great.

384
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,440
 I'm picking it.

385
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,040
 You could in some ways say that peer pressure is good because due to the peer pressure of

386
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,760
 John Coxon and some other people who will remain nameless for this podcast, I have bought

387
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,720
 plane ticket to Birmingham.

388
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,360
 Hey!

389
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,600
 So when we record a Easter card, it will be the three of us.

390
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,480
 Holy, oh God!

391
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,480
 We thought it would be fun to tell Alice in live on the podcast and indeed it is.

392
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
 Look, you swear you guys.

393
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
 Oh God.

394
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
 You might have to be that.

395
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
 Oh my goodness, that's amazing.

396
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
 That's so good.

397
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
 Yes.

398
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,320
 And so you decided you'd tell me live while we were recording and that's why I'd be like,

399
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:22,800
 "Who's that stunt is going to be?

400
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 Who's that stunt is going to be?

401
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,160
 Should I flag a membership for this so that she can appear virtually from Tyler on the

402
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
 big screen?"

403
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
 Oh God, you guys.

404
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,640
 I did wonder if you were going to have to spill the beans at that point.

405
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 And then she was like, "Do you want a virtual membership?"

406
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
 And I was like, "No, which is technically correct.

407
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,520
 I do not want a virtual membership."

408
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,000
 Have you actually joined the convention?

409
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,600
 And it would have just spilled the beans because I see all the memberships coming across my

410
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,240
 transtom because I get copied in.

411
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
 Yeah, I thought it might so I didn't do it yet.

412
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,680
 Also, I was seeing if anyone had a membership that they might sell me for cheap fees, but

413
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
 I can't find anyone.

414
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,520
 And I can't leave until the podcast goes out.

415
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,080
 So it's a "sell me" membership so I am going to have to go and buy one full price.

416
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,160
 But I did think that might spill the beans if I joined so I deliberately didn't do it

417
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
 yet.

418
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,120
 Oh, that is lovely.

419
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
 Yeah.

420
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,480
 So it was partly, you know, I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to go."

421
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,200
 And then I talked to John and a few other people and they were like, "Wait.

422
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,040
 Nina's a guest of honor.

423
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,600
 Why are you not coming to Eastacom?"

424
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,560
 And I was a bit like, "Ooh, it's a long way."

425
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,040
 Because I'm a cheapskate.

426
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,600
 Yeah, that was basically, it was basically, I was being a cheapskate and it was a long

427
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
 way.

428
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,040
 And then I counted my holiday days and so on and was like, "Oh, actually I could do this

429
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
 and it would be fine."

430
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:43,040
 So I am.

431
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,080
 Where we tested the theory that 13 Brits, which was how many Brits in total were there this

432
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,280
 year, could drink the, drinks, midi-cons, famous, free beer, dry.

433
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,200
 And we did not manage it, but we came fairly close.

434
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,360
 So, yeah, now I strongly recommend coming out to Eastacom's support, Neil as guest of

435
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
 honor.

436
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,240
 Let's leave it up and see if that's great.

437
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
 What else should also come to Eastacom?

438
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,440
 If you haven't booked your flight to Birmingham yet, it's time.

439
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
 I thought I might get the train.

440
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,560
 And also, or join us virtually, because there's going to be tons and tons and tons of virtual

441
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
 stuff.

442
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,320
 It'll be great, probably.

443
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,280
 So that is half of my pick.

444
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,720
 I will also pick a thing.

445
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,200
 You get to pick a natural thing, although I thought that would be quite funny.

446
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,360
 Yes, no, no, completely worth it.

447
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,440
 Oh, you got it.

448
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
 So...

449
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,960
 I was going to, I'm not going to pick a was as guy to defensive breaking because I picked

450
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,800
 it at episode 31, which I found out all on my own because I'm great.

451
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,640
 Ah, editors privilege.

452
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,840
 But the thing I am going to pick is Digger.

453
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:59,960
 So Digger is a comic about a wombat and Digger won the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Novel in

454
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,600
 2011 or 2012, I forget which.

455
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,600
 But it was in, the entire thing was in the voter packet that year.

456
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,040
 So if you download Hugo Voter Packets and you are usually a member of the Worldcon, then

457
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,880
 you may already have Digger on your hard drive.

458
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,840
 And it was 2012.

459
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:30,320
 But there was a Kickstarter for a new version of Digger, which was, which involved Pat Rothfuss.

460
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:38,760
 He launched a new publishing imprint because he wanted Digger to be back available again.

461
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,280
 And so I don't know when that version will be available for people to buy.

462
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,920
 But if you don't have it, a reprint is coming soon.

463
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,080
 And yeah, it's about a wombat and it's very good and it's very funny and it's very well

464
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,520
 drawn and it's just lovely.

465
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,120
 So highly recommend seeking out Digger if you have not already read it.

466
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,920
 And then it's Alison's pick.

467
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,760
 So I have had the huge luck to be able to read it over the last couple of days, an advanced

468
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,000
 reading copy of something very exciting indeed.

469
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,920
 So you guys can't see it yet, but you'll be able to see it by the time this episode drops

470
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,520
 I very much hope.

471
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,360
 And that is the programme for EasterCon.

472
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,120
 Hey!

473
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,200
 Which is fantastic and is full of excellent things, including OptiThought Live, which

474
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,520
 as we now know, well actually depends if John's doing some editing, is going to feature all

475
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,640
 all three of us live in Birmingham.

476
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
 Do we have any beer guys?

477
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,040
 I have quite a lot of beer.

478
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
 Right now.

479
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,400
 No, I meant special beer for OptiThought Live.

480
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,080
 Oh, special, special beers for giving each other the COVID, you mean?

481
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,080
 Yeah, none of us gave any of each other COVID.

482
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,360
 No, that's the episode title.

483
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,440
 And we're all very excited about the programme.

484
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,640
 I'm on some programme items.

485
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,240
 So I think the programme items I'm on are all the kind of things the committee are on,

486
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,560
 and then, which is the opening of Slosie Ceremonies, and then OptiThought Live.

487
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,720
 I am going to be at the fanfons auction being the person who checks Discord for bids on Discord

488
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,040
 and tells people on Discord what the bid in the room is and stuff like that.

489
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,520
 So that's all I'm doing, because I decided I couldn't cope with programme.

490
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,520
 I will be back on Convention programmes next year, I should think, or later this year, but

491
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
 not this one.

492
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
 Yes.

493
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,680
 So I am on.

494
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,120
 So Liz isn't on anything because as mentioned previously, Liz does not, yeah, is not a member

495
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,360
 of the Convention, but she will definitely be on OptiThought Live.

496
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:43,440
 I am on down the virtual pub, fan groups in the time of Covid-19 and beyond, which will

497
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:50,440
 be 9pm on Saturday with Marchin, Clack, Tim, Mendelies and FranDoud.

498
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:58,600
 I am on future of EasterCon at 9am on Sunday, so 12 hours later, with Phil Dyson and Faro

499
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,760
 Mendelssohn, and then I'm on the third row fandom panel on Monday at 10.30.

500
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,000
 I have to say, down the virtual pub is the item that I probably would have wanted to

501
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,320
 be on if I don't be on programme items.

502
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,040
 So I might be the audience for that one, but I might also be in the bar as it's like

503
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
 P.E.A.V.L. Saturday.

504
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,640
 I mean, I'm absolutely going to be on the one about the third row and sit in the third

505
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
 row and heckle.

506
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
 I mean, obviously.

507
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
 Yep.

508
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
 Yep.

509
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:34,120
 I assume you're going to, I assume the Convention is aware that the third row in that panel

510
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,440
 is going to need to have more chairs in it, because like, there's quite a lot of, there

511
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,360
 might be quite a lot of people wanting to sit in it.

512
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
 I don't know.

513
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,760
 It's a state of mind, John.

514
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,160
 It's not literally the third row, it is a state of mind.

515
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,560
 This will be the schism of the third row one day.

516
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,440
 A lot of people are probably very confused right now, so you'll have to come to that

517
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,560
 panel to find out what we are talking about and heckle John.

518
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
 Yes.

519
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,560
 The other programme item I'm excited to go to is the book launch of Neil Harrison's

520
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
 book.

521
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
 It's the first time I've ever seen a book launch.

522
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

532
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

533
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

534
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

535
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

555
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

556
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

557
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

558
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

562
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:25,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

563
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

564
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

565
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

566
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

567
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

568
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

569
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

570
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
 It's a book launch that I've ever seen.

571
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,560
 WorldCon, this time also used the You Can Sign Up for, you know, we'll give you a lot of

572
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,560
 the items and you can sign up for the ones you think you are interested in.

573
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
 And I see EasterCon as Confront.

574
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,560
 It's going to be interesting to see how we think that is working versus the traditional

575
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,560
 method of some programmers put you on some stuff.

576
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,560
 You decide whether it's actually the stuff you would like to be on or not.

577
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:01,560
 And then an email of varying levels of politeness based on how much we have got your subject

578
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
 matter of interest wrong.

579
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,560
 So I'm interested to see how it works.

580
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,560
 I was interested that there was, what was interesting to me is that I went on PlanZ

581
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,560
 and I filled in the, I went through the list and filled in the ones I thought might be

582
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
 good on.

583
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,560
 I think I picked out like four or five maybe and like rated one is like quite high.

584
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,560
 And then a few others are like, you know, I think I'd be interested on this but equally,

585
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,560
 I don't think I'd necessarily have unique insights or if you have someone better great.

586
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,560
 And then I went on the list of ones that they'd already sort of earmarked me for.

587
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,560
 And there were a couple where I looked at and thought, ah, it might be a good pick for that

588
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
 but equally am I just like kidding myself.

589
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
 And I was on them.

590
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
 And I was like, oh, okay.

591
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,560
 So that was kind of interesting because I was like, oh, maybe I'm like being slightly too

592
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
 like harsh on myself.

593
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,560
 It seems like they're kind of approaching it from both ways where you can express interest,

594
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,560
 but there's also clearly a level where they're like, well, you know, we know John could be

595
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
 on a panel about X.

596
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,560
 So we will sort of put him on and hope he says yes.

597
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,560
 The program items I see look good.

598
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,560
 There were a few where I was like, oh, I could be on that one but I'd also quite like to go to it.

599
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
 Which is nice.

600
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,560
 One of the ones I signed up for, but I was like, I'm going to be an arring about was one

601
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,560
 on tabletop games where I'm like, I could be on it but equally like, I wouldn't say no to just

602
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
 being in the audience.

603
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:29,560
 Listeners, if you are in the thing, you can see all of the slots that are open for signups.

604
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:35,560
 Which I think there aren't, there shouldn't be very many of those anymore because we're

605
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
 tying up.

606
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,560
 I mean, I think today is essentially the program gets finalised day.

607
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
 Okay.

608
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,560
 I mean, by today, I mean Sunday, not Thursday when you're hearing this listeners.

609
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,560
 Yeah, but people will always, you know, people will probably be dropping in and out quite

610
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
 a lot through the whole process anyway.

611
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
 It's always what happens.

612
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,560
 But yeah, I am quite enjoying basically just going to conventions and not doing anything.

613
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,560
 I mean, I did some stuff at Wilkham because I felt like, um, a finalist, I should do some

614
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,560
 things but it's quite nice to just rock up and not do anything.

615
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:13,560
 I have been asked to be involved with Glasgow's program team at a very kind of, very kind of

616
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:19,560
 undemanding level and I have said, all right, on the basis that basically they're at the

617
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,560
 just throwing ideas into a mailing list stage, which is probably about level effort.

618
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,560
 I'm willing to engage in, but Meg will be listening to this and being like, how are

619
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
 I a minute?

620
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,560
 John said yes to a Glasgow thing and then I will receive text messages being like, what else

621
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
 will you say yes to John?

622
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
 And so that's terrifying.

623
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,560
 And also Meg can play me with Booze Eastcon, which was also terrifying.

624
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:48,560
 [Music]

625
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,560
 Alison, you are hard at work on doing things for a convention.

626
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,560
 But my understanding is that convention is at least in part core flu.

627
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
 So do you want to tell us about core flu?

628
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
 Um, yes.

629
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,560
 So I am very excited about Eastcon and I am working very hard on Eastcon.

630
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,560
 But the reason I'm working very hard on Eastcon is that on Thursday morning, I'm going to

631
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,560
 be very well fast for one, two, three, four, five days and not do any more work on

632
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
 Eastcon until I get home.

633
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
 So, sorry, Eastcon.

634
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,560
 I mean, I'm sure there'll be some things, but I'm probably not going to be doing a lot

635
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,560
 of Eastcon stuff because I'm going to be sitting in a bar talking to Fazzy and Fazzy.

636
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,560
 I was just reminded of core flu very much when Liz was saying how nice it was to go to

637
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,560
 conventions and not do very much because I feel like core flu is an entire convention

638
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,560
 dedicated to go to a convention and not doing very much.

639
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,560
 Um, though there's quite a lot more program than I used to for core flu partly because

640
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,560
 some of the core flu team are about to bid to hold the Eastcon in Belfast in 2025, which

641
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
 I'm also very excited about.

642
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
 We must have talked about this on the part, right?

643
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
 Don't think we have.

644
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
 Yeah.

645
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,560
 So, so one of the things we should put on the agenda for Octa Thought Live is my impressions

646
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,560
 of the Belfast Eastcon site, which I'm hoping to see on Friday.

647
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,560
 So, so yeah, by the time you listen to this,

648
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,560
 I will be on a plane or about to get on a plane or more likely waiting around an airport or

649
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,560
 something of that kind, but then I'll be at a bar in Northern Ireland drinking, drinking

650
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
 good beer, I hope.

651
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,560
 This is pretty exciting, which is the core flu, which is not a very big convention, but

652
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,560
 this is core flu 40 and there are going to be, I think, 12 people at core flu 40 who were

653
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
 at core flu one.

654
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
 So I think that's quite good.

655
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
 Quite, you know, not a bad attrition rate.

656
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
 Right.

657
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,560
 And the core flu has quite an old demographic and it's also got quite a lot of people who

658
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,560
 you would necessarily expect me to core flu, who are excited by the fact that it's in

659
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,560
 Belfast or excited by the fact that it's a conventionally week before Eastcon or something, things of that kind.

660
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,560
 So I'm really, really looking forward to it and I'm not really doing anything for it except that

661
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,560
 they keep sending me emails saying, "Alice, I might have a view on this," and they always

662
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
 involve work.

663
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,560
 I am excited by the idea of Belfast conventions.

664
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
 I think this is good.

665
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,560
 I'm very excited about the idea of an Eastcon in Belfast and it just means that Wales needs

666
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,560
 to get its stuff together and get the Eastcon and we've had one in each of the four constituent

667
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
 blobs.

668
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
 Blobs is the safest word.

669
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,560
 And you better be quick while we still have four constituent blobs.

670
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
 Yeah, come on Wales.

671
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
 Come on.

672
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
 You've got maybe three years.

673
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
 Let's do this.

674
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
 Look, they got very close.

675
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,560
 We will have had one in four constituent blobs because of course we've had one in Jersey.

676
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
 That's true.

677
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,560
 I'm looking forward to the Belfast Eastcon.

678
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,560
 Should it be selected, which hopefully it will be?

679
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
 Will the site selection vote have happened?

680
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,560
 Are they planning to go for site selection at conversation?

681
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,560
 Yeah, there'll be site selection conversation, I believe, they'll vote.

682
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure the site selection at conversation.

683
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:56,560
 Well, some, I know that, like, for instance, Phil Dyson presented two years ahead but said

684
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,560
 like, "We're actually going to go for the vote one year ahead."

685
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
 So I know that this can be fuzzy.

686
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,560
 I believe that was just due to their, like, that was a, we'd like to bid but we are not

687
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
 yet in the position to be ready to do it.

688
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,560
 Whereas Glasgow is more, you know, not Glasgow, sorry, Belfast are, you know, I think more

689
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,560
 settled, like, they have a venue and everything.

690
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
 So.

691
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,560
 My understanding is that they are bidding this year and if they're not, could they please

692
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,560
 tell us Pronto because I think that's also the chair's understanding.

693
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,560
 I'd let you, you'll be able to tell us how cold flu was as well at the Eastcon Live.

694
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,560
 Although we might be distracted by talking about how Eastcon was.

695
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,560
 I just, I just, good chance I won't remember a lot of it.

696
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
 You might have to take notes.

697
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,560
 I mean, as I recall, last year there was not a lot of actual, like, full-on content at all

698
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,560
 but we can, we can aim for that this year.

699
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
 Oh yeah, now.

700
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,560
 This is a good, this is a good point.

701
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,560
 We would like to encourage listeners to send us things for us to talk about at Eastcon.

702
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
 Oh yeah!

703
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,560
 If you are listening and you think that there is something you would like to hear, please

704
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,560
 write in because we never have any idea what to talk about and we just want to talk about

705
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
 what you want to listen to.

706
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
 So.

707
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
 That's not always true.

708
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,560
 Sometimes we like to talk about the hard things that you don't want to listen to but

709
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
 you need to.

710
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,560
 But at the Eastcon Live show, what we want to do is be very gentle and lovely and just

711
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,560
 talk about shiny things.

712
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,560
 So yes, if you have any ideas, please write in.

713
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,560
 Can I do.

714
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,560
 Oct-Thorp Gaming's Corner, sponsored by Mark Plummer.

715
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,560
 Mark Plummer, for when you need information but in a funny way.

716
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,560
 New tagline, Mark, if you need to get that old business cards, I charge no fee.

717
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,560
 So basically, I went on a work trip for two weeks and I took a bunch of solo board games

718
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
 and they make work trips while less boring.

719
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
 It was good.

720
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,560
 And I don't know whether I've ever picked it on the podcast.

721
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,560
 And this isn't a pick, obviously, because I would be greedy.

722
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 But under falling skies is a solo board game I took with me to the States and I played

723
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
 that a bunch.

724
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
 And it was good.

725
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:15,560
 And I also took a print and play of Arkham Noir, which is a solo card game, which I can't.

726
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,560
 I'm not sure if it's good.

727
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:25,560
 It's enjoyable, but I won twice out of two games and I'm a bit like it's challenging.

728
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,560
 But I might need to play again on high difficulty and see whether that improves it.

729
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
 But yeah, no, solo board games.

730
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
 They're nice.

731
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
 But I'm glad to be back.

732
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,560
 And the reason I'm going to a friend's house this afternoon and this is a short record,

733
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,560
 that's because I'm going to a friend's house and I'm going to play games with other people,

734
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,560
 which I haven't done since before last time we recorded.

735
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,560
 I also love solo games and I, in fact, have both of the ones John mentioned, both in print

736
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,560
 and play versions rather than I think John has the commercial version of under falling skies.

737
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,560
 But the print and play is free and you can go and download it and print it and it's not fun.

738
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,560
 And I did a bit of big wine yesterday, which was like, oh God, my entire life is getting up

739
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,560
 and not playing games and doing EasterCon actions all day and then falling asleep.

740
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,560
 And my daughter came over and we played Terraforming Mars, which is quite a long fuck.

741
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,560
 Tony took us four hours this time, which is faster than the previous time.

742
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,560
 Are you eventually going to pick Terraforming Mars?

743
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,560
 Oh.

744
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:31,560
 Because, you know, that is the sort of thing that on a future episode you could pick because it is an SF work.

745
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
 It's from 2016, yes.

746
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
 I don't know if we picked it yet, though.

747
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:41,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

748
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

749
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

750
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

751
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

752
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

753
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

754
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

755
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

756
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,560
 I'm not sure if we can get it out of the way.

757
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,560
 I think I do that. That is quite excellent.

758
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,560
 Yeah.

759
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,560
 I mean, I would like to see someone, I mean, I've only played the Terraforming Mars card game with Jump,

760
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,560
 but I would like to see someone option Terraforming Mars and Tonya Video.

761
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,560
 Basically, someone wants to make the Mars Trilogy, but the Mars Trilogy is still under option,

762
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
 so they're doing Terraforming Mars potentially.

763
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
 Yeah.

764
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:27,560
 I mean, I guess, but like, Terraforming Mars is like just a game about, I mean, obviously, it's a game about Terraforming Mars, right?

765
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,560
 This is not surprising.

766
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,560
 But like, it's not like the Expanse is about Terraforming Mars.

767
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,560
 They didn't, I don't understand what it is you're optioning.

768
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,560
 Like, the concept of Terraforming Mars is something you can make a movie about.

769
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,560
 And they said like, "Oh, we want to explore like colonialism."

770
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,560
 And I'm like, "The board game doesn't touch on colonialism at all."

771
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,560
 I, it's really, I don't understand.

772
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,560
 I guess it's so that they can call it Terraforming Mars and get the board game friends in.

773
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,560
 But I don't know how much money that's worth.

774
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,560
 Clearly something because they spent money on it.

775
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,560
 But, um, but yeah, odd.

776
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,560
 I was a bit non-plus when you said you could take it as a pick because

777
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:09,560
 nothing I like about it really has a lot to do with the theme, you know?

778
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,560
 But that doesn't matter.

779
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
 Yeah, okay.

780
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,560
 Let's, let's take this another time.

781
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
 I mean, I, I do.

782
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
 Well, hang on. No.

783
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,560
 I mean, I don't mean, I don't mean like, there is the argument artistically that it doesn't matter.

784
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,560
 But like, my first pick, this episode was peer pressure.

785
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,560
 Uh, and it's not, I didn't pick that for the SF, no quality of the idea.

786
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,560
 I picked it for the lulls.

787
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,560
 And so I do think it's important that we have a rule that sometimes we're allowed to, like,

788
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,560
 we don't necessarily have to pick things for the broad philosophical conversations they unlock.

789
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,560
 Listeners will be like, but you always pick things for the broad philosophical questions they unlock.

790
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,560
 Obviously, uh, we pay attention.

791
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,560
 Okay. Fair. Um, yeah, no.

792
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
 So a future pick, Terraforming Mars, maybe.

793
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,560
 Um, so yeah, I did squeeze a four-hour board game into yesterday.

794
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,560
 And watch the second episode to tell us.

795
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,560
 That was the "Oltutthot" podcast.

796
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,560
 And it's goodbye for me.

797
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
 It's goodbye from me.

798
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
 It's goodbye from me.

799
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,560
 "Plan Z" was the name given to the planned re-equipment and expansion of the Kriegsmöder

800
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,560
 in order by Hitler in early 1939.

801
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,560
 I do not think that is the plan Z that I'm looking for.

802
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,560
 Possibly you shouldn't have a piece of software used for your schedule where if you Google for it,

803
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,560
 you get a thing about Hitler.

804
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,560
 I don't know how to diplomatically put that in the thing.

805
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,560
 No, I think just like, if I was naming a thing that is not, I would just like, I don't know anything.

806
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,560
 The first thing I do is Google it to see if there's anything else with the same name.

807
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,560
 And while I appreciate that this is not in the similar vein that's going to be confusion,

808
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,560
 you probably don't want it to be a thing that people Google and go, "Oh, I just did."

809
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,560
 No, that is true.

810
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,560
 I'm sure it wasn't the intent, but it might be that after this year,

811
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:17,560
 that name could be sort of politely retired in favor of something less, uh, Hitler-y.

812
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,560
 I mean, I suspect it's- if it is a fork of Zambia, then that's a reason to use it.

813
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,560
 100% that's probably why.

814
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:30,560
 Listeners write in, but did it take us 80 episodes to trigger Godwin's law?

815
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
 Because that's a pretty good run.

816
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,560
 It's possible, yeah.

817
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,560
 I really think you should cut this stuff out.

818
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,560
 I mean, we can see.

819
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:45,560

 This podcast will end at the beep.

 Beep.
