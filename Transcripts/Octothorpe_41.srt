1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
 Right, well, I have fun editing that into something that's not too

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,640
 defamatory, but still makes sense. And if you need me to do a drop in of any

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,720
 and all bits of that later, I can do it.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:28,880
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 41st episode of Octa Thorpe, the podcast for

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,480
 science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 30th of

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,200
 September. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Elizabethie.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,360
 So we are recording at an unusual time because John's busy. It is now at a perfectly

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,040
 reasonable time for John and for me, but very late at night for Liz. And when I, when we

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,760
 recorded a bad time for me, I have nine cups of coffee in order to feign

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,400
 a wakefulness. And I have suggested this approach to Liz and she's like, now,

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,960
 no, that seems like a terrible idea. And I have to question her commitment to the

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,840
 podcast at this point. Liz. Yeah, but if it's, I think if we're

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,800
 recording a podcast at 10 a.m. and Alison never asked to drink six cups of coffee,

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,520
 that is a little different than if you're recording a podcast at 10 p.m.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,800
 And I've got work tomorrow. And we're just accommodating John for having a life.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,560
 Yeah, how dare you, John? Yep. Sorry. So we had some letters of comment. We had a

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,800
 letter comment from Chris Garcia, who has cracked his knuckles and loosened his neck.

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,000
 And he says, okay, let's do this. The five best high school films are Heather's

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,960
 Scream election, 10 things I hate about you and the breakfast club. I think I've seen two of those.

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,360
 I think I have seen all five of those. It's a long time since I've seen Scream, but I think we're

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,840
 slightly stretching high school movie to include films with people of high school age who all get

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,360
 killed. Sorry, that's probably a spoiler for Scream, isn't it? I'm pretty sure the blonde girl

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,880
 gets away at the end of the movie. Now that's a spoiler. I don't know because I haven't seen Scream.

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,520
 I am, I am extrapolating from other movies that I have seen. One of my favorite high school movies

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,840
 is Final Destination 3 by the same logic, Kraken movie. Frandau has also posted about high school

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,560
 movies in the OctaThought Facebook group. If you're on Facebook, you might like to join the OctaThought

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,480
 Facebook group where you get prime content like this. She says, if, which is a good, good call,

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,880
 I'd say, back to the future, which is definitively a high school movie, Ghost World, The History Boys,

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:54,400
 Kooties, um, Subtrinians, which we did actually mention. Frandau said, had John heard of Centriniens?

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,840
 Yep, I have. I thought T'Lula Riley was very good in that movie. I assume that's the remake of

31
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,920
 Centriniens, of which we shall not speak. War Games, the prom, which has Ariana to boast in it,

32
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,160
 so I'm going to check that out. Was there an original Centriniens? No, put in my leg. We're not

33
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,760
 falling for that one. School That Forever. Oh, and Clueless, which nobody has previously mentioned,

34
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,240
 but Ang Rossin mentioned. School of Rock. School of Rock is a good choice, yes?

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,720
 Did anyone mention School of Rock? Because that's definitely the best high school movie.

36
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,960
 Have you seen If? Have you heard of If? Um, I thought you'd mispronounced it. Uh, no, don't know

37
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,080
 if I've seen If. No, well, I mean, you'd have to go away. Will we be setting John Ho'Work from the

38
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,820
 past. If is definitely worth watching. There are many films called if. So this is my

39
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:54,380
 have to tell me which year if dot dot dot. Now there's really anyone. Ah from 1968.

40
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:01,700
 Starring Malcolm McDowell. Yep I am not aware of that one either. That is before my time.

41
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:08,960
 Sorry. Oh god. Oh god young people are young. I think Heather's probably has some things

42
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,160
 in common with if. My brother Dave messaged me saying as a layer of

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,720
 comment what the fuck is Heather's I've never heard of it and I was like fair

44
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,560
 enough. It turns out the people who have similar

45
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,040
 upgree rings have similar cultural references. Who knew? Yep. He also says he

46
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
 loves the instruction of the pick feature so that's good. I've been I've

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,400
 forgotten we had a Facebook group to be honest so there's a whole discussion

48
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,600
 about high school movie so I was completely unaware of. It's quite good. What I

49
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,800
 like about that though is that because Alison has also forgotten that we had a

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,160
 Facebook group because the last time she posted it was to plug episode 31. Yes I

51
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,400
 do need to remember to plug Octa Thorpe in the Facebook group every single time.

52
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,040
 I will get better but join our Facebook group. We'll put a link in the comments

53
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,400
 not that Facebook links work very well but there we go. I also forget to tweet it

54
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,960
 but I think Jordan usually sorts me out. Basically you might be getting the

55
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,760
 impression that the bulk of the work on this podcast is done by John. Thank you

56
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,600
 John. The thing is I don't use Facebook very often and so and this may explain

57
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,320
 why our listenership is not quite as great as it might be but we have a very

58
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,080
 engaged listenership as a proportion of the total listenership which is I think

59
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,800
 all of them. This is your cuter writer to say no no no long time listener first

60
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,280
 time correspondent here. Having discussed high school movies in some depth we

61
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,600
 should move on to topics. Oh hang on what's the discord mention from Emily

62
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,360
 after Eliz? Well it's about high school movies. Hey seamlessly we've gotten. She

63
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,400
 says Heather's is great but the musical is even better and I was like I'd also

64
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,200
 the musical brought Heather's to a new generation and I'm now going to do a

65
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,880
 John here and go well there was a musical so I'm gonna have to look that up. It had

66
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,240
 quite a short West End run apparently. I mean to say with Beetlejuice isn't it

67
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,200
 that they made a musical of Beetlejuice 30 years after the fact that it's quite

68
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,040
 popular with a whole different generation. Beetlejuice best high school movie.

69
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:30,840
 Finally just on something that isn't high school movies. Bug Bredshaw tweeted

70
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,160
 others to say that you can totally have a microphone in a mask if it stands

71
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,360
 proud from the face like the masks with clear plastic panels. It puts the mic in

72
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,200
 the same good position as a headset mic. One way they sanitize those mics is

73
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,040
 20 minutes each side in an ultra-vio that box.

74
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,160
 Hello everyone it's John here just a quick pick up before we get into the rest of

75
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,720
 the episode. The next episode will be our episode 42 and so if you have any

76
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,600
 reminiscences or stories or other things you would like to share with us that

77
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,240
 are connected to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or to Douglas Adams please

78
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,000
 do email them in because we will be doing a segment next episode all about

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,560
 Douglas Adams and the Hitchhiker's Guide. Thank you very much I hope you enjoy the

80
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,400
 rest of the episode.

81
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:38,480
 We have some stuff to say about Novocon. Novocon has announced a COVID policy

82
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,400
 which they posted on their Facebook page and there will be a link in the

83
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,640
 show notes. So they've basically worked with the hotel they have some

84
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,000
 limitations because the hotel's requirements for its own staff aren't as

85
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,920
 rigorous as Novocon wanted to put in place but it is still not bad. They're

86
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,600
 going to try and have spacing where possible. There will be separate entrances

87
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,160
 and exits in the dealer's room at art show. They'll be sanitizing. All the hotel

88
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,840
 staff will be double vaccinated. All the program rooms apart from the main

89
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,000
 program have windows that can be open for airflow. The main program room has

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,560
 high ceilings and far escape doors that they will open and they're going to

91
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,640
 require masks in the main program unless you're on the panel. Masks while moving

92
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,760
 around the hotel, not masks in the bar areas, they ask you to be back sedated.

93
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,440
 Where possible? They ask you to take a lateral flow test prior to attending

94
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,600
 the convention. They don't say that they're mandating any of that but we

95
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,480
 could ask them. They say please do not host or attend room parties which is

96
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,320
 probably pretty sensible. Please don't attend if you think you have COVID.

97
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,160
 Pretty sensible. So I think it's pretty good. It looks good. That'd be the

98
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,680
 basically thought through and made reasonable judgments which is all we

99
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:02,040
 ask. This all looks very sensible. I think, you know, I have a few kind of

100
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,080
 queries and questions about how some of this will be done but like in general

101
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,440
 this is exactly the sort of thing that I think convention should be doing and

102
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,680
 it's all very good and this means that I will feel pretty comfortable attending

103
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,240
 Novocon and having a good old time which is something that I

104
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,040
 am quite looking forward to achieving. Yep, yes I too am very much looking

105
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,360
 forward to going to Novocon. It'll be good. So Corflou, I think we're still

106
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,040
 waiting for yours. Who else is happening in person is that it?

107
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,480
 Well at the time of recording we are a couple of days before fantasy con.

108
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,440
 Yes they're the first in-person convention this weekend.

109
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,960
 Mm-hmm or last weekend as you're listening to this.

110
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,760
 Yeah we talked about fantasy cons rather bare bones.

111
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,120
 Bare bones is a good word for a basic over policy.

112
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,480
 Last time I think. So I'm having a quick look at

113
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,760
 fantasy cons list of activities which will all have happened

114
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,880
 by the time you listen to this podcast but haven't at time of recording.

115
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,160
 So we don't know how fantasy con was but if you were at fantasy con

116
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,360
 do write and tell us what you thought and then we'll talk about next time.

117
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,880
 Oh yes yes please do do that. Because none of us going.

118
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,640
 And obviously there's nothing listed. There's no parties listed, there's no

119
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,120
 book launches, there's no kind of events or activities listed that would involve

120
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,440
 any sort of mingling like that. It's basically all panels and readings

121
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,360
 are the only kind of programmed items. I think that is interesting because

122
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,840
 obviously even if you can go back to being in person there might be things

123
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,960
 that you're not doing. You're not having kind of a big disco.

124
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,000
 You're not having like book launches with wine. You're not having

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,520
 big parties, bid parties, room parties. Basically none of those things can happen.

126
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,080
 And so then you kind of but you do need to provide

127
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,360
 something so maybe you start filling up those late night hours with more

128
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,640
 panels and readings and so on than you might otherwise put in.

129
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,600
 Or you try and encourage people to socialise in more covid friendly ways

130
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,520
 like outdoors or in smaller groups or more spaced out.

131
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,560
 But maybe not in the way that we're kind of used to doing

132
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,880
 in the evening at conventions where you basically all cram in the bar

133
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,440
 and shout to the physics hours. Vauxhall!

134
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,240
 I think maybe there is an argument here and I'm not expecting Ramthas. He gone to be

135
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,480
 the ones to do it because I think it's early. But I think there is an argument

136
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,040
 here that we need to think a little bit about how we

137
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,040
 port social experiences into a world where we want to prioritize ventilation and

138
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,880
 kind of covid safety in physical spaces because I

139
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,680
 understand why they're probably showing away from those sorts of events. But it

140
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,720
 strikes me that like if the hotel has a beer card and

141
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,800
 it would not be impossible to put those events on and just have them outside.

142
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,880
 Patio heaters. Patio heaters exactly that kind of thing.

143
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,520
 Stocking patio heaters for this winter I would say. Dry robes.

144
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,240
 We had an entirely outside pub crawl a few weeks ago

145
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,880
 by just taking huge advantage of beer gardens and I appreciate burning them.

146
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,360
 Probably has fewer beer gardens. Is that right? I don't think it's north but still.

147
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,800
 No, everywhere has beer gardens now. I've got to say I've actually just looked at

148
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,320
 a slightly different page because there is a Google Doc linked elsewhere on the

149
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,440
 fancy con website which appears to include a lot more items than

150
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,640
 we're on the page I was looking at and actually there are a whole load of

151
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,800
 book launches and indeed apparently Friday evening karaoke.

152
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,360
 So you can just ignore everything I said about not being able to do those items

153
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,560
 they will be doing those items.

154
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,080
 Fantasy cons program is in a superposition between

155
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,760
 happening and not happening depending on which pages of the internet you look at

156
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,480
 and at the time of recording it is impossible to

157
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,120
 collapse it into a single wave function. If you went around to the on please tell

158
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,760
 us what the wave function looked like after it was observed we would love to know.

159
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,160
 Yeah we might have to do a drop in on Monday morning.

160
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,680
 This is the sort of thing that it strikes me that a book launch could be done with

161
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,840
 kind of cocktail style seating and kind of more you know I mean table

162
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,040
 service might be slightly the wrong word but like you could have drinks on tables

163
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,920
 and encourage people to sit around the table and have that kind of experience in a way

164
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,960
 much less mingly than it would be normally but which was potentially

165
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,680
 better than nothing. So I'll be interested to see how fantasy con has done this

166
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,400
 and as I say if you attended please do let us know.

167
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,160
 And it does also say that the look launches are in a big room so possibly

168
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,840
 they have a sufficiently large room that you can actually have quite a lot of people

169
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,880
 say it's sitting at tables. I don't see where do they have their

170
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,160
 I'm on fantasy con.org but it seems to be about oh hang on do I have to click 2021

171
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,920
 I see and then I can go. It's fantasy con.org I've loaded it.

172
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,320
 Yeah so you have to click on 2021 because somewhere is it 2022

173
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,600
 and even then you don't end up at the actual main website

174
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,720
 which is somewhere else. Oh yes that's really weird

175
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,600
 because their website seems to be for the 2022 one

176
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,160
 and I don't see and I see the 2021 page but I don't see a link to the

177
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,160
 program at all so I'm not sure. Yeah no because that's because I'm a totally

178
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,680
 different page. Okay I mean it's not entirely different website.

179
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,240
 Oh fantasy con website is quite strange because the main fantasy con website

180
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,560
 is the website for next year's convention. This is a problem that

181
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,640
 Eastercons could have because Eastercons are independent in the same way

182
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,840
 but in practice don't tend to. I had not seen this website

183
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,600
 interesting and it looks like they are trying to run as much of

184
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,480
 a kind of just fully standard convention as possible

185
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,600
 but it looks like they do have a lot of book launches

186
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,120
 but they're putting them in their biggest function room so presumably they

187
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,520
 could be as spaced out as possible and being fancy con they do have the

188
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,680
 fancy con banquet and the British Fantasy Award and they also have a karaoke

189
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,760
 session on Friday night so I mean it's interesting to me

190
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,520
 that I would say you could make panels a little more

191
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,120
 covid safe you can have everyone master part from possibly the panelists but

192
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,840
 it's probably more difficult to make things covid safe if

193
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,240
 everyone is moving and mingling and eating and drinking and potentially

194
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,720
 making a lot of aerosols by doing karaoke. Yeah karaoke well-known covid

195
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,840
 safe activity. So it's interesting that they're kind of going fully

196
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,520
 back in to kind of not even the new normal the new normal is

197
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,200
 the old normal I think so I'll be very interested here if anyone is there

198
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,760
 at how it went although possibly you do karaoke by having the entire karaoke

199
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,040
 audience at the back of the room and the one person doing karaoke at the front

200
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,880
 which could be quite funny or you could have the person seeing the karaoke

201
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,040
 face away from the audience you could have the person doing karaoke

202
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,840
 in a box there's a microphone sanitizing issue too

203
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,680
 call back to the letters of comment now listeners if you don't mind sanitizing

204
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,760
 your karaoke microphone for 20 minutes in an ultraviolet box

205
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,720
 you can have very safe karaoke from a microphone sanitization standpoint

206
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,640
 so you just need enough microphones that you have

207
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,800
 you can always have a microphone out of the box at any given time in an

208
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,440
 elaborate system of different colored tape on each microphone. Yeah that's not

209
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:31,160
 how karaoke works ever is it? No it may not be. You could potentially have karaoke

210
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,520
 with no microphones and then it becomes a competition of who has the best

211
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,680
 operatic projection but i'm not sure you want to be encouraging maximum aerosols

212
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,440
 right now so i but i guess this means it's feasible for panels you would need

213
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,360
 essentially twice as many sets of microphones as you had

214
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,720
 panels and then you could have an hour in between each panel to put the

215
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,880
 microphones in a little sanitizing box i assume you could buy little sanitizing

216
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,560
 boxes i assume so too and if you buy a lot of

217
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,480
 sanitizing boxes you can use some of them as UV lights for the rave aspect

218
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,800
 i don't know whether fantasy con is famous for its raves

219
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,160
 if you buy enough UV boxes you could probably use them as little mini gel

220
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,200
 docs and do on the spot PCR testing

221
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:21,960
 okay you can't i see us all giving liz a cladding from the audience today at this point

222
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,520
 we are looking forward to octagon when i will not have a cold because my

223
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,960
 immune system is now functioning properly and will not be

224
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,200
 severely depleted by random viruses octagon i don't think it's having

225
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,080
 um kind of explicit guests of honor but they are highlighting

226
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,720
 kind of regular octagon attendees on their website so that's quite good kind

227
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,040
 of just bits and bobs about kind of people who come to octagon and be

228
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:00,440
 well they're excited to see um at the convention um there's some cool

229
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,320
 people on that list previous guests of honor and just

230
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,440
 interesting bobs um and they've got their uh program

231
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,880
 um kind of online so they've got some talks and some workshops which are

232
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,720
 happening um on zoom um and the social fabric of the

233
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,920
 convention is happening through discord um and anyone who went to a

234
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,960
 concentration will be relatively comfortable with this

235
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,120
 kind of thing um one that leaves out to me that i won't be able to go to

236
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,760
 ooh i'll be back from holiday then i might be able to go to it

237
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,520
 is paul carol is doing a workshop on how to write

238
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,440
 comic scripts um which is potentially something that would be quite

239
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,120
 interesting and there's also going to be some role-playing games

240
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,520
 um which you know all good including the alien rpg

241
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,000
 system which i think is the new one which is

242
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,760
 potentially quite interesting and there's an adorable picture of an octopus

243
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,760
 octopus with 2d 20s and antlers and the staff

244
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:05,720
 oh they're a little octopier so cute yeah no octagon has the best graphic

245
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,240
 design game of any convention and i will probably go to the workshop of

246
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,960
 making your own crocheted octo because i'm going to be doing some in front of

247
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,360
 the convention anyway so i'm going to make an octo

248
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,040
 that sounds like quite good actually i'm not sure i can crochet well enough for

249
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,760
 it do i need to have got do i need a hook i probably have a hook

250
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,800
 uh they say you need about 25 grams of yarn

251
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,320
 uh decay if possible and a crochet hook between about three or five

252
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,560
 millimeters or one to match the way of the answer

253
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,680
 basically go and like scound around and i'm sure you can find yeah i'm sure i

254
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,400
 have both these things you know a small bit of yarn

255
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,760
 and i definitely have loads of stuff what i love about this

256
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,560
 is that when you said 25 grams of yarn my immediate thought was

257
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,720
 like i didn't know they measured yarn in grams and it makes me think of cocaine

258
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,120
 and having met people who have yarn as a like yarn addictions one might say

259
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,320
 that actually seems like a very apt comparison because i know several

260
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,200
 people who who buy yarn who basically their houses are 70

261
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,200
 percent yarn at this point well i mean i think usually so what

262
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,320
 is that i think the thing is with cocaine you don't normally just like

263
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,200
 stash loads of it for later just in case um i'm not sure that's how that works

264
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,480
 no true my understanding is it's quite moreish

265
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,560
 i mean generally i think it's if i look at patterns they usually

266
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,720
 have it in meters or yards but if i just have some scrap wool

267
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,280
 lying around i don't know how much that is in

268
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,160
 yards but i can wait it until he how much is in grams

269
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,680
 so it's quite practical we may have gone off topic

270
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:46,360
 into yarn fandom i mean yeah yarn is pretty

271
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,240
 genre adjacent

272
00:20:49,240 --> 00:21:02,120
 i was going to go to firecon last weekend but i didn't it was online

273
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:09,800
 um but i caught what i believe is a disease known as a common cold

274
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,560
 um and i have multiple lateral flow tests

275
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,520
 negative lateral flow tests to support this and i have all

276
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,800
 i am waiting for the result of a PCR test

277
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,560
 it turns out that my body used to have an immune system

278
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,600
 but it kind of went oh i haven't used this for a year and it

279
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,400
 doesn't spark joy so i'm going to get rid of that

280
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,800
 and um as a result i had a cold like nobody's ever had a cold before it was

281
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,360
 like manon flu or something like that and i was very very poorly

282
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,520
 um for a cold but i'm better now um

283
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,440
 mostly better now a bit i'm a bit husky but i'm okay otherwise

284
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,400
 so that was why i didn't go to firecon because instead of going to firecon

285
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,880
 i spent two days in bed watching youtube videos

286
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,160
 and sleeping a lot so and then a third day when i managed to get up

287
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,720
 just a bit so yeah quite poorly but as you had a membership

288
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,600
 right you can catch up at a later date yes but we all know i'm not going to do

289
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,480
 that but yeah i've got a couple of weeks right to

290
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,600
 catch things on youtube and people keep telling me that there's marvelous

291
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,320
 stuff so i could but you know you want to know what your

292
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,920
 strengths and weaknesses are and i think one of my weaknesses is that i don't

293
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,760
 do that sort of thing very much i think you have much longer

294
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,440
 potentially oh good that'd be good yeah yes

295
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,720
 everything i heard about firecon is that it was fantastic and i did enjoy

296
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,360
 the fringe as it was last year and fully intended to go again

297
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,440
 this year and forgot but i also wouldn't have been able to tend any of it live

298
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,360
 because of time zones and so on so oh but they had they had the bonfire

299
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,560
 they did although they did have the bonfire which would have been in my

300
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,720
 time zone however it is i think not recorded

301
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,360
 and i was actually out doing things during the day last weekend

302
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,480
 anyway so for last for last year's con they

303
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,600
 kept the archives for a year so you'll have to see

304
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,440
 what happens this year so you have a year in which you can feel guilty you

305
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,400
 haven't watched them yet and we can regularly remind

306
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,960
 Alison had she watched any firecon or does she just feel guilty

307
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,560
 every every episode listeners we will do a new feature called did Alison

308
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,320
 watch the firecon program yet and it will just be Alison saying

309
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,920
 no every time and because i know i'm the same like i have the best intentions

310
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,120
 and then i never catch up with the program

311
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,040
 yeah but i am i'm a person who doesn't even have the best intentions at this

312
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,360
 point i'm not i know exactly how overcommitted i am

313
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,800
 i'm sure your intentions are very lovely one thing that did happen at firecon

314
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,080
 was the uh ignite awards which were announced

315
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,720
 and Liz you said things about the ignite awards before you're recorded

316
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,000
 so do you want to speak a little bit about these

317
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,800
 so they also announced the winners of the 2021 ignite awards which are the

318
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,680
 firecon annual awards and they have multiple categories best

319
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,840
 novel of adult you know adult middle grade um i've got to say i haven't

320
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,760
 actually read any of the winners unfortunately but i have read some of

321
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,200
 the nominees that i really quite liked i think we've discussed before the city

322
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,160
 we became by nk jemisin was on there and also vagabonds by how jing fang was

323
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,840
 a nominee for best adult novel um in the best ya novel i read elatzo

324
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,280
 a by darcy little badger which i thoroughly enjoyed and i think

325
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,320
 john europeic fan of ray bearer ray bearer is really good i enjoyed it i

326
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,280
 probably don't i don't know whether i like it more than lats away i've been

327
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,160
 going back and forth on that um the one that won legend born i've also read i

328
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,240
 thought it was by far weaker than both of the others which i find

329
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,880
 interesting i haven't read so i've read the winner of best novel which black

330
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,120
 son by rebecca roanhorse which i thought was good

331
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,320
 and probably better than the jemisin but i haven't read the other three

332
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,560
 um and i've read riot baby which i thought was really good

333
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,240
 and i've read the inaccessibility of heaven by eliette de baudard

334
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,000
 uh which i also thought was really good um and i've read the parable of the

335
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,320
 sohor comic which won for best comics team i'm not sure what

336
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,160
 i guess that means you can nominate a creative team regardless of like

337
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,240
 exactly when the trade paperbacks came out like it's understood that you're

338
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,520
 nominating the team behind a work rather than like a

339
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,120
 specific trade paperback but um but yeah um but i i enjoyed that as well

340
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,400
 um generally speaking the ones that i have read of the winners

341
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,360
 seem good except for legend born which i didn't really

342
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,040
 didn't really care for uh but which clearly other people liked

343
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,880
 yeah i guess the drive dominating best comics team is you don't end up with

344
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,800
 weird situations where you know an ongoing comic which is divided into

345
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,920
 arcs gets nominated in multiple parts or you know versus a comic which is

346
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,960
 ongoing but it also would allow you to do things like

347
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,600
 comics which are divided into arcs which are drawn by different

348
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,120
 artists but have the same right difference and i guess you could nominate

349
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,800
 them as a as a team in whatever form that you wanted

350
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 i think it's a pretty good way of doing it yeah yeah and also one thing i will

351
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,480
 say is that it's interesting to me um that the

352
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,680
 short lists like the the nominated works for the

353
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,960
 categories that have a Hugo Award equivalent art generally

354
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,920
 kind of there is some overlap there um in every category except for best

355
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,840
 short story which is um five completely different stories

356
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,080
 which i guess goes to show like how much breadth there is in the genre

357
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,360
 in short stories at the moment um novelette uh the only one that crosses

358
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,560
 over is the winner at the in the inaccessibility of heaven

359
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,720
 uh the other the other four are also uh different in the

360
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,360
 ignite short list than they are in the best short story Hugo Award

361
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,800
 finalists so i thought that was quite interesting uh and probably says

362
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,240
 something about just how much shorter fiction there is

363
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,440
 kind of available in the genre um at the moment

364
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,400
 golden age etc etc if you look at the short story nominations

365
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,040
 in the hugos and you look at how long the tale is of stories with a handful of

366
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,200
 nominations in short story versus novelette and novella

367
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,160
 is them much much longer tale and especially i think

368
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,320
 the novella market um in some ways is expanded because um

369
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,520
 tor.com published an awful lot of novellas but i think um maybe we've lost

370
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,800
 some of the other venues that might you know magazines that might publish

371
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,400
 novellas so i think there's a much smaller pool

372
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,120
 but there are also some really good novellas coming out

373
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,040
 so i don't think it's it's not that the pool is so small you can't have a

374
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,840
 really cracking short list it's just that the number of short stories is

375
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,840
 immense yeah all right for the genre yeah yeah

376
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,560
 to segue seamlessly from the breadth of short fiction into picks

377
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,520
 i have recently been reading issue one of

378
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,600
 constellatheon magazine um which i have been thoroughly

379
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,920
 enjoying uh for those who don't know um that was a magazine which is bilingual

380
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,840
 in english and spanish uh and it has english stories that are translated

381
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,960
 in spanish and spanish stories that are translated into english

382
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,720
 and so if you if you um get an issue it will have both

383
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,960
 versions of each story in um it was on kickstarter a while ago

384
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,960
 i kickstied the first issue and yeah i've been really enjoying it i will put a

385
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,160
 link in the show notes to where you can go and read it online

386
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,480
 um i really enjoyed the bowels kurtador and older stories

387
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,840
 um so far uh i would think about halfway through

388
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,040
 issue one um but it's really good and it has convinced me to back it on patreon

389
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,960
 um so yeah that is very good uh and i have been very much enjoying

390
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,720
 reading that and especially like getting a glimpse into spanish language

391
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,960
 sf um although i am not sufficiently fluent in spanish

392
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,080
 to be able to read the stories in the spanish without having to look a lot of

393
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,800
 words up on the way i refuse to select anything

394
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,920
 for my picks that i have not completely consumed at

395
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,760
 which is a bit of a problem because i have been dipping in and out to multiple

396
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,360
 tv shows and also reading a very long space opera book which is very good so

397
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,760
 far but i've got to read the other 200 pages to tell you if it it finishes well

398
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,160
 um so i'm going to have a non genre pick um because the one thing i have watched

399
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,000
 in fall and the past ten days is the later series of nailed it

400
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,440
 the baking show on netflix um where essentially people try and make really

401
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,000
 elaborate cakes and always fail to make the really elaborate cakes

402
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,400
 and you know allison was asking is this not kind of really mean but i think the

403
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,960
 thing is at least by the point of series six

404
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,520
 everyone who goes on this show knows they will completely fail to make the cakes

405
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,040
 they do not get enough time there is no way they have enough time to make them

406
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,320
 but it's about kind of who can do the best job

407
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,440
 and the the co-hosts have such a kind of lovely chemistry and kind of gentle

408
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,000
 mockery of each other and the rest of the crew

409
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,040
 um and it's also clear now that people are coming on the show because they really

410
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,800
 want to meet the people who host the show and have them say something nice about

411
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,520
 their cakes and also i get that it's probably very

412
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,400
 difficult to bake under pressure when you're being you know filmed in a tv

413
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,520
 studio and you're very excited but if one more person

414
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,240
 takes their cake out of the oven and puts them straight in the chiller and

415
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,560
 doesn't realize that this means that they will

416
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,520
 all the oil will you know chill and the cakes will then be stuck to the tin

417
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,400
 then i think any of the contestants really need to watch the previous six

418
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,160
 series in order to not do that also there is an episode in which they do

419
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,440
 blind baking of pies where you put the beans in to

420
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,080
 uh so the pastry bakes without bubbles and this is a bit of a spoiler

421
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,040
 but more than one contested leaves the beans in

422
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,760
 that fair enough that's quite funny it's got Adrian Pimento on it from Brooklyn

423
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,280
 Nine-Nine who also played Derek in the good place

424
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,920
 Derek and that is something that has tempted me to watch it in the past

425
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,600
 should we all three say Derek at the same time Derek

426
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,960
 they do in fact call Jason Manzukas on the later series because

427
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,920
 presuming he was off filming somewhere and couldn't come and be a judge

428
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,760
 so they just basically call him for absolutely no reason other than it's

429
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,560
 quite nice to call up Jason Manzukas and he might say something funny

430
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,240
 they have excellent guest judges as well that's awesome i might have to

431
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,920
 load that up so so i have three picks

432
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,720
 um i have a thing which is which you can go and watch i'm going to talk

433
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,760
 about it very quickly which is kind of genre adjacent

434
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:59,800
 which is that on i-player at the moment there is a 1975 adaptation of three men

435
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,480
 in a boat where the three men are Tim Curry who

436
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,000
 is genre adjacent Michael Palin who is pretty genre

437
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,960
 adjacent i would say and Steven Moore who is genre adjacent

438
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,920
 Marvin the paranoid android indeed and the adaptation was done by

439
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:24,120
 Tom Stoppard and the entire thing is directed by Steven Fries and it's not

440
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,640
 actually as good as you might expect given that but it's still pretty good

441
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,400
 it's only an hour ago watch it um that's obviously three men in a boat

442
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,400
 being a historical account of a boating trip

443
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,000
 through Oxford and in Varroons is not very genre but there you go

444
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,080
 and then i have a thing which is genre having mentioned Wuber a last time and

445
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,200
 for my guff report i read Blast Off at Wubera by Hugh Walters and i enjoyed

446
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,000
 it more than i expected to um so it's quite a

447
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,240
 volicking story about the daring do of boys in the in 1957 which is when i mean

448
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,000
 i don't know if it's actually set in 1957 it was published in 1957 and it's

449
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,240
 kind of tells of the machinations of the um

450
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,680
 English governmental class at that time um as written in a book for young boys i

451
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,720
 don't think Hugh Walters necessarily realized that

452
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,880
 he was writing for girls as well until girls started to write to him and tell

453
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,760
 him how much they liked his books after which he put more girls in

454
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,560
 so that's that's quite a good sign for the times

455
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,080
 but this one doesn't really have any it has some perfectly adequate women

456
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,040
 characters in it but it doesn't have any girls in it the

457
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,240
 main character is a boy um and it's actually much better that i

458
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,440
 remembered so i mean it's not much better than i remember because obviously i

459
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,160
 remember thinking these books were amazing

460
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,680
 um but then in retrospect i thought oh no they can't have been very good but

461
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,720
 in fact it's not bad if you like adventure stories

462
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,360
 from the 50s um and then i have a third pick which is that

463
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:02,040
 while i was sick i watched um some youtube streams of

464
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,600
 a person who's famous for being for doing sidoku on the internet

465
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,520
 instead playing through a video game called the witness and it reminded me

466
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,160
 how much i liked the witness and in fact it reminded me enough that i'm

467
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,120
 playing it again and the thing about the witnesses it tells it's a social

468
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,200
 story without using any words there are that's not

469
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,080
 quite true because there's some kind of archive

470
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,240
 recordings and videos of real people saying things real people said

471
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,640
 um but there isn't actually any words in the plot

472
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,760
 of the game so i think that's quite interesting

473
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,680
 and also it's one of the best puzzle games ever made so

474
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,040
 if you have any interest at all in puzzle games you've probably already

475
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,120
 played it um so yeah that's those nice picks those

476
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,280
 were quite quick though weren't they it's three okay if they're quick and i don't

477
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,360
 draw breath so it's hard to wear it out no so so i think and i and i have not

478
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,080
 played the witness but having heard you talk about it i might have to look it up

479
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,360
 and infinitum for a week well because it's by the chap who did braid

480
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,680
 which i quite liked it is by the chap who did braid he

481
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,840
 basically made a load of money so imagine you had made 40 million quid on braid

482
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,600
 or something like that would you then spend it all

483
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,680
 making your next game add a bit more of a size or would you go no no i need

484
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,000
 some money for my for my pension and things like that

485
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,760
 i mean you know it's art in it i mean i think the witnesses

486
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,000
 wash its face i think it did very well i'm about a quarter of the way through

487
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,120
 the witness and it's not that quick if you're rubbish at puzzle games

488
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,480
 so oh sorry it it was a quick description not a quick game it's quite a slow game

489
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,480
 unless you're simon from cracking the cryptic in which case

490
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,000
 he goes through he goes through these puzzles at a rate of knots go click click

491
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,360
 and everyone's like he's like oh i'm sorry i'm really slow i'm not good at

492
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,200
 this at all i don't really see i'm really stuck on this one i'm really really

493
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,200
 very stuck and meanwhile marks they're going and here's ten dollars from

494
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,280
 Bertie in in michigan going you're not stuck at all

495
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,760
 so i bet you're doing really well and by then he's solved it and people are like

496
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,720
 he's complaining it's slow because he's taken in five minutes and it took me

497
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,600
 three hours to solve this puzzle that's fair i can um i can get it

498
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,480
 on my mac for 35 pounds or on my ipad for nine

499
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,360
 it's i'd get it on the ipad because the entire game is about drawing

500
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,080
 lines with your finger ah you know i might get it

501
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,840
 yeah so it's lovely on the ipad it looks very pretty

502
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,400
 the graphics aren't quite as nice but but the actual how to play it

503
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,040
 is much better on the ipad okay one ground okay interesting

504
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,120
 see i have it on the playstation which is why my phone also contains for an

505
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:01,000
 example this oh yes you will need to take notes

506
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,520
 that's fair oh no but i take notes on my ipad

507
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,960
 i have to buy a new ipad yeah this is the problem okay so i take screenshots and

508
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,280
 then i open up a window with good notes and then i scribble on my good notes

509
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,120
 thing ah that's just that's just good sense that is that um

510
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:26,280
 i am i am going to put i'll send you a typical a typical screenshot

511
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,880
 for to put in the chapter as the chapter art for this

512
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,520
 thank you thank you so i will do that and apparently

513
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,680
 the witness won best iOS game of the year 2017

514
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,360
 so yeah high praise probably do we have anything else on picks

515
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,120
 out of three which i think is enough did you have a picture on what's your pick

516
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,920
 constellatheon magazine oh yeah constellatheon yes

517
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,160
 do you read them in spanish no because i am insufficiently good at

518
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,360
 spanish now i know people are going to write in and i'm

519
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,160
 very sorry people uh but i am reading the first harry potter book in spanish

520
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,480
 the reason i am doing this is not because i love transphobia

521
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,200
 i just want to get that out of the way in advance

522
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,480
 but it's basically because i am familiar enough with the harry potter story

523
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,400
 having it having been one of the formative stories of my childhood

524
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,560
 um and it is a series of novels which has been widely translated

525
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,560
 and so i was able to procure it in spanish and then i can read it

526
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,080
 and i know the story well enough that like i can

527
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:34,760
 mmm it's kind of like a safety blanket like i can understand most of the words

528
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,040
 and like if i trust myself i do understand the gist of most of what's

529
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,120
 being said although when pronouns get involved it always gets complicated

530
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,680
 uh i think this is true in any language but certainly it's the bit of spanish

531
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,720
 where i find the hardest um but it is it is really cool to be

532
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,280
 able to read in spanish and kind of just pick out the words i don't know and add

533
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,720
 them to my anki uh deck and it's it's proving

534
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,840
 quite a good way of kind of building up my confidence with

535
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,960
 interpreting written spanish um but obviously it is written at a lower level

536
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,760
 than the stories in consolatheon are because the ones in consolatheon are

537
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,160
 designed for adults and harry potter is written for 11 year olds

538
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,280
 and in spanish i am 11 i mean mentally i'm 11 as well as anyone who's

539
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,320
 witnessed me tell jokes will know but yeah in terms of reading comprehension

540
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,320
 i think harry potter is probably about my speed in spanish

541
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,240
 so so harry potter is not a bad choice for language learning generally

542
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,520
 because it's it's translated into every every language on earth practically

543
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,040
 yeah if anyone has any recommendations for um

544
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,440
 british kind of children's books that british children might have read who are

545
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,840
 my age that have been translated into spanish that do not give jk rolling

546
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,200
 money when i buy them please do write in i would be very interested

547
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,880
 or read something that was originally written in spanish

548
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,000
 but is mostly read in translation in english

549
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,680
 oh good point so yes if anyone has any recommendations for things like that

550
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,520
 please also write in turned out most of my witness screenshots

551
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,560
 were deeply spoilery which i should probably have worked at if i thought

552
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:18,600
 about it right i think we should this is not going to be on the podcast

553
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,720
 so let's finish the podcast and then you can chat

554
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,640

555
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,680
 the podcast is there anything we're looking forward to in the next

00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:40,360
 hey what on this that was the 41st episode of the octa thought podcast

560
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:19,480

00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,720

565
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,000
