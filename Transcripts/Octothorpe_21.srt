1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 We've waffled up for ages.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,620
 We have here I go have to please edit this down to something crisp and cogent John

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,120
 Deep and crisp and even

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,960
 Hahahaha, yes

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,520
 Hello everyone and welcome to the

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,520
 21st episode of octa thought the podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom. I'm Joel Coxon

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,040
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and it's a special Christmas episode

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,620
 Yay

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,900
 Because you will be hearing this if you download it on Christmas Eve you will and

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,760
 Christmas is you know the most marvelous time of the year the time when

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,760
 families come together when people party every night for months when you

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,600
 Hit up everybody you know no never mind

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,120
 Where we sit alone in our houses

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,320
 Saying it'll be we'll have Christmas in summer like the Australians as they actually said on the radio this morning

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,480
 We won't and it won't be and I having talked to a lot of Australians this week about the classic Australia Christmas

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,480
 I'm pretty sure it's a bit shit

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:23,800
 They're kind of like oh we have roast turkey and all the trimmings and it doesn't really suit the fact that it's 93 degrees outside

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,640
 But there you go. You step up. They have a barbecue, right?

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,400
 I mean I actually went to a Christmas party

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,800
 But there's nothing that puts it down on your Christmas party quite like a news alert saying there are

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,160
 546 cases of covid just discovered

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,640
 To make you think well, it's probably good job. I went to this Christmas party because I might be another one

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,440
 Anyway, we had some we had two letters of comment

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,240
 We had one from Peter Sullivan who sent us a

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,400
 An editorial he'd written for his zine

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,920
 and

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,360
 Talked a little bit about online conventions and things and and kind of was

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,840
 Inspired I think by punctuation what we ran with Steve Davis. Hi, Steve

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:16,160
 And yeah, it's quite good. So there is a link to it in the show notes because it is available on the Internet in his

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
 zine

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,960
 So yes, everyone go and read that if you'd like and thank you for getting in touch Peter

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,320
 And yeah, he does say some some nice things about punctuation. So thank you very much

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,840
 We are glad you had a nice time

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,160
 And then the other letter of comment we had was from Claire Breyerley of Croydon

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 and

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,200
 So I should note before I read the letter of comment that Claire sent me a text message yesterday saying that the package

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,760
 She sent me was finally on the move and I could expect it

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,240
 hopefully before Christmas perhaps just after and

39
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,600
 I said that I didn't know whether to be excited or terrified and she said possibly both for various reasons

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:02,600
 So, you know, I don't know what's coming and she did all I know is that it's something that she hopes will be intact

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,200
 And that did not make me less terrified

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,680
 Because I don't know what my guess is a sculpture made of weeabicks. I

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,080
 Mean I know you said please don't send you anymore

44
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,240
 Please stop sending us a week because you've got too many me to fix but Claire has correctly pointed out

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,400
 This was only a month after you told people to send you as much be too big as possible

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
 So you could roll around in a massive bathtub full of we to bigs

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,120
 So really if it is an elaborate we to big sculpture, I think it is no more than you deserve

48
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:39,920
 Yep, that's me told

49
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,080
 Claire also takes us to task for having carefully

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,720
 After she had carefully said two versions of her previous lock

51
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
 the second one amended

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,460
 John read out the first one and Liz and I are blaming John. That's fair. I take full responsibility

53
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,040
 class says I'm writing a lock

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,480
 I'm checking it twice and then a dozen times because I'm now paranoid

55
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,280
 I've made a mistake that won't get corrected by the podcast

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,160
 well

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,880
 Yes, I apologize

58
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,360
 I I would say that I'll update the version in last episode show notes to be the correct version

59
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,960
 But I will probably forget so I'm not gonna say that but I just have

60
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,240
 Yeah, we're not really that kind of error checking fact-checking kind of operation, are we?

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,360
 Perhaps not

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,880
 We did cut we did go away into our homework

63
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,400
 We did well. I did a fanzine

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,740
 The fanzines motto was never ix to play never apologize. So there's that

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
 Claire also notes that

66
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,040
 Mark came up with a version of that Christmas song

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:58,800
 Many years ago about Claire about Claire which goes she's making a list and then another list and yet another list

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,960
 That's a list of all the lists and that does seem very organized. I have not got any Christmas lists yet

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,560
 Except for mine with presents on it. Hopefully everyone buys me presents. Yeah presents

70
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,300
 I haven't bought anybody any presents. It's a real problem. Everyone's getting a little note in their card saying

71
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,440
 Whoops bit of a cock up on the present front. That's still a reference that you guys aren't going to get

72
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,600
 But thank you for your letter of comment Claire

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,940
 last episode we have some hot takes on the

74
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,040
 Hugo award for best interactive experience, which is something that has been

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,960
 promoted and proposed by our ira Alexandre

76
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:48,800
 And we we have not read the 40,000 word report that accompanied the proposal and so we were coming from a place of

77
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:57,240
 What we reckoned in the true Michelin web style and I will put a link to that sketch in the show notes

78
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,400
 But now we've read it

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,320
 Well, I think to be fair to us

80
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,760
 We were actually bouncing off

81
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,680
 Discons announcement of the best video game Hugo, which now I have read the full

82
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,640
 Proposal for the best interactive video game. No best interactive experience of video game Hugo

83
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,960
 They're not the same actually

84
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,080
 So I thought it was interesting that

85
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,040
 Discons had chosen to implement this and I presume that part of it was because there was quite a lot of

86
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,280
 general debate and discussion over having a Hugo for best interactive experience of video game

87
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,440
 But they've chosen to implement it in a different way

88
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,960
 And I'm not sure we've actually seen what their definition of video game is going to be

89
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,800
 Because it's a special Hugo so you don't have to have it in the Constitution yet

90
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,440
 So I'll be interested to see where they differ

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,120
 Yes, so this I think this I think is a very good point that we would discuss you before the show

92
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,960
 And I think I think having read the

93
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,880
 DC nomination, I think several of the criticisms we were applying that are not

94
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,840
 Problems with the award as Ida Alexandre has proposed it

95
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,000
 I think are more of a problem with the way that DC has proposed theirs and

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
 I think that is an interesting choice

97
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,960
 Because I think it's difficult if if someone has if someone has kind of proposed a category and has done an awful lot of work to

98
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,120
 Demonstrate why it would be viable and why a lot of criticisms are not a valid then introducing a test category

99
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,360
 Which is slightly different is very unhelpful

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,880
 In some ways and because if it works great, but if it doesn't work

101
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,560
 It'll be very difficult to disentangle the extent to which it didn't work because DC changed it

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,440
 Versus the extent to which it didn't work because it was inherently unworkable

103
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,200
 Yeah, I'm just gonna fact check myself because

104
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,760
 Live fact checking on the podcast because having said I don't think I've seen discons full proposal

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,760
 I have realized this could have got the full proposal and wording out there. I think it's interesting in the

106
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:09,280
 Yeah, a gate so the defineer game is a work-wearing player choice interaction or participation significantly interacts the narrative play meaning or experience and the game is available on personal computers

107
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,240
 Basically phones

108
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,640
 PlayStation or Xbox so I mean it would definitely be possible to interpret that as saying that in their definition of

109
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,440
 game they have included say

110
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,400
 Black Mirror Bandersnatch which I watched through the Netflix app on my PlayStation for instance

111
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,520
 So it might be that in trying to limit it they have inadvertently

112
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,440
 Included a lot of stuff that would be in the best interactive experience or or game Hugo anyway

113
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,940
 Hmm and also given how many of us have been playing

114
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,080
 tabletop games but fire out outlets like tabletop simulator or

115
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,440
 Tabletopia then in a way they they would also count

116
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,880
 Yeah, they would like tabletop simulator

117
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,000
 is available on personal computers and

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,400
 Any more to written for that I would argue is a substantial modification of tabletop simulator

119
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,360
 And so I don't really understand if what they want to do is limited to video games the way they've written this

120
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,320
 spectacularly does not do that and I don't understand why they wanted to limit it to video games given that I think the original

121
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,640
 Rose was a lot more elegant. So I think I agree with you on that I

122
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,600
 Have been thinking about

123
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,680
 interactive experiences because I suppose they do mean things like Bandersnatch

124
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,140
 but I

125
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:39,020
 Was thinking well, what are the interactive experiences that might be relevant and it struck me that things like?

126
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,340
 Secret cinema which have nothing to do with things that you do on a computer

127
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:52,020
 Are the sorts of things that feel like interactive experiences that that might come within a broad scope

128
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
 I I don't like

129
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:00,940
 The idea that you're going to have proposals that say you that talk about the way you engage

130
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,820
 With the material. It's a bit like saying that novels only count if they're on paper

131
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:13,340
 Which of course we did have with with certainly with the fan categories for for some time and and I

132
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:19,420
 It all seems quite complicated and I'm interested in seeing how it comes out. I did I

133
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,500
 Did feel that the 40,000 word document went some way to answering my

134
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,140
 concerns, but also that

135
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:36,100
 It's response too. Well, nobody can afford to play all the triple A games was oh

136
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,660
 but

137
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,860
 half the things that come through as best games of the year and not triple A games the other half still are and

138
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,100
 and

139
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,940
 You can you can go and watch let's plays, but let's plays are I think by their definition?

140
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,380
 non-interactive experiences

141
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:01,180
 So I am not completely I'm not completely convinced that my concerns here were answered

142
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,500
 but obviously what we're gonna see is the

143
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,260
 category shaking down when the Hugo voters get to have a go at it and

144
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,340
 The I would have thought that the Hugo nominators and voters are quite clever at

145
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,340
 Actually making sensible choices and all of these things and we've seen that in lots of other categories

146
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,460
 Yes, so I was just gonna say that you mentioned

147
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,060
 secret cinema whereas in fact

148
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:29,620
 I think more maybe more even more relevant to that is the one they do mention in in the document

149
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,900
 Which is they pull out sleep no more the interactive punch-drunk theater experience based on Macbeth

150
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,740
 And I hadn't seen that but I have seen the drowned man, which is an interactive

151
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,300
 Adaptation they did over the post office old sorting office in Paddington

152
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,980
 Where you know you're all you're all masked up and you get to choose which bits of the story you follow and

153
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,220
 Everyone who does it will have a slightly different experience and some people will have experiences that aren't possible for other people to have

154
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,460
 That feels very much like the sort of interactive experience that would be in here

155
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,660
 I'm not I've not been to any secret cinema things because they're really expensive. So I'm not sure how they

156
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,740
 Compared to that the discom three definition of the category is a

157
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:20,300
 game or modification of a game first released to the public in the last year and they define game as a

158
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,300
 Work here with we're in player choice inter-sectional participation significantly impacts the narrative play meaning or experience

159
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,940
 I am not convinced that secret Santa does have a secret Santa

160
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:39,620
 I'm not convinced that secret cinema has that feature because at the end of the day you are watching the film and the film will be the same

161
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:47,340
 Regardless of how people into engage with it in the cinema. So I don't think my understanding is not that secret cinema would qualify

162
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:55,780
 Unless secret cinema does show films like clue where the endings are different and the audience has a meaningful chance of impacting them

163
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,780
 But that is not the impression I've had

164
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:03,180
 the the watching a film bit of secret cinema has been getting us

165
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:10,620
 Becoming a smaller and smaller portion of the overall experience over time. It's the experience that's interactive

166
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,260
 And the film is one part of that and I haven't been to secret cinema either

167
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,300
 So obviously I'm slightly talking from talking rot here

168
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,620
 But you know I've talked a lot to people who have so none of us have done our homework on this one

169
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,060
 But I hope it would have been expensive. Well, we didn't in our defense. Alison has only just mentioned this

170
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,020
 But the other thing I will say is that

171
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,180
 But the other thing you said was about how you were uncomfortable with

172
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,660
 Splitting this off in terms of how you engage with the work

173
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:47,100
 Because obviously the category basically in in the in the games you go proposal

174
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:54,860
 It defines what an interactive work is and then it explicitly disqualifies interactive works from being nominated from other categories

175
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,060
 And introduces a new category for which they can be nominated

176
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,420
 And I don't think I see your point about how it's a bit like mandating that a novel has to be on paper

177
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,900
 But I think that the argument that the panel make is that

178
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,300
 Interactivity does fundamentally

179
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,980
 offer a different narrative experience to more linear

180
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,460
 forms storytelling like best dramatic presentation or best novel and so it is necessary to

181
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,540
 split that off

182
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,860
 Sorry, that's not the distinction the distinction I was making was between board games and video games

183
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,020
 I I think it is or you know, I feel like a fighting fantasy book is

184
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:43,220
 The same is inherently the same the same sort of experience as the fighting fantasy video game

185
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,940
 played on the iPad and

186
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,020
 I think I'll defend to the death that they should be in the same Hugo category

187
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,380
 And there is not a Hugo category for games that are not played on computers

188
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,740
 Yes, no, I agree with that

189
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,820
 So why why have they eliminated why have they said oh, it has to be on a computer to count

190
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,900
 I'm gonna let Liz come in after I've said this. Sorry Liz. I

191
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,100
 Think so my take is I agree. I think board games should absolutely be in this category

192
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:19,060
 My suspicion is that it will be a bit like short films in best dramatic presentation short form where they're technically eligible

193
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,380
 But they never get nominated because TV shows dominate

194
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,220
 I suspect the same thing will happen here which one which I will be grumpy about when it does if it inevitably happen

195
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,500
 But I do think you are right that they should be eligible even if the electorate does not end up nominating them

196
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,140
 Yeah, I think I feel I mean

197
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:41,020
 I'm basically willing to give them lots of leeway because this is a temporary Hugo category that can then be refined over time

198
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:48,020
 I find a bit weird to have a category that sort of defines all the different ways it can be experienced

199
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:54,020
 To the exclusion of some things that you think would fit. I'm also not sure if

200
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,460
 Including board games would mean that board games don't get nominated because I actually think that

201
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:06,180
 With some of the board games that do become very popular they might get played more widely than some of the video games

202
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,780
 Like I think if you were doing this, I'm just thinking of

203
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,660
 Wingspan which was board game came out in 2019 and I think

204
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:20,020
 Basically a very large number of board game fans probably played quite soon after it came out and so you might see that

205
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,060
 Popping up if that had been eligible

206
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:30,000
 In a way that you might not for all the different AA games for instance because I do think people might play those a little bit

207
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
 behind times

208
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,720
 Um, so I also point is if you're gonna have like a game or a substantial modification of a game and that would be board games

209
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,120
 Then john do you realize it means you could nominate? I'll come horror the card game basically for a Hugo in perpetuity

210
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,400
 John is nodding. I know I am aware

211
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,560
 I think we should get on to suggested nominations shortly

212
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,760
 So, um one thing I will say before we before I think we should come back to this before I do

213
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,560
 What to remember to say is this is how I nominate best pro artist

214
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,120
 I go through the card games. I play looking at my favorite card art and then I nominate the artists on those cards

215
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,600
 Because they're all eligible eligible

216
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,200
 This is kind of like I like to burn fibers and throw them into the sea

217
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,640
 Right that would be eco destructive and I will have no part of it

218
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,920
 I said to buy favors to companies that manufacture things in China and that is much better for the environment

219
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,600
 Oh god, no, that's kind of like me and my quest to nominate video games in best romantic presentation long form for a long time

220
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,160
 Which yeah, it's like completely futile. I

221
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,200
 Think one thing I will say is that listener, um if you are listening to this and thinking hang on

222
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,240
 They mentioned that this report is 40,000 words. Did they read a 40,000 word report? I feel so special

223
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,240
 Uh, we did not it sends out if you download the report, which is a horribly formatted, uh, google doc

224
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,720
 um for some reason

225
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
 the

226
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,560
 Main meat of the report is basically you could be the abstract the introduction the conclusion and like tip bits of the bits in between

227
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,000
 And I do think that in general it would have been better structured as a much turdsir report

228
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,680
 With a larger number of appendices to make it clear that that is really how you can read it

229
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,400
 See I think it would have been much better if it had been constructed as a choose your own adventure report

230
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,400
 Where instead of having to reach the whole thing all the way through it would say

231
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
 If you are interested in

232
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,480
 Why we don't think why we think it doesn't matter that nobody could play all the triple a games click here

233
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,240
 if you think

234
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,440
 It when we're not giving enough credence to other sorts of interactive experience click here

235
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,240
 If you wonder why board games aren't included

236
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,440
 Um click here, but we haven't actually covered that

237
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,800
 What they should have done is structured it as a choose your own adventure at the business meeting

238
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,560
 If you would like to raise an objection along the lines of this turn to page 27

239
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,720
 And when you turn to page 27

240
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:06,480
 When you turn to page 27, you discover a giant ice ball and unless you can roll 11 on one die

241
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,320
 You're not getting through his name's kevin

242
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,920
 Oh my god

243
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,720
 I want to win so this category oh shoot i've left it too late if

244
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,680
 I we've left it so we have as it turns out 11 days to write this so it is eligible for the hugo

245
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,160
 Which we currently discussing?

246
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,960
 If we could do it in the next 11 days

247
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,960
 So if you would like octa thought to be an interactive experience

248
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,840
 Please go to episode 13

249
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,680
 Uh, I suppose wait a couple of ways we could go in this

250
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,040
 um

251
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,040
 I will mention that one thing I was quite pleased with is part of the argument for why we need a video game hugo

252
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,400
 Specifically is that worldcons have had increasing amounts of game related program

253
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,280
 And I will note that this peaked in 2014

254
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:08,560
 Um the fact that I was involved and we had estimate calum steward's involved and I guess we also had allysan involved since we put a big

255
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
 Games tent in your space

256
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,360
 Uh

257
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,720
 May not be coincidental to why there are so many so many games items

258
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,960
 Which I actively encouraged I should say yes, you were very pleased to put the big be a big tent in your space

259
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,640
 And and steve jaxson was there and oh yeah, it was cool

260
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:32,240
 So it yeah, it was good and I if that means people think actually there's more appetite for video game hugo than there would have been

261
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,520
 Uh into 2006 because more people now see that are worldcons and people associated with games feel that will cons and more they think then i'm

262
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,080
 pleased to have played a tiny part in that and I should say this is a good point to plug

263
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
 the

264
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,480
 2014

265
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
 2014

266
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,920
 The glass go in 2024 worldconbid which is of course chaired by the aforementioned estera calum steward

267
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,280
 And which i'm now actually a member of the bid team. So yeah, go go gosh go

268
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:08,320
 um for no doubt good content related to video games and interactive experiences

269
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,080
 Is that so I must admit I skipped past some of the graphs

270
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:20,080
 But does that mean that dublin 2019 with steve jaxson as a guest of hoda had less game related programming than loncon 3 that had no

271
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,800
 Game related guest of hobbler and then so the caveat to that is that there is I think there are some game related program items that they probably

272
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,120
 Couldn't track specifically in uh, I think

273
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,480
 Some of the later ones because they were running there like uh

274
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,600
 Interactive sessions and sign up through a different system and they may not have captured all the game sessions that were running

275
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,760
 It may also be that we had things technically tagged as gaming sessions

276
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,560
 You know, we may have had more things saying okay. This is a formal to our gaming session in the games tent

277
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,160
 That didn't get into the program for other years. So i'm not sure we actually had more than 2019

278
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,680
 Okay

279
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,400
 I think it's also true though that there is more gaming at

280
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,680
 London and dublin and health sinky than at the us worldcons where

281
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,920
 You you us worldcon attendance is more homogenous

282
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,640
 It's more geared towards older

283
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,720
 Literary science fiction fans than european worldcons are

284
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,840
 I think it's true, but they do say the same thing was probably true for 2018 in that they're not sure they've managed to track all the game sessions

285
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,040
 so

286
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,840
 28 being also made of an outlier. I don't know if there wasn't there

287
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,760
 But this this you go. I mean it might end up being going to a game that's just good to play

288
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,080
 But I think it's going to go to a game with strong narrative. I think there's a

289
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,040
 Real push in what it's talking about and why it thinks it's appropriate for a hugo

290
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,600
 that actually

291
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
 the hugos are the awards for

292
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,240
 You know our specular to fiction genre and and the argument for having a

293
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,360
 award for video game or interactive experience is because of the

294
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,080
 Because it is a way in which stories of specular to fiction are told

295
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,720
 and I'm I'm not

296
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,800
 You know, I although it's perfectly possible that that the hugo would be won by tetris or some 2020 equivalent of tetris

297
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,880
 It feels to me remarkably unlikely that that will happen

298
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,640
 And that there is going to be something there that's about the world building or the narrative or something

299
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,120
 that is beyond just

300
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,520
 Fun play and some of what is going on in gaming tensack conventions

301
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,560
 I would argue is just having fun playing games without building a deep and consistent and coherent narrative

302
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,320
 Yeah, we don't have a hugo for best bar is what i'm saying

303
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,400
 We should do obviously and the campaign starts here

304
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,080
 Yes, um, I I think there are two things I really liked about this

305
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
 proposal

306
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,560
 Which is firstly the way that it uses

307
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,440
 The way that it points out that the hugo award is the way that was first recognizes

308
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,240
 What's happening in specular to fiction that is worthy of recognition and that

309
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,240
 They make the point that was first as a membership is interested in games and that games form at this point a significant and

310
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,120
 Big part of what was first considered to be specular to fiction and the way they approach that is kind of demonstrating that that is being discussed at world cons and things like that

311
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,320
 But also

312
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,760
 Discussing in terms of these are people who we know are in wusfus and they are talking about some making games

313
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,280
 So like nk jemisin and mirlafeteer two of the people that are specifically called out in the report

314
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,040
 The other thing I like is that there is a mention in the report

315
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,040
 of a collaborative role-playing game

316
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,760
 which they kind of use to

317
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
 call attention specifically to

318
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,480
 um the idea of

319
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,200
 collaborative and interactive world building and using that as a way of forming a narrative and the game that they

320
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,360
 Highlight is a game called microscope, which I now really want to play

321
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,680
 Um, but there's a really interesting section called interactive world building in the report

322
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,360
 They also mentioned dwarf fortress, which I think is a

323
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,000
 remarkable

324
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,560
 Remarkable game of building building things out of stuff that doesn't doesn't exist before you stop playing the game

325
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:31,200
 I read an article by the lead designer of arkham per other card game, which is long-time listeners may know i'm a huge stan of

326
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,320
 And and the lead designer mj wrote a blog post in which they discuss

327
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:43,840
 The interaction of narrative and ludonarrative and i've not heard the term ludonarrative before but ludonarrative is the

328
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,760
 emergent narrative you get from playing the game versus the narrative which is dictated by

329
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:57,600
 The narrative that has been written for the game and and they talked a little bit about the importance of the interplay between those two concepts in

330
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
 Well

331
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 Explicitly in board games in in their example, but I think the same applies to video games

332
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,600
 And I will post that link in the show notes because I think that is also a very interesting thing to think about when you're thinking about

333
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,800
 Why this hugo would allow you to recognize forms of storytelling that the rest of the hugos don't currently

334
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,360
 recognize

335
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,160
 I think this is probably a point that is made in the

336
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,040
 in the report, but the we use the hugos as a way of the

337
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,200
 community not merely by the award, but also in what is nominated

338
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,040
 surfacing what is good and what is worthy of our attention and

339
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,520
 it feels like

340
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,000
 Games as the largest entertainment genre are clearly worthy of our attention in terms of the money we spend on them

341
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,360
 And it seems it seems likely that science fiction fans are spending at least as much money on

342
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,160
 on games as everybody else does that they are a big part of our entertainment life

343
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,600
 and

344
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,040
 It seems it feels to me that there is an argument that the that the community should be starting to

345
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,840
 Build this consensus of what is good

346
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,200
 I would add that actually thinking of it in terms of narrative

347
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:19,680
 Helps with one of my small problems with it, which is that because interactive experience or game covers such a wide range of things

348
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,080
 And you could be asked to judge a shortlist, which is

349
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,720
 you know an interactive

350
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,280
 essentially an interactive TV show or

351
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,000
 You know a video game

352
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,160
 That's sort of an indie narrative game versus maybe a more traditional a game and rpg versus

353
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,400
 You know a load of different board games

354
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,360
 Just you can be asked to judge between lots of different things in a way that you maybe don't in most categories

355
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,080
 Part of the best related work where we just throw everything in

356
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,920
 Yeah, they're really more different than out were at answer ball and at world 71

357
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,720
 You know what 72 a what sorry?

358
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,320
 I don't know what at world 72 is Alison

359
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,560
 Um, it's a massive massive labor of love

360
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,000
 um compilation of fanzine that has just appeared

361
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,640
 It would help if you could use references that people who were born after 1984 you've might know

362
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,360
 It's a new fan scene

363
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,040
 How is it it would help if you could use references that people who were born before 2000 might know

364
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:30,880
 Basically Alison my experiences are the default of I resent any implication that they are not hashtag ybell privilege

365
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,000
 I don't think it's unreasonable to okay, so so

366
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,040
 All of our categories do actually have things that are very different in them

367
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,360
 And when it starts to become too much of a problem the solution is to split the category

368
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:51,040
 I I I I think we I mean we do and we do manage to give awards in best related work, which work more or less

369
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,520
 Uh

370
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,680
 Maybe we should save that for a different

371
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,320
 Yeah, uh different podcast

372
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,520
 one of the points the um report makes and and one of the things I think Alison highlighted a potential pit for last episode

373
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:13,920
 Was that you might end up getting an enormous number of games nominated in such a way that you wouldn't end up with a kind of coherent

374
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,960
 Shortlist that the that the nominators had settled on

375
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,480
 Um, the report kind of highlights that in any given year

376
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,240
 There are roughly 20 games that tend to get put forward to awards

377
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,640
 And they tended to each get nominated for sort of two or three awards out of the big

378
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,680
 Four or five awards the report highlights and it makes the argument that based on how that clustering works in other award

379
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,040
 Categories it is likely that a similar thing would apply

380
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,240
 Um for the hugos and I thought that was quite well argued

381
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,600
 So I think I think they do highlight that

382
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,320
 But you know, yes, there's the so take like

383
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:56,480
 So take like 2017 where you could end up with a plausible shortlist that was horizon zero dawn, which is a fairly traditional aa

384
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,480
 RPG

385
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,560
 Versus super Mario Odyssey, which has a completely different kind of narrative while also being an aa game

386
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,120
 Versus monument valley, which is a little indie game

387
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,240
 Versus gloom haven the giant kind of

388
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,280
 RPG board game versus

389
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,640
 Well a whole other range of stuff basically, but you could you could end up with something that contains quite a

390
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,440
 Wide range of different experiences and to me thinking of that as in well

391
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,640
 I'm not really trying to assess them based on every different criteria

392
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,360
 But if I'm trying to assess them based on what I think gives me the

393
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,800
 best science fiction or fantasy like narrative experience and that makes that

394
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,440
 I think comparison a bit easier

395
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,000
 I mean, it's easy anyway because obviously in 2017 I would give it to horizon zero dawn

396
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,920
 But I shouldn't it was a different year where there wasn't like something super amazing on the shortlist

397
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,960
 Yeah, they do all seem like games though

398
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,920
 Yes, they do all seem like games that is a very good point

399
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,640
 But as you will know this I'm a huge horizon zero dawn stan

400
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,240
 But what I don't have is a horizon zero dawn t-shirt and I do have a monument valley t-shirt

401
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,320
 Monument valley was a phenomenal game and if if anyone listening hasn't played it

402
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,680
 I strongly recommend giving it a look because it was fantastic

403
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:16,400
 Yeah, I thought I thought monument valley was a bit really and I I kind of feel

404
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,160
 Very well. It was a good run. We made it to the end of 2020

405
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,520
 This is the last episode of the podcast everyone pack up

406
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,000
 Okay, I will I will say what I thought was wrong with monument valley

407
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,960
 Which is that I have probably played too many puzzles for it

408
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,760
 Because I didn't I had not realized there was a puzzle element in this game

409
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,760
 I just played it through and then it finished and it was like, oh, were there puzzles

410
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,040
 Right, okay. I could see I could see I could see that

411
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,560
 And and I I feel like a game like monument valley could have worked for me

412
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,720
 But it it didn't because although yes, there was points where you had to think about for a minute about what you might do next

413
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,200
 It didn't really

414
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,120
 So you can actually you can actually fail to get the experience you're supposed to get out of something

415
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,920
 For a reason that's got nothing to do

416
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,560
 That's probably true of novels as well because there are lots of novels people like that I think are kind of

417
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,720
 on rails

418
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,880
 No, I think that's true. I think that's true of any medium, right? Like if you

419
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,680
 like I'm trying to think of an example like if you're a

420
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,640
 there will be

421
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,760
 tropes

422
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,280
 for instance in tv and film that if you're less familiar with you will find them into playing a certain way in a

423
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,080
 In a film or tv show and you'll find that really interesting

424
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,760
 But someone who's already seen that kind of interplay done better somewhere else might find it kind of all that and I thought that kind of

425
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:48,080
 Maybe gets a little bit of what you're saying like and I will say like I would I if for eyes a zero dawn

426
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,360
 I never want to hugo. I would be at 100% on board with that because I

427
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,960
 Good can you get it from my pad?

428
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,520
 Oh

429
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,400
 PlayStation 4 exclusive. Oh am PC, but that seems less helpful to you

430
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,560
 I'll be able to get a PlayStation 4 one day very cheaply won't I?

431
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,960
 Okay, well, where do I get my ps5? I'll probably lend you by ps4

432
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
 I like a lend you horizons are adorn because I've got it

433
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,480
 Um, so yes, it's bany also loves it. She'll ban me up that is good. Um

434
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,920
 And the next one set in san francisco, sorry I could talk about horizons are adorn for a long time. We should move on

435
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,480
 But I think that sample

436
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,120
 Shortlist does give you a really good idea and I'm like because I've not played much glume haven but I've played like probably

437
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,520
 Enough to know where I would rank it on that list

438
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,120
 I haven't finished glume haven because it is a game that would require hundreds of hours

439
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,280
 Uh in order to finish

440
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
 and like, you know

441
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:52,080
 But I think they I think you're right that like the fact that you can focus on the narrative does mean that they can be directly compared

442
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,880
 Which is really good and as i listen says they are all they all they all seem like games, which is good

443
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,560
 Yeah, and I will concede that while I think this is uh, maybe a wider spread of things to compare than you might get in in best

444
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,360
 Novel it's probably no wider selection of things than you do getting some of the other categories

445
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,760
 You because you could get extremely different things same you could get in best dramatic presentation short form a five-minute

446
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,440
 Short versus a 30-minute documentary versus a one-hour

447
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,680
 episode of dramatic television as part of a series and we still happily ask people to compare those so

448
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,560
 I guess it's not outside what we do anyway

449
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,800
 It makes more sense than trying to nominate games in best related work or

450
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,840
 Best dramatic presentation because I do think they are

451
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,840
 Too much like I think nominating clipping in dramatic presentation made a lot of sense

452
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,200
 And I think in some ways that shares things in common with things it was up against

453
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,160
 I mean despite that i'm still not sure it's an ideal fit

454
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,240
 I can see how it how you can compare it to other things with a game

455
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,760
 It's like well, how do I decide where the glume haven is better than dr. Who like a what?

456
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,080
 on what

457
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,320
 Metric would I try and make that decision whereas glume haven versus maria wardesee seems like a much

458
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,520
 Easier thing to do despite the fact they're still very different

459
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,200
 I believe the rubric for hugo awards is something like

460
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,320
 um, you're invited to vote for the things you most enjoyed during the year

461
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,080
 Yes

462
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,720
 And I will say i've played a lot of glume haven and I think it's only okay

463
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,120
 But don't tell anyone because i'll be thrown out of the board gaming fandom

464
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,080
 Yeah, we better not say that on the internet now do anything

465
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,320
 but I will say um

466
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,200
 My

467
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,240
 Tastes in board games are weird and should not I do not pretend that they are in any way representative of wider board game fandom

468
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,920
 Because glume haven is currently the top rated game or board game geek by a significant chunk and

469
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,320
 Yeah, fine. So we should actually say so given 2020 being playing games

470
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,600
 Um, what do we think we should nominate?

471
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,080
 Because I think I think it's obvious what's going to win and I don't think you're gonna like it

472
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:11,760
 It's going to be animal crossing new horizons, right? It is going to be animal crossing new horizons. What do you think? Yes

473
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,640
 Okay, okay, okay

474
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,360
 I think it is going to get the overwhelmingly largest number of nominations and then I think it's going to win

475
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,440
 And it has and I don't think it has very much of the sort of deep narrative

476
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
 We've been talking about

477
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,080
 No, me neither. That's why I have a bit surprised by that pick

478
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:37,600
 Which in fact is what stopped me playing it because I basically went oh, this is pathetic waste of time and honestly I should just grow plants in my garden

479
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,840
 I didn't do that either

480
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:46,320
 It is a lot of fun. It is lovely any any suggestion that

481
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,720
 That it's a waste of time. It was very good, especially when I was using it as a form of

482
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,600
 bonding experience with my family members

483
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,040
 Um, but what I will say is that I played the original animal crossing on game cube

484
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,520
 Uh, and what I

485
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,240
 Found was that it felt an awful lot like

486
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,200
 Every so often you come across especially on mobile you come across games where you play them so you can play them and there's no

487
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,400
 um

488
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,000
 There's no

489
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,320
 kind of goal other than the more you play them the more you're allowed to play them and so there's like

490
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,600
 A good example of this. They used to play Star Wars command where you play it and you unlock things that mean that you

491
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,160
 Um have to spend more time doing things, but the things you unlock

492
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,120
 Um means that you can do the things that take longer quicker

493
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,920
 And then you can use that to get more points

494
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,200
 And then the points you add a lot more things and the cycle just repeats infinitely until you decide to stop playing and

495
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:48,080
 The experience I had on game cube and the experience I've kind of sussed out from watching the discussion about the switch version

496
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,360
 Makes me feel awful lot like it's like that and I

497
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,640
 Fundamentally don't really understand the appeal

498
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,240
 Um, but a lot of people do love it and as I said, I am a ramen so there is that

499
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,720
 I mean i haven't played it because i don't want to switch

500
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,280
 What?

501
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,640
 But I mean I did play a lot of stardew valley which seems like a pretty similar sort of concept

502
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,520
 And I enjoyed growing a lot of vegetables and so on

503
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,920
 I think stardew valley might have a little bit more narrative because you do have like

504
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,200
 uh the narrative in the you know your

505
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,520
 Relationships with the other villages that you can kind of unlock as you go through definitely not a 2020 game there

506
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,640
 No, it's definitely not a 2020 game. I'm just saying that's the nearest

507
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:36,720
 Comparison so so other 2020 games guys. Well, that's the thing is I was looking at all these, you know lists of best games 2020

508
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,080
 They came out. I think I have played one game which came out in 2020. So that's really not very helpful

509
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,640
 and and that game is um

510
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
 Fall guys ultimate knockout which

511
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,640
 Also doesn't have any narrative unless the narrative is that I put on a horse's head

512
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,240
 On my little wobbly guy and ran around but that's not really narrative

513
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,360
 So I think there's lots of things I could say might be candidates for game of the year

514
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,120
 um

515
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,920
 Like probably the last of us part two which I haven't played because I got stuck in the last first part one and it's too hard

516
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,240
 As another assassin's creed game. There's a half-life game. There's cyberpunk 2077

517
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,960
 If you have a computer that will actually play it, but I haven't actually played any of these games. So

518
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,040
 I am told Hades is very good and I should play it

519
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,560
 Oh, yes, that's the other one, but yeah again. I

520
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,920
 I don't I'm a bit limited to gaming devices to

521
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,720
 phone and ipad and

522
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,480
 PlayStation so

523
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
 John have you played any games 2020?

524
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,080
 Basically, I'm trying to work out how you can get board game geek to show you games that came out in 2020

525
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,880
 I can tell you for free that I have not played any video games that came out in 2020. Um, I just looked

526
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,480
 Oh, I was thinking of things that would actually be eligible for this year's hugo, which means it has to be

527
00:39:52,480 --> 00:40:00,800
 A video game. Oh, no, I think and this and this draws me neatly onto why I think this is a terrible idea because I think the the

528
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,160
 um

529
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,560
 The hugo as suggested by our ira

530
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,600
 Alexander day is a great thing. I would enthusiastically join in with the dc announcement of the hugo

531
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,320
 They have decided to trial. I cannot nominate anything for and I think those are

532
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,720
 different enough takes on the two suggestions that I am skeptical that the dc one will

533
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:29,280
 Adequately stress test this from my perspective because I just think my interests are so much more in the tabletop direction than in the video game

534
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,000
 Um direction, but the most recent two games I have played are pokemon sword

535
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,680
 Which was 2019 and jennifer on order which was 2019. Um, so I have not as far as I know played any 2020 games

536
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,280
 I think it is did did you not play star wars quadrants?

537
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,160
 Uh, I played it for like two hours, but yes technically I did

538
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,760
 Um, and I could probably nominate that but it wouldn't be because I

539
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,440
 Had thought about all the games in 2020. I had played and decided that that one was good. It would be because

540
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,680
 It's not because you like it. I have opinions on board games in 2020 though

541
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,080
 So, you know if they ever announce a board game you go come back to me

542
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,080
 Well, what what would be for your nominations for board game in 2020?

543
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,840
 um, so um in 2020 there is a

544
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,320
 board game that was released called the search for planet x which I really enjoy

545
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,320
 Shut up and sit down reviewed it and my friend bought it for me for my birthday

546
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:29,680
 And um, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing that. It's kind of a logical deduction game where you play astronomers

547
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,240
 Um, and I was initially like oh god. This is good. A ui day job, but a board game

548
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,000
 How am I gonna find this leisurely or relaxing?

549
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,720
 But it turns out it's really good because um, the way you publish papers is really nice at like there are so many

550
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,080
 Interesting little ways in which the mechanics really neatly fit how astronomy works in real life

551
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,240
 Um, and yeah, I really really enjoy it. It's a bit like a more complex version of cluedo

552
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,000
 almost

553
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 um in that

554
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,240
 It's a logical deduction game, but it's not as luck based as cluedo and it is more space themed

555
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,200
 So it is in two ways much more up my alley

556
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,640
 Um, the other one I've really been enjoying it will not surprise anyone to learn is that I have bought the arkam horror expansion

557
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,880
 the insmith conspiracy and

558
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:28,240
 My wife and I have been playing through and it is I thought the last arkam horror expansion was okay like obviously

559
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,960
 They're just staying for the fact I'm a huge fan of arkam horror and just comparing its other arkam horror products

560
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,800
 I thought it was fine. Um, this one I am really enjoying and I think it might be my favorite campaign that I've made so far

561
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,960
 So like I've also been hugely enjoyed that so those would be by two picks if I was going to nominate board game based things

562
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,440
 Um, and then I was trying to look up what other expansions I might have bought

563
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,760
 um, and I think

564
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,960
 I can't remember when marvel champions released the um

565
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,800
 Their big box expansion, but I might be tempted to nominate that as well

566
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
 Um, but yes

567
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,240
 Oh, oh and no, sorry. I forgot one. There's a game called artifact

568
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,400
 Oh, was that in 2019 or 2020? I can't remember now

569
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,280
 But there's a um a single player role playing came called artifact, which is a journaling game

570
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,600
 And I got the the chap who makes it lives in south hampson and a friend of mine

571
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,320
 Um, pointed me at his twitter feed because he was selling factory seconds of the game and I hadn't heard of it

572
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:31,600
 So I didn't back the kickstarter but I got a copy of the physical version for cheap softness twitter and um, it's a game where you

573
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,960
 Basically in most role playing games that are like fantasy driven or maybe not most but like, you know, oh g

574
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,200
 Oh gd and d for instance you go on your adventure you find the dragon you slay it you marry the hot prince

575
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,880
 And you get the loot and artifacts the game where you find a mysterious artifact in the loot and you single player

576
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,200
 Are given a bunch of prompts and you play a game telling the backstory of the artifact you found in the loot

577
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,920
 And I would also say that would I would highly recommend that from a kind of narrative

578
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,880
 Perspective, um, and I think that would be a really good

579
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,120
 I don't think you would ever make it onto the shortlist because it is a very very sporking

580
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:14,080
 Um, but um, but yeah, I would also I would also enthusiastically not only that I think

581
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:19,600
 It is a it is a trice trice game a solo rpg zine

582
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,440
 a

583
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,400
 Mm-hmm the advent of um cheap print a was around plus kickstarter

584
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,600
 plus the renaissance in like um small experimental rpgs has meant there is a

585
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:39,440
 A large proliferation in recent times of little zines that do interesting things with the rpg format and solo rpging or

586
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:47,440
 um, there are several rpgs where you play by mail and you basically physically mail the rpg to like the next player and it's kind of

587
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,600
 executive rather than concurrent and there's some really interesting stuff being done

588
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,720
 this feels like the um

589
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,200
 an interaction between um

590
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,340
 interactive experiences and

591
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,080
 game books and fanzines and I quite like that as a

592
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,920
 Model I mean, I like things that match up different genres

593
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,960
 Oh, I tell a lie. I have played two 2020 video games because I also played

594
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,160
 uh

595
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
 Just dance 2021

596
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,400
 Yeah, no, it's just about to ask is um, his ring fit adventure a 2020 video game because I did play that

597
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,400
 Oh, I think it's probably 2019. Let me check. I'm so I feel like it would be on

598
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,480
 Fair enough. I wouldn't nominate it because I don't think it's sf no or all good, but um

599
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,320
 Beyond that

600
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,080
 It is clearly it is clearly sf no enough, but not very

601
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,800
 Well, that's true. It does have a demon in it, doesn't it?

602
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,400
 Yeah, I mean almost one of the things it does say in this um

603
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:52,240
 In this report is that the vast majority of games have sf and fantasy content

604
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,240
 They don't all but an enormous enormous number of them do. I mean that is probably fair, isn't it?

605
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,160
 Yep, so no twer ringford to venture despite the fact that again it came to prominence in twer

606
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,720
 So I think one of the issues here is that that unlike novels and um

607
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:17,040
 Movies in particular games really do burn through slightly more slowly apart from apart from the triple-a games

608
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,880
 Games do have a longer life expectancy. Yes, that's true

609
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,440
 I mean among us is new for ipad in 2020 and I feel like it's it's a very convenient

610
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,000
 It's very convincing as an ipad game

611
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,040
 Um, but of course it's not a new game. It's been around a year or two and that's not uncommon

612
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,280
 Well, and that that neatly segues into I think

613
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,920
 One of the things I wanted to talk about which is the idea of substantial

614
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,320
 modifications

615
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:53,040
 And the argument made in the report is that you can basically say you're allowed to dominate substantial modifications

616
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,880
 And the substantial modifications will get lots of nominations and the insubstantial ones will get hardly any nominations

617
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,120
 And this will neatly fix itself

618
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,360
 the issue I

619
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,400
 see

620
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,040
 is stuff like among us where among us is not a

621
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,720
 2020 video game really it was released before that

622
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,560
 But it's definitely hit prominence in 2020

623
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,800
 And it has had a version released on a platform where it hitherto did not exist released in 2020

624
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,400
 And I suspect there are people who would not realize it was pre-existing game who would nominate it

625
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,260
 And then the administrators would have to decide are they nominated to get because they think the ipad version is a substantial

626
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,420
 qualification or are they nominating it because it was very popular this year and

627
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,020
 Is it therefore eligible or is it therefore not?

628
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:49,580
 And I think this is actually a thornier issue than the report wants it to be and i'm not sure the report does a good job here

629
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:56,620
 Yeah, but it is in fact not a thorny issue because the ipad version of a game is just like the paperback version of a novel

630
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,100
 And we do have prior

631
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,620
 Are it's not like mythic quest ravens banquet

632
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:10,060
 Which is obviously a substantial modification of mythic quest therefore eligible in this category

633
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:16,060
 That was a masterful reference

634
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,300
 Is it not only is it eligible in this category, but i'm saying now

635
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,420
 I'm going to nominate it and I hope that lots of other people do too

636
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,420
 Oh

637
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:31,900
 God

638
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,900
 TV account are you nominating a

639
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,460
 fictional video game

640
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:42,060
 It's definitely it's definitely not eligible. It's definitely fictional. It's a it's a tv show

641
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,500
 Um about a fictional video game. It is a substantial modification of a previous video game

642
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,340
 Um, but hopefully sometime in 2021

643
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,980
 Mythic quest ravens banquet will be released as a video game and then it will be fine

644
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,340
 That would be brilliant

645
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:57,980
 Um

646
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:04,780
 It's difficult because it's sort of genre in the sense that it talks about science fiction because it does have a character who has one an epular

647
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,780
 And is brilliant

648
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:14,540
 um played by um, oh, what's his name the guy who played the senior good go out world in stargate sg one

649
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,380
 go out

650
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,300
 Go out world

651
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,460
 Which one is the senior one? Hang on though the one that like t york

652
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,100
 f mary abraham, that's the chap

653
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,820
 Is spanish just texted me from the other room to tell me the answer is f re abraham. Thank you, early

654
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,060
 Real time follow up from our live stream

655
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:40,540
 It's difficult because it's a show about making a genre game that therefore has quite a lot of genre

656
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:46,860
 Like adjacentness pleido whether it would be eligible for the best short form hugo or not really

657
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,820
 But then upon 2013 like it is real gray area in things that discuss the genre

658
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,780
 It's pretty it's nerdy enough. I think I think if it got nominations in

659
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,620
 Um, best dramatic presentation short form, which i'm not entirely sure it should do

660
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:05,980
 Um, I think at that point the hugo ministers would have a choice to make it. I think they probably would go

661
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,380
 Oh, yeah, this is kind of genreish

662
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,780
 I I would like to take us back just one second, which is

663
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,740
 Do you say f re abraham was in star gate?

664
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,740
 Yeah

665
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,780
 Really?

666
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,740
 Yeah

667
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,900
 Yeah, he plays the senior go out he plays like um, oh, what's his name?

668
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,540
 Well, this is the thing then I could search him out

669
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,180
 Uh craytack

670
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,220
 Craytack is it something like that a star gate

671
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:37,340
 Oh, that's braytack and that's not f mary abraham. That's why i'm confused

672
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,980
 Oh, in that case, it's my

673
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,820
 It's my fault then

674
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,260
 Well, I was yet

675
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,500
 Who plays him then they look very similar

676
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,940
 I think it's a man who's very looks very similar. Um

677
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,140
 Oh, well, this is just confusing people shouldn't look alike

678
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:57,260
 Having just seen the prestige. I can confirm that that's true. Nothing good comes of people who look alike

679
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,980
 I mean, it's very very confusing

680
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,620
 He he has played a lot of different things there

681
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,500
 He has just not the one I said he had

682
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,740
 So that's which is an important point which I should be brought up on

683
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,100
 But I think me and espania both thought it was him so

684
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:19,820
 He has a guy called tony amendola. So that's why i'm confused. Well, it's not him and he's also not a ghoul

685
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,900
 but anyway, this is

686
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,340
 Revealing too much about my star trek watching habits. Yeah

687
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:31,580
 There's a website on cheeseburger.f mary abraham totally looks like tony abadola

688
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:36,620
 Excellent. Can you send me that website so I can put it at the show notes so I can prove that I am not mad

689
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,020
 You are not mad. Um, but I mean you're not mad for this

690
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:45,980
 Um, hang on. This is great. Yeah, but it's not really you heard a point

691
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,700
 They do look very similar

692
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:54,220
 Still on the subject of the games you go. Um, firstly, um, I think that um

693
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:59,180
 2020 is is possibly quite a bad year to trial this category

694
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,580
 Because I think the triple a gaming industry has taken a little bit of a

695
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:11,740
 Dropping with covid the really the only big ticket game I can think of that's come out this year except for animal crossing is cyberpunk

696
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,620
 I am wondering and a lot of board games have not

697
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:20,300
 Done well either. So I am kind of wondering whether this is the wrong year to try this and I do

698
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,300
 Wonder whether we'll see that when the nominations kind of come in

699
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:30,460
 I think there'll be a I think there have been an awful lot of even more than usual

700
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,140
 sequels and quotes substantial modifications and

701
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,940
 things of that kind um

702
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:44,220
 It is an issue with the gaming industry generally that it makes it's money by selling you the product once and then selling you more bits of it

703
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,940
 Um, that also works for novels and

704
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,660
 And tv shows and movies as we see

705
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,780
 But the hugo voters have always been quite fond of

706
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:58,300
 Original content and I think you'll see some of that in the in the nominations in this category

707
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,900
 I see when I see we should trust the hugo voters to come up with a good category and it'll be good

708
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:07,020
 Yeah, um, the other thing I will say is that I think we should probably touch on

709
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:15,500
 The fact that the nebula awards also reward games, but they reward it specifically for the writing of the games

710
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:21,020
 And I was wondering whether the two of you think that will mean that there is more or less

711
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:27,180
 Overlap between the nebulas and the hugos than in most other categories where they have a kind of shared

712
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:32,460
 theme so obviously the nebula novels and hugos usually have a couple in common

713
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,820
 So the thing is it's only been like two

714
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,100
 Two years of the nebula for best game writing

715
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:44,220
 Yeah, it's a very new category for the nebula's. I thought it was interesting that they were doing it

716
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,180
 Yeah, didn't banda snatch get a nomination

717
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,380
 So banda snatch one the first one. Yeah

718
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,180
 banda snatch one and and

719
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,660
 I mean banda snatch is kind of

720
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,980
 You know banda snatch is not interactive it it pretends to be interactive

721
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,420
 But it has it has zero interactive content and I get very worst off about that sort of thing

722
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:13,980
 Um, I like my games to involve gameplay and there is no gameplay and banda snatch you end up doing the same thing on all routes

723
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,300
 It's just you can miss bits out

724
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,980
 So, um

725
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:22,620
 the winner in 2019 was the outer worlds and the winner in 2018 as we said was banda snatch

726
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,420
 The nominees in 2019 were outer worlds the magicians workshop

727
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:36,700
 Disco Elysium and the fate accessibility toolkit and then in 2018 were the road to Canterbury god of war rent a voice and the martian job

728
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,780
 I will note that

729
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:44,700
 Although there's a lot of clustering in the other big awards the report mentions the nebulas are quite quite different

730
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,540
 I think to the games that were generally getting recognition

731
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,860
 Um, so I my hunch is that the he goes would skew more towards

732
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,900
 The bigger awards than the nebulas have done

733
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:02,060
 But I don't know and it's interesting to see how different the nebula short lists were to the kind of prevailing wisdom in the rest of

734
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:08,060
 Of gaming as it were and I wonder if that's obviously the nebula definition is to do with

735
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:13,740
 Um, specifically the writing so it's it's an award for best game writing not for best game

736
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,500
 So I wonder if that has a because I completely ignores ludonarrative

737
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,540
 I am very interested to see what

738
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:27,420
 How the community starts to write about this how other people start to what they take on this and is and whether

739
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:34,300
 And whether we're going to see some campaigning around this is a chance to recognize video game writers who of course

740
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,020
 you know often

741
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:41,820
 are speculative fiction writers or that that that example of the

742
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,780
 Writer who wants one a nebula is

743
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:51,580
 They would not have put that into their tv show unless they got it from somewhere and they got it from game the games industry where

744
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,700
 um

745
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,260
 Science fiction writers are employed in droves

746
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:01,020
 So I would say the nebula's look a little bit like an outlier to me because there's

747
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:07,900
 many nominations from uh choice of games, which is uh a game studio. I haven't heard of who make interactive

748
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,540
 Fiction um, but I recognize the names as being people who already

749
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:19,340
 have been writing short fiction or novels already. So it may be that in some cases

750
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:25,980
 Uh more s fw a members had played those game because they already knew the writers of those games

751
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,100
 Then would be apparent in like the wider hugo field

752
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:35,180
 It would be quite wrong of me to suggest that or alternatively they nominated things that were eligible by people

753
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,460
 They like regardless of whether they'd had any involvement in the game whatsoever

754
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,700
 and that is also a risk for the

755
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:46,060
 Hugos, but I think less of one in this category than in some of the others

756
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:51,580
 Yeah, I mean, I think it's also very new. It's clearly uh shaking itself down, but it will be interesting

757
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:58,300
 To see where that goes if it does kind of converge with a hugo or split part completely and start rewarding different things

758
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:06,220
 The poet laureate of the old thought podcast claire brianley of groiden has sent us a festive poem

759
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:09,660
 Which we will end the podcast with today

760
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:17,180
 I mean, I would I would like to say that I thought wouldn't this be a great idea and vaguely made a very sh*t attempt at it

761
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:22,620
 Uh and don't mention it to claire and claire sent us a much much much better one

762
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:27,820
 So we should really be thanking claire not only for the excellent poem, but also for saving you from my poetry

763
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:34,220
 Yeah from saving you from the octa thoughts cruise version of this poem, which would not have been as good

764
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,980
 I think it's fair to say

765
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,180
 I sent claire a text message that said

766
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:46,140
 We're thinking we're thinking about doing a christmas octa thought version of towards the night before christmas or

767
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:51,980
 Um a visit from st. Nicholas, which is its proper name and I sent her that text message at

768
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,020
 uh about quarter to

769
00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:04,540
 12 on the 16th of december and at about a quarter to five on the 16th of december we received this poem which claire had immediately

770
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,980
 um

771
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:12,140
 been seized with the need to write um so thank you very much claire it is fantastic

772
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:16,700
 A visit from st. octa thought

773
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,300
 towards the night before christmas when all through the house

774
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,740
 Which is not very big but its best not to grouse

775
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,780
 Not a creature was stirring not even a shrew

776
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,700
 And there nestled shrug snug was the octa thought crew

777
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:36,700
 Not too many time zones apart but instead together in one giant comedy bed

778
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:43,980
 With visions of fested and fester of relaxing and rest or board games and card games and oculus quest

779
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:49,980
 Allison liz in pyjamas with wine and john in his underpants star wars design

780
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:55,180
 Was startled to hear in their silent night place the familiar music of fanfare for space

781
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:02,060
 They all checked their phones text and discord and zoom and then thought of looking outside of the room

782
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:08,140
 When what to their wondering eyes should appear but a bathtub with moose in the place of reindeer

783
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:14,220
 No implausible mcu manifestation, but st. octa thought driving his own punctuation

784
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:20,940
 Now dash now apostrophe hyphen ellipsis on comma on colon

785
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,180
 Now who did i miss?

786
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:28,780
 Of course you're essential both full stop and bracket land here on the roof and let's not make a racket

787
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:33,820
 As if they were listening at double speed there was st octa thought what did he need

788
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:39,660
 Can you help me he asked i'm in quite an odd fix i must fill this bathtub with fresh wheat a fix

789
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:45,260
 The moose eat it constantly licking and slurping i tried them on turbinates but can't stand the burping

790
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:51,100
 We know what you mean liz confided unplanned but john turned his mind to the matter at hand

791
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:56,860
 For some reason we have a hundred to spare a plethora alice and surely that's fair

792
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:02,220
 I like we to fix but some friends called my bluff. It seems i was wrong i could not have enough

793
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:07,900
 And st octa thought said as he made his escape, you know, that's the title of your next sex tape

794
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:14,700
 Of course he less presence in thanks for the food the patron of podcasters wouldn't be rude

795
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,580
 There's no need to list them here nevertheless

796
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,780
 You've all heard the podcast i bet you could guess

797
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:27,340
 The bathtub threw off as they all waved goodbye towards the magnetosphere not quite that high

798
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:30,060
 But they heard him exclaim as you all knew he might

799
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:35,340
 Merry christmas to all and to all a good night and then as the moose took their ultimate leap

800
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:39,020
 Remember this podcast will end at the beep beep
