1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 We have 20 minutes, shall we do some actual topics?

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,800
 Yes, so...

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:21,600
 [Music]

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,800
 Hello everyone and welcome to the OctaThole podcast, a podcast for Science Fiction and Science Fiction

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,120
 from Fandom. This episode is coming to you on the 27th of May 2021. I'm John Coxon.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,840
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,200
 And we have some letters of comment for you all in this low energy podcast.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,000
 And why is this a low energy podcast, John?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,280
 Eurovision because two-thirds of this podcast stayed up to watch Eurovision.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,760
 And it turns out that when you watch Eurovision, even if you're not playing a Eurovision drinking

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
 game, you drink.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,800
 You do drink.

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,760
 And the other third of the podcast did not watch Eurovision or do any drinking,

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,920
 but I did have to unexpectedly work on a Saturday. So I'm tired.

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,120
 But many normal Eurovision things happened at Eurovision, including my favourite track, Not Winning,

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,920
 and a lot of people wearing spangly things and...

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,320
 There was an awful lot of spangle.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,160
 A lot of jokes and the British entry cut no points.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,280
 And it was compounded by the head of the British jurors saying,

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,960
 "Oh, I've just said hello in German and Dutch, but I don't know which is which."

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,480
 Which I think really sums up the UK attitude to Europe and why we got Europoints.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,640
 So it's quite interesting because obviously I did not watch Eurovision,

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,160
 but when I wake up, my Twitch and Facebook feeds are full of Eurovision.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,520
 So now I want somebody who's not me, but might be listening to this podcast,

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,120
 or write a science-fictional story about the intergalactic song contest,

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,840
 where the broadcasting unions of various federation planets.

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
 Oh, that was nominated for a Hugo two years ago.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,480
 It was written by Catherine M. Valente, and it was called Space Opera.

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,320
 Damn.

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,600
 Yes, and I read 30 pages of it.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,160
 I really enjoyed it, but it was divisive.

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,880
 You need to read more science fiction on it.

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,080
 I do. That sounds like the sort of thing I'd really like.

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,040
 Did it have some aliens on a tricked-out tractor singing about spring?

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,240
 Basically, yeah.

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,160
 It was literally Eurovision in space.

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,560
 If you were not a fan of that style of comedy, you did not get on with it.

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,600
 I thought it was quite good.

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,360
 So was it more or less science-fictional than

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,720
 Fire Saga, the story of Eurovision or whatever it's called?

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,240
 It's literally set in space.

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,160
 Yeah, so then yes.

43
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,360
 No, I think, because I know Liz said she didn't like it,

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,960
 I think the thing is with comedy is that the reason comedies don't do well in awards

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,320
 that do not explicitly recognize comedy is because comedy is far more divisive than non-comedy.

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,240
 A sense of humor is way more personal than drama or anything else.

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,520
 So it is, I enjoyed it, but if it doesn't align with your sense of humor,

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,200
 like you will bounce off it hard.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,360
 So yeah, it's like one of those things.

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,520
 Yeah, I think my issue is that I love how Catherine Blente has an extremely strong

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,040
 style in all of her novels, and it can be quite different in all of her novels.

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,000
 But for this one, I read 40 pages and went, "This is trying so hard to have that Douglas Addams

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,160
 sense of humor that I feel embarrassed to be reading it."

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,200
 Like it just hit that sort of like, "I cannot read it because it is trying so hard and failing

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,600
 for me to be funny in this particular way that I just couldn't get further into it."

56
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,800
 It was a really strong reaction, and I don't normally have a reaction

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,360
 that's strong to books actually.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,040
 Like sometimes I will stop reading them because I'm a bit bored, but in this case,

59
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,000
 I was not bored.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,520
 I was just, "Ooh, it triggered something and I could not read any more."

61
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,800
 But I did really like Radiance, one of her previous books,

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,560
 so you should just go and read that one instead.

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,960
 Anyway, we have letters of comment.

64
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,200
 Yeah.

65
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,760
 So, and Rosin wrote in to say, "Four minutes into your last episode did Alan Partridge shout

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,200
 aha in the distance, possibly down into the tunnel that Alison was broadcasting from."

67
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,560
 And we did respond to tell her that we did eventually manage to coax Alison out with her tunnel.

68
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
 But Alison was very happy and we felt a bit bad about it.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I did go back and someone does shout aha in the background at that moment.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
 So, well noticed, and...

71
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
 Is that me?

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,160
 I think it was you, because I didn't notice it while we were recording,

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,080
 or while I was listening to the edited version for later release.

74
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
 So, good ears and...

75
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,880
 Yeah, that is the sort of thing that we're supposed to pick up whilst editing and say,

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,920
 "Oi John, you've left us faint aha in."

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,720
 No.

78
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,560
 It's very quiet.

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
 Why would we have done that?

80
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
 We already got one fewer letter of comment.

81
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
 Are you saying you left it in deliberately as a comment took?

82
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,960
 We would never say things just to get letters of comment, would we?

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,120
 No, we wouldn't.

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,680
 We would...

85
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
 No, obviously not, however, be terrible.

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:28,880
 So, Pete Asullivan also tweeted us to say that his concern with a whole weekend of the

87
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,480
 Wussfuss business meeting can basically be summarised as the devil makes work for idle hands to do.

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,680
 And that is a cogent and succinct criticism of our last conversation.

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
 Thank you very much, Peter.

90
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,400
 You may have a point.

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,920
 Yeah, he goes on to say that his directory is that a business meeting with more time

92
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,720
 would start trying to micromanage the world calm itself.

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
 And I can see that there's a possibility that would happen.

94
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
 It just occurs to me that things like at the moment we have kind of the business meeting

95
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,760
 will appoint a committee and in theory the committee goes away and deliberates for like a year

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,040
 or two years and then comes back with a report.

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,720
 And the question is whether we could take some of that extremely lengthy

98
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
 deliberations that normally happen over a year or two and maybe fire some of them off

99
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,240
 in a weekend in a more concise way, or at least rather than kind of saying a committee will go

100
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,320
 and study that, have a meeting which then set up a committee with

101
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,600
 you know more of a remit for what they're actually going to do which is doable in a year.

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,160
 So I just feel some things have kind of gone off to committees and then something which

103
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
 already takes several years to ratify then spend several years being discussed by committee

104
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,560
 and it just gets kind of slower and slower to change anything.

105
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,360
 Maybe I'm missing the point of the WISFUS business meeting there.

106
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,640
 Well, hang on, I just want to say something in reaction to what Liz said.

107
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,920
 Here, the one thing about that is obviously like some committees are going to take a year

108
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,840
 because they need to like consult with the community and that's a thing you can't shorten.

109
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,960
 But in general like if it's just doing research like I can definitely see that some of those things

110
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,800
 could be shortened perhaps. You could definitely shorten consulting with the community if you do

111
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,720
 it by saying we're going to have a meeting on the internet on this day and if you want to be

112
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,040
 involved this is where you're going to be. But you can't do that with six hours notice, right?

113
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,560
 You can't be like we're going to consult with the community and if the community in six hours

114
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,400
 could be consulted with that would be great. That's not how community consultations work.

115
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,880
 Yeah, so as Spani wrote with two further points on WISFUS, she said it might be worth clarifying

116
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,320
 that member of WISFUS and member of WILCON are the same thing and that is quite right it might be.

117
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,800
 And I think one of the things I specifically said last time is that I would like to see the

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,000
 member of WISFUS expanded to be more than merely the member of the seated WILCON.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,480
 But that leads into a Spani's second point which is that while she agrees that making the business

120
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,720
 meeting easier, better or less mind-numbing to attend is desirable, she is the very of the idea

121
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,160
 to opening it up to anyone on the internet with $50 and a grudge. Not a bad point, a fair point.

122
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,640
 There are a lot of those people. The fact that it's structured at the moment in a way that means

123
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,560
 you have to have a certain level of kind of wealth privilege to make it worth your while attending

124
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,080
 does mean that there is a kind of a gatekeeping aspect by saying it is worth pointing out that

125
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,560
 that does cut both ways. It may mean that the people who attend are more invested in the good

126
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,200
 of the world con than otherwise and that might actually be a good side effect and you would have

127
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,280
 to think quite carefully about how to replicate that if you did try and open it up.

128
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,920
 So that is I think a very good point. Spani's first point brought to you by a conversation

129
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,960
 where she was like sometimes you guys use words and like not everyone will know what the words

130
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,640
 mean and I was like that is a good point. I'm wondering whether we should do some sort of

131
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:59,760
 fanist dictionary episode at some point where newer listeners can get up to date on all of our

132
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,720
 jargon but if you do ever listen to a say something and you're like oh they're using a word and I

133
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,880
 don't really know what it means please do write in because we're not doing it on purpose and we

134
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,920
 would very much like to be told when we are being more obtuse than usual. Yes you can also instead

135
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,840
 of writing to us you could write to Mr. Google who will probably tell you what the word means

136
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:26,720
 and you might want to include contexts like fanak or science fiction fandom with your word

137
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,480
 otherwise you will discover weird things on urban dictionary. Fanak is one of the words that you

138
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,680
 might use. Fanak is a portmanteau meaning fan activity the more you know.

139
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,480
 But it's then often defined as anything that fans do like watching Eurovision.

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,440
 I like Spanish letter. I think an episode purely about jargon would be very tedious

141
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,760
 but maybe we can have jargon corner. Please write to us listeners and tell us what should be

142
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,520
 in jargon corner. We may have too many corners by now but we're virtual we can have as many corners

143
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,480
 as we like. We're a dodecahedron of love Liz. Okay so let's be clear here. The dodecahedrons

144
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:19,120
 don't really have corners. You meant dodeca gone. I did mean dodeca gone. A dodecahedron

145
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:27,200
 has vertices. It does. Well this is good and for those who don't know a dodecahedron is a both-sided

146
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,400
 solid shape. No it bloody isn't. No it isn't. It doesn't have sides it has faces. What we're hearing

147
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,520
 here is a mathematician and a physicist in conversation. All so we have many corners

148
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:48,160
 as we are a mathematical object of indeterminate size. No we've just discussed we don't have any

149
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,840
 corners we have vertices. So actually we have dictionary vertex and jargon vertex and poetry

150
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:03,760
 vertex and I will go back and edit all of those in the previous episodes. Octa thought poetry vortex

151
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,320
 yes let's have some vertices instead. I think that's the way forward.

152
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,200
 Vortices. Maybe this conversation can go down a vortex.

153
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:22,240
 C. Dave wrote in. He's not yet admitted to himself that he's never going to get around to

154
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,040
 casting something in resin. You could Dave just to do it. Yeah I believe in you. And also he says

155
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,760
 he's never going to ascend a was for business meeting and is unlikely to ever get deep enough

156
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,280
 into the weeds to understand all the discussion if he did go but he enjoys listening to the discussion

157
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:45,840
 because his wholebie isn't SFF or fandom it's fandom fandom so yes fandom is a way of life etc.

158
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,080
 I would say I am glad that someone is enjoying the wistful spaces being segments because I suspect

159
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:59,600
 many of our audience have reached the end of the we've had a number of letters to that effect.

160
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:07,120
 And so maybe maybe next time will be a wistful free podcast. I also would say that I did go to

161
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,840
 a suspicious business meeting and that someone gave me a popcorn smoth ribbon which I treasure

162
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,560
 for a person who is a fan of business fandom. That is a very good ribbon. I like that. Popcorn

163
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,120
 smoth. Popcorn smoth as in I'm at the business meeting for the popcorn. Oh because they gave

164
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,840
 you popcorn or because you were eating popcorn whilst watching wisps. No like in the sense that

165
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:38,560
 when you see drama on the discord or a slack sometimes you just comment with a popcorn emoji

166
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,680
 instead of actually arguing. You say I'll get the popcorn. Yeah I don't think it is that I think

167
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,400
 it's that they give out popcorn at the wisps business meeting. No no one gave me any popcorn.

168
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,200
 Yeah no I mean if they gave out popcorn at the wisps business meeting we would go to the wisps

169
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,440
 business meeting. This should be a constitutional amendment. There should always be popcorn at.

170
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,360
 I'm pretty sure I've been to a wisps business meeting that had muffins or something. I think in

171
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,800
 the US there was coffee and muffins. Yeah yeah yeah there is often snacks, snackage in the European

172
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:22,560
 ones. No snacks. No boo. Buck your ideas up Europe. Yes. So Spike wrote to us to tell us two exciting

173
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,560
 things about Winnipeg. Yes. One of which is it's only about a ten-hour drive from Nebraska.

174
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:37,760
 And the second is backman turn overdrive and and you need to know that neither of these quite

175
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,840
 hit my excitability threshold Spike. I think I think because because when you say oh such a

176
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,600
 such a place as always because it's only ten-hour drive from such such another place that's not

177
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,600
 damning with faint praise in the UK that is just a straight-out insult. So it doesn't read to us as

178
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,840
 a compliment or as a like double-edged sword just reads as if this place is awful. Because to me

179
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:12,960
 like an hour away is too long. Ten hours is like Scotland. She sends a link to a song by backman

180
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,240
 turn overdrive and there and we will put the link to the show notes and she would like us to know

181
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,120
 that lead singer is not Chris Garcia because the band would have to have been called Garcia turn

182
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,200
 overdrive. I would also like to say that Spike sends me hand instructions for how to find Nebraska

183
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,600
 on the map which turns out to be find Winnipeg and then go south. And when she's there with the

184
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,560
 instructions I did look at it on a map and I did discover that I have in fact been to Nebraska

185
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,880
 despite saying I had never been to Nebraska but I went through it on a train and the train

186
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,040
 deliberately I think goes to Nebraska at night because there's nothing very interesting to look

187
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,440
 at. Whereas you know it's it spends its days going through Colorado and the Sierra Nevada's which

188
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,080
 are much more fun to look at I think than Nebraska. So sorry Nebraska I have been there but I have

189
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,360
 absolutely no recollection of it. That is that is fair. I have been looking on a map while we

190
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,840
 have been talking and if I drove for 10 hours I could get to the Scottish Highlands. I started

191
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,120
 by looking at Aberdeen but Aberdeen is too close and that is a sentence no one has ever said about

192
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,200
 Aberdeen before. Is it always there lurking in the back of your mind the threat of Aberdeen?

193
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:26,480
 And for people who don't know the details domestic arrangements of octa thought John lives almost

194
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,680
 as fast as it's possible to live and not fall off the bottom of England so it's true.

195
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:42,480
 Right so we we end our letters of comment today with Chris Garcia who says that Winnipeg is pretty

196
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,200
 cool actually he likes the conventions and there's a lot of good food around and yeah he

197
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:56,080
 generally seems quite positive. Farah Mendelson wrote to us to tell us that the solution to the

198
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:03,040
 best cat award is the Village Faked Pet Show Award also also used for Children's Baskerades

199
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,120
 where you give every cat an award for being best cat at something so Badger is the best

200
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,520
 will-con bid-chair cat and Farah's own major Tom who has a Hugo rocket on his nose is quite

201
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,040
 obviously best science fiction cat face which gets through to illustrate a cat with a Hugo on his nose.

202
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,160
 I like this because then Quentin Alice can clearly be best octa thought podcast cats.

203
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:34,000
 It's true. Yeah but in fact um masquerades and and children's pet displays at Village Fets have

204
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,880
 things like the snuggliest cat and the furiest cat and the outchiest cat if one of them has

205
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,800
 bitten the judges. Alice is the softest cat but I think Quinn is the fufiest cat.

206
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,440
 There we go. Regularists should note that I've met John's cats and I cannot tell them apart

207
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,880
 it's all in the ears Liz it's all in the ears. They are both equally soft and fluffy anyway.

208
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:09,440
 It's Banya bought a new phone and as a result of which I can now detect John's cats in photographs

209
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,880
 because prior to that I just believe they were kind of black cat-shaped holes in the middle of

210
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,840
 zoom meetings and pictures and things but but the new cameras adequate identify it as a cat.

211
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:31,120
 Yes. I assume that's machine learning. Probably probably um and then finally we have Chris Garcia.

212
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,760
 Now last episode we said that we did not always go to World Conspiratorism but Chris points out a

213
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,320
 very key point which I had not thought of which is that he is a food world conveyor and he votes on

214
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,400
 his stomach and actually that is a 10 out of 10 way to vote because um my my my parents get

215
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,960
 annoyed with me when we go all holiday because the thing I like best about travel is eating

216
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,920
 and they'll be like do you remember this thing that was really good that was something to do with

217
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,280
 architectural culture or something. I'll be like no and then they'll be like oh and I'll be like I

218
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,280
 do remember that restaurant and they'll be like but but what uh by I bloody love food. Anyone who

219
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,640
 has met me will regard my shape and maybe notice that that is not a surprise but yes um and he

220
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,720
 talks about some of the good food that he had in Dublin. Yeah what I remember from Dublin is

221
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,840
 the donuts. Oh the donuts. The donuts and the pizza at 2am although to be fair the pizza at 2am was the

222
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,640
 other side of Dublin were not the other side of Dublin but it was a long way from the convention

223
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,640
 center but it was near our Airbnb so we did a lot of pizza or put an image in the chapter art

224
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,560
 but it was good and the donuts are applying for a fellowship in Dublin and I would be lying if I

225
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:59,120
 didn't say the donuts had played a role. Alison is honourable. I'm going to be one of the guests of

226
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:06,160
 honour at the Joint Science Fiction Foundation and British Science Fiction Association AGM which is

227
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:16,240
 happening online on the 26th of June. I'm giving a talk um tentatively entitled My Year in Virtual

228
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:23,520
 fandom but I haven't written it yet so if you want to know my writing plan it's that I will not think

229
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,120
 about it until about 8am on the 26th of June and then I will cry for three hours.

230
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,200
 That is having having worked with Alison on projects that seems reasonable.

231
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,880
 It's called Conspire which is a good name, very good name. I think the Science Fiction Foundation

232
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,560
 and the British Science Fiction Association are sort of organisations for critical analysis of SF

233
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:56,320
 in the UK would you say? No I don't think so. The Science Fiction Foundation is a charity

234
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,640
 which uh basically promotes science fiction and related topics. I should actually find out

235
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,760
 what the Science Fiction Foundation's um actual like charitable goal is which I should know because

236
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,240
 I have been on the committee of both the Science Fiction Foundation and I mean I don't mean to

237
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,000
 I don't mean to contradict you but it's to provide research facilities to investigate

238
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,080
 promote usefulness of SF to disseminate information and to preserve for a discriminating

239
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:25,200
 understanding of the nature of so I think it's to be organized for critique like it seems from the

240
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,640
 forums I've got on the website it seems very much geared towards academic analysis to me.

241
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,320
 I think it's much closer to say academic analysis than criticism. What's the difference between

242
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,800
 academic analysis and criticism? That could we could have an entire episode just on that

243
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:48,160
 popcorn? Because I was fascinated by the Hugo finalist who describes themselves as a professional

244
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,320
 enthusiast which I think means an uncritical critic. The Science Fiction Foundation also

245
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,440
 notably organised the George A. Lecture at EasterCon to promote a science topic an interesting talk

246
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:09,600
 by a scientist to people at the uh EasterCon and I think that's also kind of a key part is kind to

247
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,920
 kind of rather than stay in an academic bubble but then try and you know bring this out to the wider

248
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,760
 SF fandom. The Science Fiction Foundation definitely has an outreach role and the British Science

249
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,920
 Fiction Association no matter how hard it is to tell sometimes is a member association it's a club

250
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:34,160
 and it is a club for science fiction fans but it has the kind of same issues around that as as

251
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,560
 you get with other hobbies that that sort of central club never quite accurately reflects the set of

252
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,000
 people who are who might be in the club. And spare. It's not all British Science Fiction fans are in

253
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,120
 the BSFA by um by a long shot um and I left at the point where I discovered that they were sending

254
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,400
 me a lot of paper every month that I didn't want to read. I think they probably stopped sending

255
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,760
 people large bunches of paper but I might be wrong about that. No you are I wrote to the

256
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,240
 membership secretary to be like how do I get the uh paperless option and now I was met with no

257
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,280
 one's ever asked that before as the response which I find incredibly difficult to believe.

258
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:21,040
 That is a lie no one's ever asked the current secretary um paperless option. Yes.

259
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:28,240
 But I think I think when I say they're both um critical organizations I think I think going

260
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,560
 on the website that is unfair but I will say that um both of them send paper to do with criticism

261
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:41,680
 to you if you join them. So it it may well be that uh if you're my primary experience with the BSFA

262
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,200
 has been receiving their publications and their publications are focused around criticism academic

263
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,680
 analysis and reviewing um but going on the website they have also got writing groups and

264
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:58,960
 of participation fund and things like that. So yes I remember at the BSFA very newly um and

265
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,680
 and yeah it's been good so far I enjoy vector even though most of it I don't really understand.

266
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,280
 I think it's also case that uh so there used to be more than one magazine I think they don't have

267
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,920
 matrix anymore it kind of was a sort of news, zine um I had some reviews into lots of media SF

268
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,440
 um I think it was kind of going to go online but then never really took off and at this point I'm

269
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:29,040
 not sure what status is. I think kind of vectors academicness sort of varies depending on who is

270
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,920
 editing it um and what they're focusing on at the time. I feel it may be more of an academic phase

271
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,760
 but I do think some of their recent issues look very interesting. I am not a member but at this

272
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,600
 point I would also need very much a paperless option um and like you said I'm not sure that

273
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,400
 is currently available. Yeah and and of course they run the BSFA awards they have a

274
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:56,880
 long-standing not quite link with Eastercon um because for a while they ran the Eastercon but

275
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,080
 that was a very very long time ago. They do go through more and less critical phases and I think

276
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,120
 the BSFA is in a more critical phase at the moment. They used to have a magazine called Focus for

277
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:16,320
 Aspiring Writers. I believe Focus is still going yes. They actually do have in in in times when we

278
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,560
 can have actual clubhouse meetings. They do have London meetings at least um where they where

279
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,160
 they get an author to do a little talk and then they drink. Yes I did go to number of London

280
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,840
 meetings when I was listening to do that and they were good fun. Back in the before times they

281
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,040
 they worked out that the way that they could make their AGM Quarat was to combine with the

282
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:45,520
 Science Fiction Foundation and have a un-rata one-day convention into which they included both the

283
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,360
 AGMs and some other stuff and that is the that is the thing that is now conspire online. So I

284
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,240
 assume that both organizations didn't have their AGM last year but concluded that they needed to

285
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,480
 have one this year but I don't know. Traditionally I think they would have one AGM just before

286
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,120
 lunch and one AGM just after lunch so that anyone who was not interested in the AGMs could have an

287
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,320
 extra long lunch. This is a good plan. Students union at West University used to provide us to

288
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,240
 attend the AGM by threatening our society funding if we didn't go.

289
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:28,160
 Okay so fanzines before we wrap up today we're going to have a chat about the humble fanzine

290
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:34,720
 and also in modern times the not so humble fanzine that that was a joke for basically for

291
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,760
 Claire and maybe for Alison. So Alison wants to talk about fanzines and I'm going to let her

292
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,320
 and then I'm going to interject with thoughts when she has things that I have thoughts about

293
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,640
 and Liz is going to also have thoughts but perhaps fewer thoughts because Liz doesn't care as much

294
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:01,040
 about fanzines as we do. Basically correct. I now look like a rabbit caught in headlights and the

295
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,480
 reason why is that I had a whole plan for our fanzine episode in which I was going to read

296
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,960
 quite a bit of all of the Hugo finalist fanzines and I was also going to read or reread quite a bit

297
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:22,720
 of the sorts of fanzines that I like and think ought to be Hugo finalists and I did neither of these

298
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:30,400
 things. So I am therefore left arguing from a position of almost complete ignorance.

299
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,840
 Well maybe this can be like the fanzine fanzine five minutes and we can do a full episode at some

300
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,640
 point when you've done it. So I think what I want to do is actually kick off. I think quite a lot

301
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,480
 of people who are listening to Octa Thorpe do like the sort of fanzines I like which where and here's

302
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,360
 the tiny little rant. What you're actually doing is writing about things in order to set up a dialogue

303
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,800
 and discussion with the other people who are reading your fanzine as part of a community

304
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:07,040
 to therefore build interesting thoughts and you have therefore an active letter column and

305
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:17,520
 you you you listen to what your readers have to say and I was very struck yesterday when reading the

306
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:26,880
 um 1700 issues of philosophical transactions which is the Journal of the Royal Society

307
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,280
 um which are now all online and clearly people wrote longer letters then but the fact is that

308
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:40,960
 what that was reads much more like a fanzine than than a lot of the Hugo finalist fanzines where I

309
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,240
 am not seeing the interplay of of different community views in the way that I would expect

310
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,560
 and I know that that interplay does happen it just doesn't I think happen in the pages of fanzines

311
00:27:52,560 --> 00:28:00,480
 anymore um or not the pages of fanzines that get regularly nominated for Hugo's. I would like to see

312
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,200
 more of the sort of thing I like getting onto the Hugo shortlist and I want to think about how we

313
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,400
 can make that happen does that sound like a kickoff rant for a discussion of fanzines?

314
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,920
 Yes I have thoughts. Good. So oh sorry press a company except it obviously

315
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:28,560
 except not because yes no I mean so Journey Planet the um fanzine which I um edit as part of a

316
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:36,960
 enormous sort of amorphous blob with many heads and tentacles snap out that was a

317
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,240
 a tentacle snapping out listeners tentacle snap out and snare interviews with people and

318
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,360
 and things like that but we don't really have a letter column so in that sense um we are not a

319
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:55,600
 fanzine that fulfills Allison's exhortation to uh community dialogue I will say two things here

320
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,800
 which I think will probably cause letters the first one is I think and this is an argument

321
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:10,480
 that I've had with people before the traditional fanzine fandom never really developed beyond

322
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:19,280
 PDFs being shared on a website uh with lots of PDFs on it and that is as and and and I don't have a

323
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,480
 problem with that being a form of fanzine that people enjoy and want to engage with

324
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,160
 but there was I think a very hard kind of edge to the traditional kind of fanzine community who

325
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,280
 who progressed and moved with the times and like they went from mimeo to word processors and they

326
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:43,840
 went from kind of printed fanzines to PDFs and then they kind of stopped at PDFs and there is this

327
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,560
 disconnect between the community of people who make PDFs and the community of people who are doing

328
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,280
 fan writing in more accessible media and I don't have a problem with people preferring PDFs and

329
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,520
 wanting to play in that space and then that's brilliant and if that's your bag great but I do

330
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,440
 think it is a shame that there is this this real step between the community of people who are doing

331
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,400
 that and like the community of people who are doing fan writing everywhere else on the internet

332
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:15,520
 and I think that is something that is not wholly the fault of either camp I am frustrated with both

333
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,800
 groups that there is not a gradient in between those I think it's just the way it ended up being

334
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:26,880
 but like it is a shame I think that there are not more people from the fanzine community that I

335
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,080
 grew up in making fanzines that are not just PDFs being shared on the internet some notable

336
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,640
 exceptions to this include the excellent banana wings which is also available in e-pub formats now

337
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,680
 which I think is great I was doing e-pubs before I wrapped up procrastinations and I always thought

338
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,560
 they were a very good vehicle for that more kind of traditional fanzine but most fanzines are still

339
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,600
 PDFs which are very difficult to read for example on a phone which is where I do most of my reading

340
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,200
 of things that are not novels or comics and so banana wings I think does a really good job and

341
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:08,320
 is one of the more innovative players in this space the other one is Alison did a letter fanzine

342
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:16,240
 through email which I think she did two issues of a few years ago I'm definitely doing another one

343
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,040
 of those as soon as I finish this you go vote packet and punctuation and get eastbound 2023 sorted

344
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:30,160
 yeah so 2024 look out for issue three and lolzine was inspired by Alison's

345
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:37,120
 zine in that regard but these are zines that come out over email and have more of a traditional

346
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,440
 fanzine sensibility in the like lolzine and Alison's zine both had letters of comment

347
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,880
 and had that kind of letter column experience but were not doing it in a kind of printed

348
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:58,880
 fanzine way but kind of playing with with with more up-to-date media Chuck Conner did a CD

349
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,640
 ROM fanzine which was about 10 or 12 years ago now but it was basically he was sending you a CD

350
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,040
 ROM and it had a website on it and you browse the website and I thought that was fantastic and that

351
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,120
 was kind of before WordPress and stuff like that got popular and I was like this is really great

352
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,680
 and I can see how this is going to be really cool in the future and then no one's really

353
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:24,720
 played with that and lolzine did start trying to do a kind of website based experience but it's

354
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,640
 quite hard and maintaining websites is tedious so I do understand why more people do not do that

355
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,720
 because it requires an awful lot more consistent effort than making a pdf that you then upload

356
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,560
 somewhere does on the other side of the coin I think the people making more modern fanzines are

357
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,280
 ignoring that letter column thing but I think part of the reason for that is that there are so

358
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,960
 many more places you can have those conversations now than there were when the traditional fanzines

359
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,280
 were kind of coming out so in the old days in like the 50s if you wanted to have a conversation

360
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,400
 with people you did it in the letter column because you couldn't just tweet at them or text them

361
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:08,240
 but now like I think in a way Twitter is kind of like a worldwide letter column and so I think

362
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,120
 part of the reason we're seeing much less engagement in zines themselves is because a lot of that

363
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,960
 engagement has been shunted to other platforms and I see why that's happening but I do think it's a

364
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,440
 shame because I think there is merit to having a consistent group of commentators and building

365
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,400
 that conversation that is more coherent and I think that's something that OctaThork does in that we

366
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:40,160
 have the letter column which we have kind of poached from old style fanzines but is also

367
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,520
 something you see in a lot of the tech podcasts that me and Alison kind of formed our opinions on

368
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,880
 how podcasts should work by listening to and where you do have this sense of community and

369
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,680
 this sense of comment and this building up of relationships with the commentators and the audience

370
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:05,520
 and so I think we're trying to build that kind of coherent conversation in OctaThork but doing it

371
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:11,120
 in a way that isn't a PDF on our website and so sometimes I refer to Lulzine as an episode and

372
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,760
 sometimes I refer to OctaThork as an issue and that's because in my head they're both very much

373
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,360
 attempts to do the same sort of thing which is to lever more modern styles of communication

374
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:28,480
 but to try and capture that sense of community that the fanzines I read when I was younger kind of

375
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:36,320
 addressed and also if anyone knows Jim DeLiscard, get him to publish another bloody Gerald will you

376
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,240
 because that's the third thing that's wrong with fanzines today there's not enough Gerald.

377
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,640
 I now of course have many many things to say but that's all we've got time for this week on

378
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,280
 OctaThork so it's good oh no we can't you John has to do that bit.

379
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:59,440
 Am I am I not allowed like you know a 30 second rebuttal? I believe you're allowed 90 seconds

380
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,120
 which is fine I can do it in 90 seconds I have two responses mostly to John one is that I

381
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,360
 hadn't realized that what you were doing when you persuaded us to set up OctaThork was stealthily

382
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,400
 reinvigorating your fanzine tradition but well done I do like the regular commenter

383
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,080
 commenters who write to us very often thank you very much and if anyone hasn't written

384
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,240
 as a letter for a while please write in and tell us how you're doing I'd like to hear from you

385
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:32,400
 and second I think that in a way what is happening in the wider world is maybe something

386
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,680
 that fanzines can learn from which is I think people are leaving Twitter a little bit and maybe

387
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,240
 moving to platforms like sub stack or other kind of sub stack clones where you can have

388
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,040
 something which is a letter which gets emailed to people but you can also have a thriving

389
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,800
 comment section under them now I know a lot of sub stack seem to set that up by essentially

390
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,440
 having paid subscriptions and then you have special threads for your paid subscribers and

391
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,480
 that's maybe not a model to move to but that is it kind of feels like a blog that you email to

392
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,600
 people but it does seem to be working in a lot of fields to get people really engaged and

393
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,080
 discussing with each other I just want to say I didn't deliberately start OctaThork to try

394
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,560
 and reinvigorate my fanzine sensibilities it just sort of accidentally happened when we started

395
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:27,920
 getting layers of comment so it wasn't as insidious as it sounds when you put it like that I didn't

396
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,400
 mean to hoodwink anyone but yes yeah yeah I think those are good points and I should also

397
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,760
 note file 770 does have a thriving comment section underneath each post and I should

398
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,000
 I should not have left file 770 out because I think past 770 is actually the one great the other

399
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,440
 great example of a traditional fanzine that did really successfully bridge that cap and Mike

400
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:58,400
 Glyer won several hugos I think in recent years in part because he had successfully managed to do

401
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,280
 that please write in tell us if we're wrong please also write in if you haven't written in for a while

402
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,920
 we miss you I was going through the old letters of comment of a day and Karen Schafer was messaging

403
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,280
 us about her jigsaw's how are your jigsaws Karen we liked hearing about boats so yes we really

404
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,160
 do have to wrap up Alison doesn't want to wrap up she is simmering with things she wishes to say

405
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,960
 but that is good because it means that when letters of comment come in saying them we will be able to

406
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,760
 segue seamlessly into fans these next episode listeners I have gone from comatose to to simmering

407
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:41,920
 in one hour all all that has to happen is that I say wrong things about fandom and they are

408
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,840
 some wakes up great quick and on that bombshell it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's

409
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:57,840
 goodbye from me
