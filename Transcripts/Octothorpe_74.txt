John
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 74th episode of Octothorpe, the podcast of eldritch poetry, which is coming to you on the 5th of January 2023. I'm John Coxon.

Alison
I'm Alison Scott.

John
And today we have something a little bit different for you.

Alison
We asked you for poetry and Sandra Bond has delivered! She has sent us this lovely pastiche, thanks very much Sandra. And I'm not sure we can do it justice but we'll have a go.

John
There’s an intriguing Lovecraftian hellscape,
Where fumes make the fetid air glum:
And Alison Scott and Liz Batty
Went there with John Coxon, their son.

Alison
A broth of a boy was young Coxon,
All dressed in his best like a swell,
And he carried a plastic light sabre,
The best one that Woolworths could sell.

John
They didn’t much rate that dimension,
Though the angles looked wonky and wrong,
And Alison thought her accordion
Sounded better than Dagon’s old song.

Alison
So seeking for further amusement
They paid to go into the zoo,
Where they’d shoggoths and deep ones and serpents,
Not to mention Almighty Cthulhu.

John
Now Cthulhu was peaceful and passive,
His tentacles twitched as he slept,
He lay in a somnolent posture,
As he dreamed of the secrets he kept.

Alison
John Coxon had heard about Cthulhu,
His unspeakable nature and that,
And it made him a tad disappointed,
An Elder God, lying there flat.

John
So Coxon, he took his lightsaber,
Like Skywalker or one of those,
And ere Alison or Liz could stop him,
He shoved it up great Cthulhu’s nose.

Alison
It was certain that Cthulhu di’n’t like it,
For giving a kind of a roll,
He opened his cavernous mouthpiece,
And vacuumed out John Coxon’s soul.

John
And Alison fled with a gibber,
And Liz she fled too, with a wail,
And they dragged little Coxon behind them,
Like a Tindalos hound with its tail.

Alison
They made it out of that dimension,
Which I think is more than they deserved,
And decided to record a podcast
About all the things they’d observed.

John
And Octothorpe came out as normal,
And it’s pretty good fun on the whole,
But the funny thing is that John Coxon
Seems to get on just fine with no soul.
