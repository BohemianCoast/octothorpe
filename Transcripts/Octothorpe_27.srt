1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 I am excited about Eastercon. I am really excited about Eastercon. I, oh gosh, wow, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, I'm gonna spend 4 days in a virtual bar when I'm not doing a lot of other things that I've also committed to doing for the Eastercon.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 So it looks like it's going to be like any other Eastercon in that I have to do 97 things every hour and I'm perpetually exhausted. But at least when I need a little lie down, I'm going to be very close to my own bed.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Liz, do you have any excitement?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 No, I'm not very excited about Eastercon, that's the problem.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Well, that'll go well at the start of the episode. That'll properly like set all up. I like that.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I am the EOR of Eastercon.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 27th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for Science Fiction and Science Fiction fandom, which will be coming to you on the 18th of March 2021.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I'm John Coxon.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I'm Alison Scott.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And I'm Liz Batty.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And today we have many letters of comment which have been triggered by our anniversary.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 So we have letters of comment from Pat McMurry, D.C., Chris Garcia, Mark Plummer, Karen Schafer, Jerry Sullivan and Claire Breyerley of Croydon.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Wow.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Which I think might be a record, except for the episode we did where we had ignored all of that as a comment for 10 episodes, which wasn't really a record because of density, but more through incompetence.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 So starting from the beginning, Patrick McMurry says that he enjoyed the panels at PicoCon, but didn't do the social space.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And he writes something about Eastercon, which no longer makes sense because Eastercon have made announcements.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 That's foreshadowing.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And also notes that he ate Polish with his wife in the evening of PicoCon, which is traditional.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And I've never eaten Polish food at PicoCon, but it sounds like a good tradition that I think I should muscle in on when the world's back to none.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Either of you like pierogies?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I don't think I've ever eaten Polish at PicoCon.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I'm sure we probably used to go for... Oh, there's a little pizzeria in South Kensington that's like a Princess Diana Memorial.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I wonder if Pat is referring to the fact that for many years, only place to eat at South Kensington station was a Polish restaurant called the Kies.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Nowadays, of course, there are many places to eat at South Kensington station, and I'm always very surprised.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 But I too have eaten Polish at PicoCon for this reason.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I think my traditional one has been Chinese at PicoCon.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I seem to remember going out for dinner with various people and having a quite enormous amount of Chinese food one year, which was very delicious.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Oh, God, I'm hungry now.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Karen Schafer wrote to us to say, "The fishlapping came from Monty Python, you know, and I think I did know that actually, but I forgot."

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Yeah, when she emerged, I was like, "Oh, yes, I think I also knew that, and I'm not sure, because we did not mention it, and it did not occur to me at the time.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 So thank you very much for writing in on that topic, Karen."

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Oh, that is very useful.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Chris Garcia wrote that he is the love of Claire's poem, and he expressed excitement about the game Starcrossed.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And he mentions cheap ass games, cheap ass games, which also use components from other games you probably have in your house.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Yeah, I nearly mentioned them last time, because they were the company I was thinking of when I was talking about using stuff you've already got in your house to play games with.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Yes, I will say that.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 While that was true, the last time I bought a cheap ass game, when I went to look at their selection more recently, they have massively pretty enough all of their games, and I am not sure it is any longer true, which I think may indicate that if you want people to take you seriously as a game designer, you have to make your games look good.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Which is sort of a shame, but I can see why.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I believe they're also somewhat less cheap ass than they used to be.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Indeed.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I mean, they were amazingly cheap.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 They were.

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And also pretty good games.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Yeah, yeah.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I used to have Savedock Lucky and Kill Dr Lucky, and actually I played them on the internet with Liz.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 It did, it did you?

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 I think I did, Liz, but now I remember it might have been a lot of other people from Third Row, but not you, because we were in the city.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 But not you, because we played in the evening, and you were doing a sleep.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I let Hog 1 save Dr Lucky by refusing to play a card that meant he could not save Dr Lucky, because I thought that the next person after me would be able to, and the next person after me wasn't able to.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 So Hog got away with a cheeky save super early game, because I was trying to play strategically and ended up giving him the win.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 If I had to give anyone the win, it'd be Hog.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Yeah, I have absolutely no memory of this.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 That probably doesn't mean it was, it was not.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Yeah, but I remember, I remember Hog was there.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I'm pretty sure Andrew January and Nutty were there.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 If this was your games playing party, I came to the early bit and then I left at about midnight my time and did not say I had to play more games.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 So,

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And then just to wrap up Chris's lock, in his new lock segment, he calls needlessly updating OctaThaw ville on my multitasking.

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 He says he is hanging in a Clubhouse chat, listening to OctaThaw, playing a round of sushi go, dealing with Jira tickets and writing a lock.

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 The man is a marvel.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 So, he also called EasterCon easier con, and he refused to change it, because he thought that was a good name for it.

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So, you know, thank Chris.

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Chris, please update us.

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 If you're hanging in a Clubhouse chat and are also listening to OctaThaw, how did you do it?

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Do you have like headphones with one in one ear and one in the other?

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Or do you just have them both like streaming at once and your brain can somehow decode the separate audio streams?

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Because I am interested now in how you do this.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 DC wrote to us to say that the main thing that was keeping him sane in the apocalypse was us.

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 So, that was very nice of him really.

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Yes.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 He was talking about my regular Zoom chats and also punctuation and podcast.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So, yeah.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 We're glad you're enjoying us, DC.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Glad to help.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Mark Plummer wrote in to help us decode Angie's fiendishly complex code for listing Agatha Christie books and he writes.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 N or M? What could it possibly mean?

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I am now ready to advance a theory.

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 It's a bit out there, but hang with it, okay?

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Could it be an allusion to Agatha Christie's novel N or M?

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Uh, yes.

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 That is, that is, thank you for running in, Mark.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 You win some sort of a prize.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Aproper of nothing.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Plochty used to wonder whether it should have some kind of joke indicator because of the number of people who wrote in to explain the jokes that we hadn't explained in the previous issue.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Mark is also joking.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I don't know, obviously Mark is also joking.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Oh good.

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I mean, I genuinely did have to go and Google to find out that was Agatha Christie novel.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Mm-hmm.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Oh, fine.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 No.

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I mean, so Angie did tweet out as to say that she bet that a certain Croydon correspondent could crack the code.

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 So Angie was right and Mark, our Croydon correspondent of Agatha Christie novels has cracked the code and we will send all further Agatha Christie questions to him fourth with.

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And then we had a lock from Jerry Sullivan.

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Yes, so Jerry sent us a very nice set of comments to say she was not really a podcast person, but we appear to have changed her mind, which is the best letter of comment.

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So she started with episode 26 and is working backwards and is now on episode 19.

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 She's pretty good going.

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And she's having many, many thoughts about John in Baths of Weetbeak.

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Too much information, Jerry.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 I think, has anyone ever had to do that?

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 You know, not really a nice break, but the thing where you're supposed to eat two digestive biscuits and then whistle as fast as you can as like a sort of physical challenge.

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Cream crackers, but yeah.

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Yeah, I think the Weetbeaks would also be a good food for that.

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 So John, if you haven't done it, I think you should get a Weetbeaks and see if you can eat a Weetbeaks and how quickly you can whistle after eating a Weetbeaks.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I've just had an idea for the opening ceremony of punctuation too.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 A terrible idea.

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I've just had an idea for John's ASMR YouTube channel.

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Ah, yep, yep, most excellent.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And then finally, our most prolific contributor of locks.

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And Lexi, prolific and Lexi.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Which is the name of her sex tape.

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Um, am I gut that out?

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Oh, I think you might have got that out, yeah?

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Oh, cleverly of Croydon writes to say that she listens to the podcast and she is providing the amount of comment that we seem able to accommodate.

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Which is fair.

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 We do not go into as much detail on Claire's locks as there is detail in her locks.

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I think it is, I think it is reasonable to say.

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 But her locks are very good and we always very appreciate getting them.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Yes.

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Claire's locked off fantastic and you, the listener, will be able to discover that this is indeed the case.

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Because alongside Octothor Poetry, our anniversary poetry anthology of Octothor Poems, we're going to be doing "Lock to Thorp",

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 which is an anthology of the letters of comment we have received.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And it is truly surprising to me that it took over a year for me to notice that pun.

124
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 We could have been saying "Lock to Thorp all along", couldn't we?

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I know.

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 The real "Lock to Thorp" was the friends we made along the way.

127
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 But yes, so, look out for that one.

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Efansines.com.

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I haven't asked Efansines.com whether we can put it there, but I'm sure they will ask.

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And I quite like the idea of having them in a PDF on a website and we can also put some editorial comment in, which would be good.

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Yes, and doing it once a year means that we don't have to do it every episode, which is good.

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Yeah, I think it was interesting to me because obviously if we had a paper fanzine, we'd just be able to publish lots of letters of comment and you could read them all in full.

133
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But by doing it as a podcast, I think we feel that we need to condense them or edit them for broadcast in some way.

134
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Otherwise, we probably could spend a good half an hour reading out all the letters and responding to them.

135
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 But I think also because they're letters and people have maybe been writing as letters thinking they would not be published, they're maybe ones that need to be edited or in other way condensed in order to go in a paper fanzine.

136
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Because I think it's a different relationship.

137
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 People send as letters, I think, not expecting everything will be read out word for word.

138
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And they send as letters with bits saying, you know, this bit is not for reading out on the podcast.

139
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 So, yeah, it was quite interesting to think about how lock culture works differently for podcasts than it does for paper fanzines.

140
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 No, and I think I think I think publishing an amish as Pete Sullivan called it in a forum somewhere.

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I don't think it was a tweet because he's not in the mentions of our Twitter account.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 But I'm sure I saw him comment something along the lines of I was wondering if you were going to do an anish and then you said you were and that's good.

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 But yeah, I think the benefit of doing it as an anish is that like we can publish a retrospective of kind of what people were commenting on and it will be a good kind of look back at the year.

144
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And it means that, you know, we're not kind of doing a fanzine as well as a podcast, which might be a bit tricky.

145
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 But, yeah, it gives us the ability to kind of share with listeners the wisdom of our inter interlocutors.

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 I have no idea if that means column layer of comment right here, but I've decided it does.

147
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 So, you know, letter hacks letter hacks. Yes.

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 That's good.

149
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 We did also get a poem. So we got a poem from Chris Garcia. Chris has written as a poem and it is called three roads converge in a Thorpen wood.

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 No one knew the world would shut, but that we'd find a light called Octothorp, three fens deep cut that makes the world seem right.

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Unlike most pods upon I came, he locks rain in the dark, post talk of cons and books and games. Truly sorry, Mark.

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Chris and will say a thing that John will not near Grock, and Liz will think it gives a ring, though somehow they'll still talk.

153
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And finally, they wrap their talk as it ends with a beat. G-mails open for my squawk because it's goodbye from me. A very good poem. Thank you.

154
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 So, since last time we recorded, Eastercon have released two weekly podcasts in which they have announced that they are going to be using Gather Town for the social spaces of their convention, and they have announced that their program will be accessible through both Gather Town and through televisions, smartphones and tablets.

155
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 So, we have thoughts, which is fitting for our anniversary episode that we get to have thoughts about Eastercon going virtual because that was one of the things we discussed quite a lot in the very first episodes of Octothorp.

156
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 So, Gather Town, for those who don't know, is basically a bit like what would happen if you merged Zoom with Pokémon but took out all of the animal slavery.

157
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 It is a top-down, 16-bit view of a world that you can walk around and when you get close enough to people, their videos pop up and you can talk to them, and if you walk away from them, their videos go away and you can no longer talk to them.

158
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And in this way, it somewhat resembles real life.

159
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 It also has the ability to kind of put objects in that world that can be interacted with, and so the reason I have spent lots of time in Gather Town previously is mostly because a lot of conferences are in the world.

160
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 So, a lot of conferences have been using Gather Town to do poster sessions because post-decisions are very difficult to do over Zoom, and so having some sort of spatial way of doing it has been a huge boon to that kind of information presentation.

161
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I quite like Gather Town, so my reaction to this news was broadly positive, but we would be remiss if we did not say that there are a number of people in the British fandom as a community who have highlighted that they are in the world.

162
00:14:47,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I've highlighted that they are concerned about some of the accessibility issues that Gather Town has, and there is kind of widespread discussion of this on various Discord servers, but also there is a post that Alice and Doug up during this discussion from a conference that had used Gather Town and received quite a lot of criticism for that on an accessibility basis.

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 And Gather Town's stance on accessibility is basically a question on their website that says, please email us if you want to know about how accessible we are because they don't really have a good story there.

164
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 So, you know, there are pros and cons.

165
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 One of the big points for discussion when this was first announced was people who didn't have computers because Gather Town requires a desktop or laptop computer.

166
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 There is a beta tablet client, but it is apparently a bit wonky and doesn't work terribly well.

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And people were a little bit concerned that if they didn't have a computer they wouldn't be able to come to EastCon.

168
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 But as I say, the program has been subsequently announced to be available to other platforms as well and not just on traditional computers.

169
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 So that's if you're, if you're mostly interested in program, that will be less of a problem.

170
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 But it still does exclude people who are interested in the social spaces.

171
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And as I say, personally, I'm excited about this, but I do understand where a lot of other people who are more kind of concerned are coming from.

172
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Liz and Alison, what did you think about EastCon's platform announcement?

173
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I think I want to say something very quickly about EastCon's announcements, which is that it's becoming increasingly clear that dispensing information by means of YouTube videos is not necessarily the most efficient way of getting it out to the community.

174
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 It makes it hard to share. It means that other people have to summarize what you've done or provide transcripts or all of these things.

175
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 At the first point when they go up, the captions aren't ready because of the way that YouTube works.

176
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 So if you do your social media shares at that point, you don't actually have your captions and it's all a bit harder than it maybe needs to be.

177
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And I think there's a lesson here for future conventions.

178
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Probably a bit late for this one because they've decided this is their information strategy, but I don't think it's as good an information strategy as having clear focused news posts that are then supported by short videos where necessary.

179
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Anyway, as to what they announced, I also quite like Gathertown.

180
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I have been to a full event in Gathertown where they tried to deliver the program entirely through the Gather and it really did not work and they had to revert to giving people direct links.

181
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 So I think EastCon's decision to say straight up you will be able to directly get at the content without having to go through Gather to get it, I think is a good one.

182
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And then those people who want the shared experience of being a Gather and whose computers could cope with it will have it there as an option, but for the rest of us will just sit on our sofas and watch things.

183
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I think a lot of people aren't familiar with Gather yet because it's not been used as much in British and other European and American fandom as some as Zoom is Discord.

184
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And the conventions in America that have used it, it's tended to be for their parties which tend to be late at night which tend to be like at 3 o'clock in the morning in Britain so we've not had a chance to go to them.

185
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I think I'm going to run some test Gathers for my mates and hopefully that will give people a chance to have a play with it.

186
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And some of the people who think are very worried about it will be less worried when they've had a go because I think you spend most of your time in video chats just the same as with any other function.

187
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 But I think there is a accessibility problem with Gather and I think it's a little bit of a shame that it's the whole of the social space.

188
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 But I entirely understand that this issue of there being lots of different platforms is also difficult for people so there isn't a perfect solution yet.

189
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I don't think we've completely solved the problem of how to do these conventions.

190
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Yeah so I think some of my issues are the same as Alice and I will say that I haven't really used Gather Town, haven't been to any events that use Gather Town.

191
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I will pop into some of Alice and Gather parties I think to test it out because I'd like to try it out.

192
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And I hope the EasterCon will also have some practice Gather sessions.

193
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 It doesn't need to be necessarily in the space they have designed.

194
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 It could just be in some kind of test arena where you can just like move about and see how the proximity chat works and maybe interact with some objects.

195
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I think running a few test sessions would be good otherwise they're going to have a lot of people turn up on Friday morning and spend most of your Friday troubleshooting with people.

196
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 I also wanted to pick up on Alice's point about I don't think there is one platform that solves all these problems.

197
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And I think my issue is that we've had a video from EasterCon that basically said we do have a great platform and it's going to be amazing and it's going to be the whole convention in one and we're brilliant.

198
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And then we sort of wait a few weeks and it's like oh it's Gather Town.

199
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Why didn't you just say a month ago it was Gather Town.

200
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And then we probably all be more excited than we are now because at this point I was like well I was waiting for you to unveil your amazing new platform and actually it's a platform that a lot of people are familiar with and say yeah it's pretty good but it's got problems xy and z.

201
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And I do think that having one video that tells us it's Gather and then having everyone come along and say oh we can't access this on phones we can't access on tablets we can't do anything with us unless it's on a you know full computer.

202
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And then coming back a few days later say but of course you'll be able to watch a program on your TV and all the smartphone or tablet.

203
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It just seems like the wrong way to get the information out should have just been all there in one text post with some up show videos that you can watch.

204
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So that's not really so much a comment on their platform which I haven't used enough to give a full opinion on but again on their sort of information dissemination strategies.

205
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 I don't think it's unfair to say that although I was completely behind these con I was a little bit worried by the fact they hadn't announced anything because I thought you know there's not a lot of time and if there's been a lot of this up from scratch like you know why have they not announced anything

206
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 and you know they came out and said it's Gather and I'm like oh few I know that Gather works.

207
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Thank goodness like there will be a convention and I will go to it in a row.

208
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 But I will say is that I think it would have been really helpful if a lot of this community discussion about the pitfall with Gather had been had say in November so that the convention could react to those criticisms and kind of actually have a dialogue

209
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 about and I do worry that because these things are these conversations are happening now it will mean both that the convention doesn't really have time to meaningfully take those concerns on board but it also means that the criticism and the kind of

210
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 it's not really a controversy but the controversy that there is there will be at risk of spilling over into the convention whereas if they'd announced a few months ago I think it would have been had time to simmer down had kind of had time to come to

211
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 before the convention started so I do think that's a little bit of an own goal part and I think most of these problems can be traced to a lack of a lack of thought about how to disseminate information.

212
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 I have two thoughts on that the first is that we're definitely not a rumor podcast but I have seen a slightly incautious post from a committee member that said something like there have been a lot of dead ends and false starts that lead me to think that they may not have settled on Gather quite as early as as they might have done and they may have spent a lot of time investigating

213
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 different options before concluding that they were doing Gather and I know that they're planning to have a really elaborate space that's been designed for the convention that should be a lot more exciting to hang out with the just stop Gather but I do kind of go well at the end of the day the reason you're in the space is to meet people not to not to marvel at the amazing science fiction

214
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 art so I am not entirely sure how that will work. The other thing about the compressed type scale is that those of us who are doing things for the convention who have like either the trading or we're taking art or we're doing it working on an area of the con really don't still don't know very much about what the bits of the con will be in will look like

215
00:23:44,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 and that is quite constraining at this point I'm kind of like counting the days ago I need to know what the space that the dealers will be in will be like because I know what a dealers room looks like but I don't know what you're going to be you know I need to prepare art that will fit into the space and I don't know what you're asking me to prepare at the moment and I don't like really having to do these things at last minute I would prefer to have them

216
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 tidy up and tucked away weeks before the convention so that I can not fret about them at the last minute.

217
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 It's interesting you say they might have tried out various different platforms before settling on Gather because it does kind of imply that they ended up setting their pricing structure before they knew how much the platform they were using would cost which gets you into an interesting corner.

218
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Obviously like this is all unknowable things and we don't we are not privy to what happened on a committee level.

219
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And so you know some speculation ahead.

220
00:24:44,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 But I do wonder whether the price was set because they sort of thought well we know we can use Gather and so let's build the price around like a budget based on using Gather and if we can come up with something we like better than brilliant.

221
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 But we've got Gather as the kind of default or fallback technology but I do know what you mean like at the point where they said it's going to be 50 quid for online.

222
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 I assumed that meant they knew what the platform was but they may not have done I don't know.

223
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 But if they're giving us full access together for four days that's that explains what's 50 quid because that's going to cost them quite a lot of money.

224
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Yeah, no I mean yeah but I think Gather is not cheap but I think it does offer things that you can't do well for cheap.

225
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 So I think I can understand why they've decided to make that choice.

226
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And I'm really interested to see because I've not been to any science fiction conventions that have used this platform so really interested to see how this works as a platform for more leisure oriented activities.

227
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I'm particularly interested to see how the panels will work if you go to them in Gather.

228
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I mean if they don't work well then obviously there are I mean I'm presuming they're going to be streaming on either YouTube or Twitch and we don't know that for sure but that is my assumption based on the second video they posted which was about kind of the program and how they're doing it.

229
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 But like given that I can have that on a phone or tablet if the Gather integration isn't great then there's not much kind of risk there if you like but I am keen to try it out and gather to see whether it does work well.

230
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Yeah they've said it'll be available on TVs and so unless they're restricting that to TVs that were bought in about the last year YouTube is practically the only thing they can use.

231
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 I don't think I should criticize them for having to set their pricing structure based around what you're probably right is having a fall back of using Gather and then looking at other things because to be fair we did run punctuation.

232
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And we had a pretty good idea of a budget but we weren't really that sure of it before we started taking people's money and it turns out we overshot.

233
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 We licked our fingers and held them in the air. Yeah basically but it's a lot easier to do that when you're asking for the commitment to £5 and not £50.

234
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I think that is my other thing which I'm sure I've said in the podcast before but there are people that I know and like who would normally go to Eastercon who are saying this year.

235
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Yeah I can't afford it and that makes me a bit sad.

236
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 It seems slightly odd actually because although it's £50 that is not cheap that's the whole cost whereas Eastercon costs would be a vast amount more than £50 normally.

237
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 So I feel that I know I've got people going I see what they're offering and I do not think that £50 is a good value call for me.

238
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 But that's not quite the same as saying I absolutely cannot go to it and spend the money because obviously if you were going if you were involving travel and food and accommodation for a weekend you'd be spending a lot more than £50.

239
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 There are some people for whom the style of convention we ran a punctuation that has been very popular over the last year with a kind of zoom discord hybrid of social spaces has not worked very well.

240
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And there are at least a couple of people I've seen who have said that they're intrigued by gather because they wonder whether that will work better for them for social spaces.

241
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And so I'm hopeful that Eastercon's decision to use gather will mean that there will be people who have not been well served thus far who can then get something out of this convention that they haven't been able to get previously.

242
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And it will be sad if there are people for whom it's gone the other way and the conventions up now have worked great in terms of price and in terms of function.

243
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 And this one is not.

244
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 But I think as always we come back to the problem which is none of these things do everything we want at the price we want to pay.

245
00:28:45,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 And it's kind of choosing which services you want to use to get certain features and prioritizing those features over other features without kind of using 17 different platforms and making people annoyed with you because your conventions kind of so fragmented

246
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 it's impossible to relate to. And we saw that with punctuation there were people who thought we used too many platforms with punctuation even though we only really used kind of three or four.

247
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And it's a really hard problem.

248
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 So, yeah, I sympathize with the people who are not happy that they've swapped the zoom discord model for gather, but I'm hoping that that will be good for other people who might not have had fun so far.

249
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 On a point of order, I don't think that something that would work for everyone is available for any amount of money.

250
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Oh, yes, true.

251
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 I think that there aren't, there isn't some perfect solution that we're looking at and going, "Oh God, those people ran an amazing convention and if only we could afford that, we'd do that."

252
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Because I think people might go for that if it existed, but it doesn't. And I had one more thing to say, which is that they keep talking about the, you know, the surprise element and how they want it to be all lovely surprise for us.

253
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 And for me, this is a bit like saying, "Our hotel is going to be a surprise and we don't want to spoil the surprise by telling you what it's like before." And I don't think, I don't think this is how humans work.

254
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Humans like their environments to be comfortable and familiar by and large. They don't like them surprising and weird, especially not if they're spending a week at there with their friends.

255
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And I think they have overestimated the extent to which people will be excited by the surprise of it.

256
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 I think what they should have done was to have a lot of it go, "This is familiar, you're going to find it very easy. We're going to show you all how comfortable it is and then have a few things that were wildly surprising within that."

257
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 That's very true. I did not, you know, pick my hotel randomly out of a hat. I looked at some photographs first.

258
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 When also, there are, I mean, there are services where you can pick a hotel randomly out of a hat, but usually you're getting some sort of reduction in cost.

259
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 And that's the other thing, right? Like saying our convention will cost 10 times more and we're not going to tell you where the hotel is.

260
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 That is a hard sell on both fronts.

261
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 That's how we got our accommodation for Helsinki, because Helsinki accommodation was very expensive. And we basically got an apartment where they said, "It'll be somewhere somewhere in the middle of Helsinki and we won't tell you where, but it will be roughly adequate."

262
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And we weren't, that'll do for us. And it was unbelievably amazing. And right on top of the Central Bus Station, which we had a bus that took two minutes to get us to the Congressional.

263
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 It wasn't called the "Congresskabao, Mesakeskas."

264
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I would just like to add that when you do get those mystery hotel sites, it will be a four-star hotel somewhere in this area. I then reverse game them and work out exactly which hotels it would be before I pick one.

265
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 So, what works for hotels does not work for apartments?

266
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 No.

267
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And also doesn't work for popular internet platforms.

268
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 There has been a lot of very justified criticism of these to come, but I will just say that in general, although I completely recognise why people have been,

269
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 making those criticisms, I am actually quite excited. I am looking forward to Eastacom. I think it's going to be good.

270
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 I too am quite excited. And if, I think there's a tendency when you're doing like a commentary podcast that it will come over a bit as whiny. Sorry, guys.

271
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 But it's kind of amazing that they're running something that will be as much like an in-person Easter car as possible.

272
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And I think it's going to be a lot of fun. And I think people are going to be quite surprised by how much fun it is.

273
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 I think you'll need to do things to manage your screen time over the weekend.

274
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 I'm sure the convention will have thought about this and will have programmed in things that are designed to get you out of the house.

275
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 But just in case they haven't, daylight is also good.

276
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 We will be recording a live episode at Eastacom. We've asked.

277
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 So yes, the program team have said that they're going to put us in the program.

278
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 That is all I've heard. And it was provisional. So like if we're not in the program, Eastacom programming is hard.

279
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And, you know, that's entirely fair enough.

280
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 If we're not in the program, then watch our Facebook page for the detail and Twitter for the details of the Gorilla Zoom link where the live opto thought will happen.

281
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Yeah, so, you know, look out for us at Eastacom. Look out for us immediately before Eastacom.

282
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Alison, you are the UK fanzine liaison.

283
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Sorry, let me start that again. You are the UK fanzine liaison for Glasgow in 2024.

284
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 And you want to talk about it briefly.

285
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 I do want to talk about it briefly. I have a proper job on Glasgow in 2024.

286
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 So what is a fanzine liaison?

287
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Well, that's a good question, isn't it? So I don't think that fanzines can really be liaised with.

288
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 I think only people can be liaised with. And I think my job is to liaise with the sort of people who like fanzines.

289
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 I may be also a bit of the sort of people who like podcasts. So I do a podcast.

290
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 So especially people who like fanzines and podcasts, which is the total group of people who are listening, I think.

291
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 If you don't like one of fanzines or podcasts, don't write it. It's fine.

292
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 I am part of the promotions division, which means that my job is to help encourage everyone to join, to pre-support Glasgow in 2024, which is bid for an awesome world con.

293
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 I don't think that's an official line. This is going to be a feature of the things I say about Glasgow in 2024.

294
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 I'm working for Meg McDonald, who is division head for promotions.

295
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 The promotions division is huge and all encompassing because really all that you're doing when you're a bid is to encourage people to demonstrate that you're organised and pull together and people should vote for you, which they can't do yet, not for another year.

296
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 But they can pre-support or friend or super friend. So big plug for Glasgow 2024.

297
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 What this probably does mean is that when the podcast is inclined to slag off, Glasgow in 2024 will get, listen John to do that bit and not me.

298
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 Hang on, whoa, are you taking jobs with the very power structures that it's our job to hold to the fire, Alison?

299
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 Yes, and that's actually how fandom works all of the time.

300
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 I will perfect my very best Alison impression for the next time I feel inclined to complain about something Glasgow have done.

301
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Excellent.

302
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 I don't think I have complained about anything they've done yet.

303
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 So, you know, the very well managed bid at the moment. So, I mean, I'm not saying obviously things happen and stuff goes wrong, especially where world comes are concerned because, you know, things, but in general, it's very, it's a great team to work with and I'm really enjoying it.

304
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 So, I'm glad to hear it. And yes, if you're doing, if you're doing fanzies and you're kind of not sure what the relevance of what you like about fandom is to world cons, I want to talk to you about that because that's my job.

305
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Nice.

306
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 If you could also get Glasgow to buy adverts on Octa thought that would be grand.

307
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Oh, I was going to say that. Hi, Meg. If you're listening.

308
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Yes, I did tell you, I think that I was like to go off piece quite a lot. And this is an example. And Glasgow might want sponsor reads on our podcast. I think you almost said you wanted to have sponsor reads on podcast.

309
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 We'd be a great one to start with our sponsor reads are very reasonably priced and we'll get the journal list to read them out.

310
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Anyway, so.

311
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Also, anyone else who wants sponsor reads on our podcast, we've been going for a year. We have quite a lot of listeners. Apparently we could be monetizing. And we obviously only want to monetize with the sort of stuff that our listeners would like anyway.

312
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Yes, please pay us to say things that we'd probably say anyway.

313
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 That is a business model that I can get behind.

314
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 While we were recording unbound, which is a platform for getting books funded announced that they are bringing a Kickstarter to do a book called 42, the wildly improbable ideas of Douglas Adams, which will be a full color, large format, hardback featuring never before seen extracts from Douglas's archive.

315
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 I am a huge Douglas Adams and hitchhikers go to the Galaxy fan as people have known me for a while may know. And so I'm quite excited about this. So there will be a link in the show notes.

316
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 And yeah, I'll be backing when it is up on Kickstarter.

317
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 I do have a hot take on unbound. I don't like unbound. So that's the thing.

318
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Don't tell Farrah.

319
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 It was fine for Farrah's thing.

320
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Okay, so unbound takes your money and then they may never produce the book and they never give you your money back unless you explicitly write to them and ask for it.

321
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 It's like Kickstarter, right? Like you can back a Kickstarter that you never did.

322
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 If you back a Kickstarter and it isn't funded, they don't take your money. So what happens with unbound is that they just kind of leave them open going, "Oh, this poetry anthology is 9% funded and if it ever gets to 100% we'll make the book."

323
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Oh, I see what you mean.

324
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 But you pay for the book upfront. And I just think this business model is wrong. So yeah, but I mean, I have actually backed a couple of things under unbound through unbound and they've been fantastic and there's a few others that I should probably write to unbound and say, "Come on guys, it's three years. Give me my money back."

325
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 That's fair. But I think so I backed Farrah Mendelssohn's book about Robert Heinlein and I'm ready yet, but that was quite good.

326
00:38:49,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 And the thing that Andrew Hogg noticed when I posted this to a Discord was that it's interesting that unbound are choosing to bring this project through Kickstarter rather than crowdfunding it on their own crowdfunding platform.

327
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 But I suspect this is because they think it will be high enough profile that being on Kickstarter will mean that more people are aware of it and give it money.

328
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 But it is interesting.

329
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Oh, if it's actually Kickstarter then everything I said about unbound doesn't apply to this.

330
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Yes.

331
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 Why is this coming through Kickstarter? Like...

332
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 That's a good question.

333
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Basically, they think it is a... do they think it is a super niche appeal and needs to be kick started?

334
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 It seems to me that unpublished works from Douglas Adams would be a big enough deal that I'm surprised they would have to go through Kickstarter to do it.

335
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 So it may be... it may be a conscious choice that they think they will just get more pre-sales and then maybe they need the pre-sales to do a large format hardback.

336
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 But I'm interested in that.

337
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 We are definitely seeing that there are projects coming to Kickstarter that are probably projects that would succeed if they were not kick-started.

338
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 But kick-starters are a good way of building hype.

339
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 And so I think kick-starters can kind of be split into two halves, which are projects that genuinely need crowdfunding to succeed and projects which will succeed but will get more hype if they do it as a crowdfunding pay-up front model.

340
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 And this is something that's happening more and more in board games where you get board games companies who are well established and who could almost turn and just make board games and sell them.

341
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 But they go through kick-starters because if they can exploit the psychology of kind of kick-starters exclusives and if you don't back now, you won't get this model.

342
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 And then Cmon, CMON, is a board games publisher that is infamous for their predatory practice on Kickstarter.

343
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 I don't know which one of those camps on Bound falls into, but it may well be that they're doing it for the hype and kind of hoping to incentivize people through exclusives.

344
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 I will be immediately backing at the highest tier when I am able to give them my credit card details and in that case, rather part of the problem.

345
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 And also I will just say that would not be true if it was anything else but a Douglas Adams book.

346
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 I missed quite a lot of that.

347
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 I can translate.

348
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 John said, "Gosh wow, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy."

349
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 But I think the point is with board games that there is a certain amount of extras they can stick on top like you get a lot of these kick-starters for a game and then you can pledge more for the game plus the expansion or the game plus some extra miniatures, whatever.

350
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 So I'm wondering if they're going to have all these different tiers or if it's just going to be like, there's a book and if you want, you can pay more and you'll get a book and I don't know a sign book by someone else or like what are the extra things?

351
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 I mean, if it's a full colour hardback, it's a book.

352
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 I was going to say, you pay enough of the Elizabeth of the Douglas Adams signature for you from a tranche of them.

353
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 They found that he signed and left at the publishers.

354
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 It just seems strange to me that they have an entire book crowd funding platform that they launched and then it's just going to do this one on Kickstarter.

355
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Anyway, we have to wait and see when it launches.

356
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 As I say, I try not to back kick-start as at the full-amount site unseen, but this book will be probably an exception to my self-control in that area.

357
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 I'll wait till it comes out and then make a decision as to whether I want to buy it a lot.

358
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 I mean, I have literally every other Douglas Adams book, so I'm probably not going to start not having them with this.

359
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Oh, I think it probably is numbers. I think because Kickstarter, it's quite common for them to say, well, you'll get the first Kickstarter edition, but then of course it's going to be a commercial product.

360
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 And I think Unbound. It's off of that's what it is. They work out how many people want it. They print that many copies, plus a few extras in case things go wrong.

361
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 They send them out. That's it done.

362
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Maybe that's maybe that is it. Maybe it's maybe it's because they're taking a slightly different model and they're intending to sell this after the campaign.

363
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 I'm pretty sure they do sell some Unbound things after the campaign, but I can't get Amazon to load to tell me.

364
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Unbound is read a reprint of a puzzle book called Cane's Jawbone.

365
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Yes, that was what I was going to say is that I have Cane's Jawbone and I was very, very pleased to get it indeed.

366
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 Which is coming out in paperback and is available on like Waterstones and Amazon and so on as published by Unbounders.

367
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 I know about Cane's Jawbone because my friend Tim did come up with a solution, although it was apparently not the winning solution, but he was one of the people who put in a solution.

368
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 But I have the box with the cards and it is lovely.

369
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 I mean, I was very pleased to get that.

370
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 That's a very good example of something that I was very pleased to see Unbound do and it seems to me that a small scale, crown-funded publisher is the perfect way to do it.

371
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 No, and I think whatever we may think of some of the specifics of the Unbound platform, I think we all agree that a way to crowdfund nerdy books is generally a good.

372
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 And they should make it so that if you back something that's still not funded three years later, they give you your money back.

373
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 But in general, I think they are a good thing.

374
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 Yeah, and I can see they might need a bit more of a time, you know, for nerdy book, you might want it to be a bit more of a slow burn rather than having to get it all done in a month like a regular kickstart.

375
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 I'm not sure it's true. I think about it's a great time.

376
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 B.S. Right. Anyway, that was the anniversary episode of the OptiThought podcast and it's goodbye from me.

377
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 It's goodbye from me.

378
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And it's goodbye from me.

379
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 [Music]

380
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 Listeners, if you want to know which hotel you're going to be staying at next time you're in a hotel, I recommend you tweet Liz and ask her.

381
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 I'm sure she will be thrilled.

382
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 I would actually like that kind of puzzle. Don't tell people that.

383
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 That's going in the podcast Liz.

384
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 100%. My anniversary gift to you is Vibuqueen here at U with Hotel-based puzzles.
