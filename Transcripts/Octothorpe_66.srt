00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 66th episode of Octa Thorpe, the podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 15th of September 2022.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,280
 I'm John Coxen and I am bringing to you a series of recordings we made at Tricon 8.

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:26,480
 We didn't have time to record while we were travelling and so we've put this together as a sort of taster of the fanzine lounge for people who couldn't be at the convention itself.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,400
 The audio quality is therefore not quite up to our usual standard.

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:43,360
 I've cleaned it up as best I can, but there are still some audio artifacts and I will entirely understand if you listen to the first few minutes and decide to wait for next fortnight's episode.

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,320
 But sit back, relax and enjoy.

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:57,440
 [Music]

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,680
 So I'm here with noted podcast and previous Hugo Award winner, Alison Scott.

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,680
 I'm so glad you invited me to be on Octa Thorpe today John.

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,080
 I have been a big admirer of Octa Thorpe ever since, I'd say even before the first episode.

11
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,040
 Now that is true.

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:24,920
 What I want to talk to you about was the fanzine lounge, which is not so much full of fanzines, but it is not so much lads, but it's still significantly full of fanzine fans.

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,720
 It has a good, a good watch of fanzine fans in it and we're hoping that will carry on for the whole weekend.

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,120
 And I'm hoping that I could introduce new fanzine fans to the idea of making fanzines and doing fanzines on our paper.

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,040
 Oh, bugger.

16
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,520
 We have the beads of production.

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,120
 I've got to make my good thing.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,040
 And we have to make our work, yeah we're going to do, I've told.

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,920
 When is that happening?

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,600
 I've told Nigel, well, Sunday morning to 11.

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,920
 I said, so therefore, Nigel, when do you need my contribution?

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,560
 I said Sunday morning to 11.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,480
 So you'll be doing your contribution at half past ten on Sunday.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:02,400
 So if anyone, if anyone was at Worldcon at half past ten on Sunday and saw Alison,

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,360
 Matt Lee typing, you now know why that was.

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,880
 So why, what is on your head?

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,760
 Oh, on my head right now is.

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,480
 Because you are the hardest friends.

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,120
 I've learned from the best.

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,320
 I'm an incisive interview.

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,480
 How am I supposed to talk?

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,520
 Because I cannot see the top of my head.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,960
 Yeah, that's bad.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,760
 I have to.

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,320
 I could.

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,160
 Yes, you could.

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
 You could look at your phone.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
 But I have.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,240
 Well, tell me first what's on your arm or what was just on your arm.

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,200
 Indeed, indeed.

41
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,760
 This is our.

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,160
 Oh, wow.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,080
 Is it extreme?

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,240
 It's kind of like a smack bag.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,680
 What's the product type?

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,600
 I was a bottle.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:54,200
 Yeah, so so Alison is holding a Google grey polyester fleece tote that we got because we are Hugo award finalists.

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,960
 Oh, yeah, we got the Hugo one finalist got all over smack this year.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,520
 Yeah.

50
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,080
 And the swag was very excited.

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
 This was came in this big bag, which is the bag that I'm currently holding.

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,360
 It says that's very useful for cutting your shirt around the Worldcon.

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,720
 Yeah.

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:07,720
 Yeah.

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,240
 Yeah.

56
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,360
 Yeah.

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,760
 And inside that bag, what was inside the bag?

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,960
 Inside.

59
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,880
 So inside the sort of sturdy, fairly rigid polyester feast tote bag was a non sturdy.

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,000
 Actually, no, probably steady, but not rigid.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,280
 Google branded gym bag made if I would say cotton.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,080
 And what was inside that bag, Alison?

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,280
 Inside that bag was a kind of very compact nylon bag that falls out to be quite a useful bag size with zips.

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,960
 But it's actually very small inside.

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,960
 And so that was another bag inside the bag that was inside the bag.

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,040
 And inside that bag was only trite-based, stressful.

67
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
 Yeah, and a flask.

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,200
 And a flask.

69
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,280
 And inside the flask is coffee if you're just excusing it.

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,320
 For the benefit of the recording, Alison is abandoning me for coffee.

71
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,560
 It is quite nice.

72
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,760
 It's not actually not looked at the flask.

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,920
 It's solid solid.

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,280
 I haven't opened the box.

75
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,080
 It's like, and it's also cold.

76
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,040
 And yeah.

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,320
 Yeah.

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,600
 No, I mean, actually I recently broke of that.

79
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,360
 So having a replacement is a good thing.

80
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,640
 And I don't know whether so.

81
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,720
 So for those who don't know, the Hugo finalists sometimes get,

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:31,920
 or often I would say get a party favor from the next world's con who traditionally hosts the post award reception or the Hugo Losers party.

83
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
 Chengdu is hosting that reception.

84
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,240
 I don't know whether they will do party papers.

85
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,920
 They may well.

86
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,200
 I think it's too likely given that they've done party favors for everybody at the convention.

87
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,680
 I think the chances there won't be a party favor for us is quite small.

88
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,000
 Taff delegate, Fia, has just brought up.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,960
 Taff, Fia Carlson.

90
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,120
 She has blue hair and a blue top and has several ribbons.

91
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,200
 I recognize some of these ribbons.

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,400
 Would you two like to have a ribbon pissing contest?

93
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
 I know.

94
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
 I celebrate all ribbons.

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,600
 It's not a competition.

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,560
 But obviously, I ain't clogging.

97
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,520
 Hold them up, back to back.

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
 Only two.

99
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,720
 Fia is applying another ribbon.

100
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,400
 All she's applying a Glasgow ribbon.

101
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,920
 And a Seattle to a Twitch fan.

102
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,320
 I haven't got the Seattle ribbon yet.

103
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,520
 I asked Chengdu if they had ribbons and they said no.

104
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,080
 So I have not got Chengdu ribbon.

105
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,520
 Chengdu don't have ribbons.

106
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,040
 No. They have ribbons for being a Hugo voter.

107
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,800
 I put that on my badge.

108
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,280
 Fia, would you like to say things into the microphone?

109
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,800
 We are.

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
 So you can be on book to thought.

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,960
 Book to thought.

112
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,120
 Sure.

113
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,720
 How has your Taff trip been so far?

114
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,440
 Oh, it's been amazing.

115
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,560
 I have seen almost all of the East Coast and I've seen Wales.

116
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,760
 I've seen the Minnesota State Fair and I am very, very happy

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,200
 with everything that I've done.

118
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,880
 All the people that have met, you know, it's been amazing.

119
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,520
 And you have tinsel in your hair.

120
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,040
 Yeah.

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,800
 Which matches your hair, which is lovely.

122
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,320
 Yes.

123
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,960
 And we have Jerry Sullivan, who is taking a picture of Alison and Fia.

124
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,160
 Jerry also has tinsel in her hair.

125
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,880
 There was actually a Estonian band that put the tinsel on.

126
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,960
 Are we podcasting as we speak?

127
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,280
 Yes, Jerry, you are now on octopole.

128
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,080
 I love being on my picture.

129
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,240
 The science fiction and science fiction fandom.

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,520
 And I should probably give you a ribbon if you are on the board.

131
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,840
 So ribbons will happen.

132
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,640
 That's probably me.

133
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,280
 Fia will overtake me when I give her this ribbon,

134
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,040
 which I think tells you how much I value.

135
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
 Whoa.

136
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,280
 Thank you.

137
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,240
 There we go.

138
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,480
 So yes, what is on my head, I remember now, is a...

139
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,920
 Jesus Christ.

140
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
 I thought you were being funny.

141
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,600
 I didn't think you genuinely forgotten.

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,480
 LAUGHTER

143
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,200
 Is that that?

144
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,520
 Which a friend of Jerry's who I don't know, gave me?

145
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,680
 Jean Mealy.

146
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
 Yes, Jean Mealy.

147
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
 He gave me.

148
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,520
 Which says bison fuddy and has...

149
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,920
 Metal kind of bison conservation herd.

150
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,240
 Yeah, and it kind of has bisony bits.

151
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,520
 I mean, it's not quite like a moose, but it's definitely kind of horns.

152
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,760
 And I love that stuff, Matiara's.

153
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,680
 But...

154
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,760
 Elizan is a bit horny.

155
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,200
 LAUGHTER

156
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,240
 Bison is very horny right now.

157
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,560
 Listen, if you could see her, you'd know how horny she was.

158
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,760
 I think you might want...

159
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,360
 Are we going to put some photographs into this?

160
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,760
 Can I go up the look?

161
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
 You chapped her out.

162
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
 I feel like...

163
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,040
 Is there anything else you'd need to tell us?

164
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,320
 Would you like to be Baudie too, Fia?

165
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,720
 Yes.

166
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
 I grew up acting as a man.

167
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,680
 Elizan is currently making Fia horny.

168
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,240
 Um...

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,640
 L'etel, do you feel to tell what to thought about what Consilans got going on at World

170
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:18,560
 Con

171
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,360
 We plan to show some of the panels that we've recorded virtually so you can relive the experience.

172
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,680
 Um, we'll have posters of all of the exhibit space that we had.

173
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,520
 We'll be providing at least in some cases some of our famous chocolate and we're hosting

174
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,000
 a thank you party.

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,480
 It's just really a kind of a taster of the things that we would have done.

176
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,640
 And there will be this throne of key we use on which you can sit.

177
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,400
 The throne of key we use.

178
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
 Yes.

179
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,920
 You know, in the same style as Game of Thrones.

180
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,720
 So like the throne of swords.

181
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,280
 Yes, like a throne of swords.

182
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,560
 It's a thing, it's this one, softer.

183
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,880
 And it's a throne of key we use.

184
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,360
 Yeah, no, I definitely want to sit on the throne of key we use.

185
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
 Yes.

186
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,800
 And what's more is that key we love to travel as you can tell by the fact that I'm here.

187
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
 At.

188
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
 At.

189
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
 At.

190
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
 Go on, you'll remember there.

191
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
 I got it.

192
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
 I'm sorry.

193
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,600
 I'm not going to be doing three hours of sleep.

194
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
 There is nothing left in this thing.

195
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 That's amazing.

196
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,560
 Thank you ever so much for the bell.

197
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,680
 But what I would say is that yes, the throne of key we use on which one can sit is that

198
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,760
 because key we use love to travel.

199
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
 You can take one home.

200
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
 Please, please take one home.

201
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
 Right.

202
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,960
 They are they human New Zealanders.

203
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,320
 Kiwi birds or Kiwi fruit.

204
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
 Kiwi birds.

205
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
 They are soft Kiwi birds.

206
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
 They are.

207
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
 Okay.

208
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
 Okay.

209
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
 So you.

210
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
 That is very tempting.

211
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
 I will be doing that.

212
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,240
 Well, just sit on a soft Kiwi and then take one of the Kiwi's home.

213
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,560
 They're being attached or wires.

214
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,040
 So they can be removed and taken home.

215
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
 Excellent.

216
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,600
 I think I have a Kiwi from a previous convention that was like to cling on to your lanyard.

217
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,040
 I think we've still got one of those at home.

218
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
 Somewhere.

219
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
 I saw it recently.

220
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,840
 It was definitely around.

221
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,480
 But you moved recently, didn't you?

222
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
 No.

223
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
 I think we took it with us.

224
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
 I don't think it went.

225
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,960
 Look, I mean, some things did go, but not that.

226
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
 Yes.

227
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 That was special.

228
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
 And they, Kiwi's are special.

229
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
 Yes.

230
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
 You do know that they only come out at night.

231
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,440
 I did not know that.

232
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
 No, they are not too.

233
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
 Ah, okay, okay.

234
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,840
 And you have to be extraordinarily quiet in order for them to come out and.

235
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,920
 So where is the throne of Kiwis?

236
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,000
 Ah, the throne of Kiwis will be in the Konsieland, Connor box tomorrow.

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,920
 Is that during the day or during the night?

238
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,120
 During the day from one o'clock to nine o'clock tomorrow.

239
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,240
 So all the Kiwi will be asleep.

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
 Yes.

241
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
 Okay.

242
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
 Yes.

243
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,120
 That means that I'm glad that I won't be sitting on an awake Kiwi.

244
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
 No.

245
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,600
 I feel that would be, uh, disrespectful.

246
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
 Disrespect.

247
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
 Disrespect.

248
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 Indeed.

249
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:14,840
 So, Chuck, you are a Hugo Award Finalist.

250
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,560
 For the sixth time.

251
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,400
 A nice.

252
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,480
 And so you have been nominated for your work on Journey Planets.

253
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
 Yes.

254
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,360
 For, uh, some co-editing with our friend Mr Garcia.

255
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
 Yes.

256
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,760
 So for those who don't know, Journey Planets is a fan-zine.

257
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,680
 If you've heard the song Old Fan-Zine, you're familiar with some of the folk tradition around

258
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,880
 fan-zines.

259
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,520
 So which, uh, issue did you co-edit, Chuck?

260
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,320
 I was co-editor on the King Arthur issue, which led me here this year.

261
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,720
 Oh, I really love that.

262
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,720
 I also did some reviews of, uh, different modern takes on the King Arthur legend.

263
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,960
 Oh, yep, yep, yep.

264
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,040
 Once in future, I looked at once in future.

265
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,240
 I looked at, um, Libby Tedars.

266
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,440
 Very, very twisted interpretation of the Arthur legends with quite wonderful.

267
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,640
 And, uh, just basically concluded that, um, Arthur is going to morph, uh, to suit his

268
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,880
 purposes to specific times.

269
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
 Yeah.

270
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,440
 And things within specific times.

271
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
 Historicity.

272
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 Yeah.

273
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,880
 Two different Arthurian things, or maybe three on the ballot this year, right?

274
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,480
 'Cause Tracy Dion is nominated in astounding for her.

275
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
 Oh no, maybe...

276
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,560
 Now I think it's astounding, but maybe loads that I can't remember.

277
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,840
 Sorry listeners, uh, for her Arthurian kind of urban fantasy series.

278
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,120
 And, um, obviously there's the Green Knight starring Dev...

279
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
 It's out.

280
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
 Not...

281
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
 Yeah, Dev...

282
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,360
 There was at least one last year or two, I think, in the YA, right?

283
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
 Yes, yeah, that was Tracy Dion again.

284
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
 Again, so yeah.

285
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,000
 Um, but yeah, seems to be very popular, so I like it.

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,200
 We're contemplating maybe doing a follow-up about Robin Hood.

287
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 Oh!

288
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
 Looking at that from the counseling.

289
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,600
 For Americans who don't know, Robin Hood is King Arthur's son.

290
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
 Ah!

291
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 Ah!

292
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
 The one he doesn't talk about.

293
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 Yeah.

294
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,400
 Who is one in the Green Knight?

295
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,840
 The one that should have got the attention other than the one that did.

296
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
 You know what I'm saying?

297
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

298
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,080
 He's, uh, King Arthur's other son was Jesus, and he gets a lot of the, uh, a lot of the

299
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
 raves.

300
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
 I think I've got this right.

301
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
 Yeah, I think you're...

302
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
 There's no mythology, so weird.

303
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,080
 I think your scholarship is dead on there.

304
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
 Yeah.

305
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
 Uh, emphasis on the dead.

306
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
 Yeah.

307
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
 Uh, but yeah, no.

308
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
 Jenny Planet, so you're gonna win?

309
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
 I hope so.

310
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
 Aang!

311
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
 One of these years.

312
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,880
 Yeah, you know, really, really my philosophy is I'm just having fun.

313
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
 Yeah.

314
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,520
 I'm going to collaborate with Chris Garcia.

315
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
 Yeah.

316
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,760
 And, you know, you and I have gone to parties together many a year now.

317
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
 Yeah, yeah.

318
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
 For these things.

319
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,440
 We've been co-finalists together a couple times, even though now we're in separate camps

320
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
 I guess this year.

321
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
 But no, competing.

322
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
 Not competing.

323
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
 We're in different categories.

324
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
 That is correct.

325
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,760
 Um, but for me it's just a, it's just kind of good fun to communicate.

326
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
 Yeah.

327
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,920
 We're gonna talk, Alison and I are gonna talk about that tomorrow afternoon in five fanzines.

328
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,240
 You know why people can get involved in them, why they should get involved in them.

329
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,360
 Uh, how it helps facilitate communication and fandom.

330
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
 Yeah.

331
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
 And, um, yeah.

332
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,520
 So I'm just, I'm not really award minded.

333
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,760
 I'm really kind of right in on Chris Garcia's coattails to tell the truth, you know.

334
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,800
 Because Journey planned as you know is one huge village and they're very insistent on

335
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,160
 including everyone that provides editorial content during the year within the general

336
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
 umbrella of finalists.

337
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,000
 No, and like working with Chris and James is amazing because they have so many ideas,

339
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 so much energy.

340
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,760
 And it's nice to kind of like tap into that.

341
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,080
 It's almost like, I feel like it must be like when you hook a house up to the national group

342
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,720
 for the first time and you just get like all that electricity.

343
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
 That's a fan.

344
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,240
 Well, spend you did a cover, did a cover for one of our, really, our drink tank.

345
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,800
 Cause I also wrote them on drink tank.

346
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,120
 And she put both, she did very nice illustrations of the both of us.

347
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,160
 And Chris was hovering in the air and having grand plans about taking over the world.

348
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,240
 And I'm standing down on the ground going, no, no, something like, no, no, I need to bring

349
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
 him to earth.

350
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,200
 I need to concentrate that energy in a very much described relationship.

351
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
 So she's been paying attention.

352
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
 Ah, yeah.

353
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,520
 So you know what people sometimes say, where do you get your ideas from?

354
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,200
 The answer is, Chris and James.

355
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,560
 I mean, they have a lot of ideas.

356
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
 They have a lot.

357
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
 They do, they do.

358
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
 They do.

359
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,280
 And they often ask us for ideas and we go, what do you think?

360
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
 Yeah.

361
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,480
 Well, that's how I got to edit my first study plan.

362
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,480
 Like Chris and James were like, we want to do a Star Wars issue and they brought a couple

363
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,960
 of people on for someone like, had to bow out and I ended up doing layout because Chris

364
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,760
 had some stuff going on.

365
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,320
 And then because most of the time Chris does layout, but the ones I've edited, I've done

366
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,000
 layout to give him like some time.

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,760
 And also because I like doing layouts.

368
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
 He loves doing layouts.

369
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
 Yeah.

370
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,000
 And he loves doing the art.

371
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,920
 He doesn't love doing the copy editing and the wordsmithery at all.

372
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,440
 And he just came to me and said, work with me, you know, because I think our skills with

373
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,360
 the mesh wall together, you can do the wordsmith and the copy editing and I'll go do the

374
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,760
 stuff I like, you know, so quite a deal.

375
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
 Yeah.

376
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,200
 Well, that's kind of how collaboration works really.

377
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
 Absolutely.

378
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,320
 That's how the collaboration works a lot to look.

379
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,640
 I took bollocks and John edits it.

380
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,800
 Yes, that is correct.

381
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,720
 And Liz gives us accurate content that is, you know, worth listening to.

382
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,400
 And we basically fill in around Liz's golden nuggets.

383
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
 I think.

384
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
 Wow.

385
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
 Wow.

386
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
 I'm pretty sure.

387
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,720
 So Liz, when you hear this, let me know if you agree with that analysis.

388
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,240
 Because you'll be hearing this in the edit.

389
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
 Hi, Liz.

390
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,320
 So you're John Clarkson editor to the bolsters.

391
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
 Something like that.

392
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
 Edit so much to the what?

393
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
 Bolsters.

394
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
 Is that a bullet?

395
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,520
 Well, he is one of the bullet providers, I think.

396
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
 Yes.

397
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,440
 I provide both of the bollocks of.

398
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,240
 So you're both a provider editor.

399
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,040
 I'm like, they are just one of the blokes.

400
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
 Okay.

401
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,640
 I'm one of the blokes I have been referred to by.

402
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,840
 But he is seeming more than this one.

403
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
 As one of the blokes.

404
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,560
 And I don't know who the other bloke is.

405
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,120
 But I'd love to meet him.

406
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,800
 Other bloke, if you're listening, please get in touch.

407
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,280
 Show up for a podcast.

408
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
 Yeah.

409
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
 Other bloke.

410
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
 God.

411
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,840
 This is the first time we've had multiple bollocks on our own.

412
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,560
 No, this is the first time we've had more than two bollocks on our own.

413
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,880
 Oh, you'll get nothing but bollocks for me.

414
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,120
 So you're in good shape today.

415
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
 Yeah.

416
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
 Yeah, I think that's right.

417
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
 Because we've had every.

418
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
 Yeah, we've had one.

419
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,720
 Oh, no, one Nicholas Williams appeared in the background.

420
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 No, no, no, no, no.

421
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,480
 And we did have quite a lot of interjection from the audience at Easter.

422
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,520
 I think you'll find we had quite a lot of ejaculations from the audience.

423
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,680
 I think that might be right.

424
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,880
 You're lowering the tone again.

425
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,040
 No, I wouldn't.

426
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,440
 Yeah, you won't.

427
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:53,240
 To be fair, we did start with you being morning, so long.

428
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,160
 Expectioned, a noted podcaster has arrived.

429
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,600
 Have I arrived?

430
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,800
 I mean, in my heart and in my vicinity, yes.

431
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,600
 So you haven't mentioned the fact that in this era of COVID, we don't have to worry

432
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
 about plosives or.

433
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,400
 Yeah, we're all wearing pop filters.

434
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
 Yeah, it's great.

435
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,960
 Everyone is so audio ready at this invention.

436
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
 I don't know what.

437
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,040
 But every time I meet anyone, it's like you're already wearing your pop filter.

438
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,760
 It's pretty on so many levels.

439
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,360
 I should have happened years ago, although I haven't ever done recording a podcast.

440
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,600
 Although I did get interviewed by Chris Garcia for the hard copy podcast, which was only

441
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,840
 available on cassettes.

442
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,920
 Yes, I have some more.

443
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,480
 I ripped all of them to MP3s to make a boot there.

444
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
 He hates that.

445
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
 I know.

446
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,680
 And then I sent them to him to spite him.

447
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,240
 Over and over again.

448
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
 Oh, you're big.

449
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
 I am.

450
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
 He keeps them all too.

451
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
 Hi, Chris.

452
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,480
 No, I was just waving at the microphone, which in this case is Chris.

453
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,760
 Rick is also a fan cast person.

454
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,560
 And you have a panel this week.

455
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,000
 I'm out on a podcast called fanboy.

456
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Yeah, fanboy.

457
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Yeah, fanboy.

458
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,760
 So I really feel like you've still each stolen parts of my podcast.

459
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,080
 So can you tell me about your podcast?

460
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,920
 We've been doing it for about 700 episodes.

461
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,560
 And for a while, we were doing it along with the BBC, actually.

462
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
 Oh, no.

463
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,520
 It's the late license show over here on the BBC.

464
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,160
 That was my-- the owner of fanboy's line, the other in chief, Derek McCall.

465
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,280
 And we basically-- you start off by just getting together and doing a live podcast in a comic

466
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,360
 book shop on the drop day of the week when we moved to Mutsra.

467
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,960
 Oh, that's a really good idea.

468
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
 Yeah, yeah.

469
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
 It's a really good idea.

470
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
 I really did.

471
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
 I did 700 episodes ago, John.

472
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
 Yeah, yeah.

473
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,280
 We don't do it that way anymore.

474
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,640
 I love ambient sound.

475
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,520
 I love background sound.

476
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,080
 It makes it a little hard to edit because you can really tell where they come.

477
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,000
 It really does make a difference, especially things about context.

478
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,760
 But if you're listening to something where you expect the background noise and it isn't

479
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 there, it's very, very off-putting.

480
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
 So it's weird.

481
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,840
 And that's why at the beginning of this episode, we have like the warnings saying there's ambient

482
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,920
 noise because I'm sure some of you listeners are experiencing that in reverse right now

483
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,680
 because usually we are in pristine recording studios.

484
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,040
 We all have an extension to our house, which is--

485
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,400
 You have like baffle boards all over the place.

486
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,600
 I'm sure there's strategic like ways to--

487
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 Yeah, yeah, definitely.

488
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,680
 And obviously later we'll go to Walgreens and get a bunch of egg boxes and like staple

489
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,760
 them to things to like further dead in the noise.

490
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,120
 I know they'll be plastic in the US, won't they?

491
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,920
 I don't know if that would work.

492
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,920
 I once saw a guy who had to do voiceover work, he was in a hotel room and he couldn't

493
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,920
 find a good place to record his voiceover stuff because you want nothing in the background.

494
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,760
 But he ended up taking a sofa, standing it on its end, putting the cushions up against

495
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,240
 the walls we had like this little concave fiber box.

496
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
 Yeah.

497
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
 And it worked.

498
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,480
 I mean if I need to record in a hotel room, I feel like I would just get a duvet and

499
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,560
 drape it over myself.

500
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,800
 But like I think the sofa solution is more elegant if you have a sofa.

501
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,080
 Yes.

502
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:23,480
 So John, how thoroughly do you get to customize your lightsaber?

503
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,000
 Do you get to customize every little bit of it?

504
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,520
 Or is it just like there's like 10 different lightsabers and you get one at once?

505
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
 Have you done it as well?

506
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
 I know.

507
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
 Yeah.

508
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,280
 So you get Liz Barry noted podcaster has joined us.

509
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,040
 Liz, do you want to tell us a bit about your voiceover?

510
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
 A bit about yourself?

511
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
 Hello.

512
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
 Is Darcy your question?

513
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
 I'm Liz.

514
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
 I'm going to get closer to Mike.

515
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,040
 I've got a terrible microphone.

516
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
 There's a blend.

517
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
 Sometimes I do a podcast.

518
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
 What's your podcast called?

519
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
 It's called Octa Thor.

520
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
 I don't know.

521
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
 That's the same as ours.

522
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
 That's the microphone when you say that Liz.

523
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
 Come on now.

524
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,040
 Don't you just get, don't just days at John.

525
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,440
 Look, I've got to tell, I've got to tell the listeners that I'm basically being very distracted

526
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,200
 here because Alice and is wearing a vise and hat.

527
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
 She is horny.

528
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,040
 I've remarked to fond this for the podcast.

529
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 But Alice and then made fear horny.

530
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,200
 Would you like me to make you horny as well Liz?

531
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
 I'm good.

532
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
 It's a thank you.

533
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 This is going to be a brilliant edit job for you.

534
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
 I'm just going to let you know that's fantastic.

535
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:33,640
 But yeah, on the subject of lightsabers, you choose one of four themes and they are protection

536
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,960
 and justice, power and control.

537
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
 Is this sort of spoiler for the lightsaber experience?

538
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,960
 Well, not really because you have to choose it themed before you go into the room.

539
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,960
 I can't remember what the others are, but there are four.

540
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,600
 Basically, they can be roughly split into a prequel type blade, which is a very old

541
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,360
 public art deco style, an original trilogy/sequel style, which is much more kind of industrial

542
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,080
 looking, and then a kind of dark side style, which is blacks and very, very sleek.

543
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,560
 And then a kind of elemental style where you can, if you want, have a rank or two on the

544
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
 end, which is dope.

545
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,120
 And then you choose from pieces from that theme.

546
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,400
 What's really awesome about it is it's very authentic to the Jedi culture and that you

547
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,280
 go on a web page ahead of time and choose all these side unseen and they deliver all

548
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,520
 the pieces not unlike that you would get your food into cafeteria set before you and

549
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
 then assemble.

550
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
 Yeah.

551
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,000
 And it was fun.

552
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 I liked it a great deal.

553
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,840
 I mean, I assume, so like, did you do it at Orlando or at LA?

554
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,640
 We didn't know our essentials here.

555
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

556
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
 Yeah, yeah.

557
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
 No, that makes sense.

558
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,760
 I assume it's like, I don't actually know because I've not been to both yet, but the

559
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,680
 attentive listener will notice the use of the word "yet" in that sense.

560
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,400
 But I assume the parts are carbon copies of one another.

561
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
 I assume that they're...

562
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
 The same.

563
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,760
 Every reason believe what they are.

564
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,640
 So by an interesting scene.

565
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
 But yeah, no.

566
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,560
 And you kind of like get a man at the front in our case who does a kind of almost like

567
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,800
 a one man show and it's all very well acted and set dressed and there's music and lighting.

568
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,320
 Very special and safe route.

569
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,800
 Yeah, it's very good.

570
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,640
 And he said with, what did he say?

571
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,280
 We tell that our eyesabers and he's like, "These are weapons and they are powerful

572
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:37,640
 weapons and with great power comes a need not to drop great power on the ground."

573
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
 Yes.

574
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
 And we were like, "That is a good point.

575
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,960
 So you also get a very, very phone case to put your basically 36 inch light bulb attached

576
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,960
 to a heavy bit of metal on so that it does not break."

577
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,240
 You wear it on your back all the way the rest of the day in the park and who looks like

578
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,800
 they're going fly fishing?

579
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 Yes.

580
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

581
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 And you get a pin?

582
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
 You get a free pin?

583
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
 Great.

584
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,760
 And it's a strange new meaning for what I was not previously familiar with.

585
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,400
 How much do we cost in Orlando?

586
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,800
 That's 220 plus tax.

587
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,840
 Whoa, it's gone up.

588
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,920
 But that's why you should do it in Orlando because sales tax is low.

589
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
 Well, it's okay.

590
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,360
 It's like, with my buy nothing it has to hold you.

591
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,240
 Oh no, it's a wall decoration.

592
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,560
 So it'll take almost no room.

593
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,400
 My son got the dark saber.

594
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,120
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

595
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:35,120
 Yeah, because you can get like free-built versions that are actually from the cannons.

596
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,120
 Yes, sir.

597
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:49,160
 I'm sat here with Perry Minow is noted Australian fan, podcaster, past WorldCon chair and wearer

598
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
 of excellent t-shirts.

599
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
 How are you, Perry?

600
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,120
 I'm very well, thank you very much.

601
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,080
 On the live.

602
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,520
 Hey! Which is a bit of a shock after 29 hours.

603
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,320
 And for those who don't know, Perry is one of the two co-hosts of the two chairs talking

604
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
 broadcast.

605
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,400
 Yes, poor old David's not here, but he's not travelling very much these days.

606
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,240
 So there we go.

607
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,960
 I think we've mentioned it previously.

608
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,040
 We have definitely mentioned the class don't stop, yes.

609
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
 Yes, you have.

610
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
 Thank you very much.

611
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
 Much appreciated.

612
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,600
 And it's a really good format because it's like kind of a very kind of world-comprospective

613
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,960
 on the science fiction canon and kind of what's kind of coming out and things like that,

614
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
 which I really like.

615
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,600
 And Perry also does a fancy.

616
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
 Yes, I do.

617
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,960
 You can probably get hold off by, I don't know, googling Perry Middle and it's a following.

618
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,480
 Well, it's all on the tour on Efansines.com, of course.

619
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,080
 We should choutefansines.com.

620
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
 Yes.

621
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,560
 One of the great, fan-ish websites in history.

622
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
 Yeah.

623
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,360
 So Bill Burns isn't at this convention, but if we do the Sogality's to come, which doesn't

624
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,640
 sound like a totally different idea, Bill will be there and we can do it.

625
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
 Oh, yeah, just talk to him.

626
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
 Yeah.

627
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
 You'll be there for his.

628
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
 He's very good.

629
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
 And good as they would be.

630
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
 Yes.

631
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,480
 He stays in my house every year when Bill and Mary come to UK and they stay with us

632
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
 in the week.

633
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,480
 And we absolutely love it because I kind of sit bill down and I go, "So what's new is

634
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
 it's called?"

635
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
 The class of the tables.

636
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,520
 And he tells me like, "There's just seven fascinating stories about the way in which

637
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,200
 fits the metal, the managed of the ocean."

638
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
 Well, he's got the whole lot.

639
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,880
 He's got, he's a central point.

640
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,600
 Just saves all of us massive amounts of time and energy being able to deposit it if you

641
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,240
 want to use that term.

642
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,040
 At the fans' hands, he makes it all available.

643
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
 People can just download it for free.

644
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,120
 And at the same time, he's like, "I quite like the software, port and our transcripts."

645
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,440
 And I quite like the use of the word deposit because I feel like Evandines is in some

646
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,680
 way the library of record for San Spectrum Bandum.

647
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,240
 So you deposit your artefact with them in much the same way you do with the British

648
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,440
 Library if you're a novelist.

649
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,920
 So that makes me happy.

650
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,440
 Well, one of the things that is interesting about Australia is that if you produce a publication

651
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,600
 like a small fanzier like I do, I have to deposit a copy of it into the National Library.

652
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,280
 And so I have to put a copy in there.

653
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,440
 And once it goes into the National Library of Australia, it gets spread around to the

654
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,920
 other state libraries as well.

655
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,680
 So they can all pick it up.

656
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,640
 So there's extra copies there.

657
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,040
 The good thing about this thing is that back in the 70s and 80s, everything was very ephemeral.

658
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
 It all disappeared.

659
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,800
 And now it's all available forever.

660
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
 Yeah.

661
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,280
 Noted fan and Fandy Van James Baker has arrived.

662
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,000
 Oh, another ex world god chair.

663
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Hello James.

664
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Ex Worlde.

665
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And Fandy editor and Hugo Award finalist.

666
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Thanks, John.

667
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Thanks, Alison.

668
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And how are you?

669
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Very.

670
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,480
 Great to see you here at the Worlde Khan in Chicago.

671
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
 Indeed.

672
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,200
 We do a load of VoxPods that we're going to register to a podcast later.

673
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
 That's fantastic.

674
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,920
 And James has a medal that says, "Try on a committee."

675
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:02,080
 That's right because I'm on the committee here, unfortunately, for my sins.

676
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,120
 I volunteered.

677
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,760
 I have not yet learned not to volunteer.

678
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,600
 You've done your time.

679
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
 Yeah.

680
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
 You've been a chair.

681
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 That's it.

682
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,600
 I mean, it's time to come back and do it twice.

683
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
 Yeah, exactly.

684
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
 And that's it.

685
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
 I'm not doing it anymore.

686
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
 I've done a couple of people who have done it twice.

687
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,840
 So, bin stockety, very middle miss.

688
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
 Yes.

689
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
 Nicely used to crack.

690
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
 Yeah.

691
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
 Colin Harris.

692
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
 Yeah.

693
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
 Two older people.

694
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,640
 I mean, when I say older, I mean going back for a...

695
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,640
 Way back.

696
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
 Yeah, for like a little cotch.

697
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
 No, I don't think so.

698
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,200
 Oh, I remember I just remember I just remember this four.

699
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,280
 There was one guy that did it twice on his own.

700
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
 His chair.

701
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
 His old chair.

702
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
 Mine.

703
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,480
 And what did one chair on my own and one cotch chair?

704
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
 Yeah.

705
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
 OK.

706
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
 So that's a great anecdote that you can better...

707
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,480
 If you can round that and get the right decals.

708
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
 Listen, it's a hook for comments.

709
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
 It's a great hook for lots.

710
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
 It is.

711
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,280
 So James, why don't you next one then?

712
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,560
 Yeah, so I would have liked to have chaired at a little roll time because the first one

713
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
 is very existential.

714
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,840
 You know, you approach it learning so much and not knowing.

715
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
 Yeah, yeah.

716
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,800
 So it's quite an interesting challenge.

717
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:21,560
 You're deploying new skills every 10 minutes and you're trying to learn and understand and

718
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:27,840
 comprehend and, you know, reflect on your own mistakes as you proceed ahead at such high

719
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
 speed.

720
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 Yeah.

721
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,360
 And I think the second one next will be based on experience.

722
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,200
 But what Vincent Daugherty has said to me is that, you know, also you're experienced

723
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,440
 and therefore you sort of realize that the effort, time and energy it takes is not in

724
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
 substantial.

725
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
 No.

726
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,520
 You know, there were certain things I did to be a World Cup chair for me.

727
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,400
 So I lost weight.

728
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,880
 I tried to be fit.

729
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,680
 I tried to make sure that my fitness levels were fine.

730
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,120
 They're not sort of at the necessary pace.

731
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
 OK, thanks.

732
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
 That's kind.

733
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,960
 Not that in any way this is about me.

734
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,440
 So this was about me becoming fit because obviously I had known some people previously

735
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,360
 who were unwell and my own father had his first heart attack when he was 38.

736
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
 Yeah.

737
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,600
 So bearing in mind that I was past that threshold and I was approaching the age where he had

738
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,600
 a quadruple bypass, fitness was important to me, which is mad.

739
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,280
 But when you're working on a World Cup for maybe 16 hours in a day, you need that sort

740
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
 of energy.

741
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,920
 Well, it's good to have that extra bit in the back pocket and I was in charge of that

742
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,240
 so it was good times but hard work.

743
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
 Would I do it again?

744
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,600
 Yes, I would love to this week.

745
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
 No.

746
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
 That's fair.

747
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
 I mean, that is reasonable.

748
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,640
 See, I told you, if you do a World Cup, you become a World Cup chair, send your man.

749
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,680
 So mad that you think you could actually approach another one.

750
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
 That's how mad you become.

751
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,720
 It does remind me of the way people talk about shoulders, actually.

752
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,920
 Probably right.

753
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,200
 So, but there is a WN-239 bit.

754
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
 Yes.

755
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
 So you must be very excited about it.

756
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
 Oh, super excited.

757
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,480
 And I think that's one of the greatest things about being a World Cup chair.

758
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,160
 It's not that the World Cup was a good time.

759
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,240
 You know, we got a few things wrong.

760
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,800
 We got thousands of things right.

761
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,320
 It's the way it works.

762
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:22,080
 But I hope that the team who were very full of enthusiasm and who really enjoyed running

763
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,440
 the World Cup go on now and I can maybe give them a couple of pointers, at least tell them

764
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,400
 not to try to make the mistakes I made and watch them go on and succeed in 29.

765
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,960
 And Brian Neswitt and Marguerite Smith are running down at the moment.

766
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,760
 And basically, it's early days.

767
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,440
 It's a long way away.

768
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,520
 But they're following the similar path that 2019 had.

769
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,080
 So they're, they've obviously got a timeline in mind.

770
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,880
 And I'm really enjoying watching on and not really doing too much.

771
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 Yeah.

772
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,480
 And it's great for everyone in Europe to have more European World Cups.

773
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,800
 Like I think it's really good to have Ireland and Finland kind of joining the community

774
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,040
 of countries that can kind of, you know, run a convention maybe every decade.

775
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,520
 And then you get that kind of much more international flavour to the convention.

776
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
 So it is amazing.

777
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
 And it's really, really good.

778
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
 Yeah.

779
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
 So it's really quite interesting.

780
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,840
 As a smart con, we did a little exercise to see ten other venues around the world which

781
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,120
 could work including Lisbon.

782
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,080
 And you know, one of the venues we didn't look at was the venue that Capcom were looking

783
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,080
 at.

784
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,080
 And that was quite amazing.

785
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,680
 So the idea that there could be a Ugandan World Cup which in its Rome right will face

786
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
 challenges.

787
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,840
 You know, they will have their own challenges to deal with.

788
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,000
 But the idea of the concept of an African World Cup is very exciting.

789
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,200
 And as we know now, we have a number of beds hopefully coming from the continent which

790
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
 is vast.

791
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
 It's a huge place.

792
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,160
 Like Ireland is the same size as Maine.

793
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,880
 And then alone, you know, so you know, there's a wonderful potential there.

794
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
 So yeah.

795
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,600
 I think that's great.

796
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,840
 And I look forward actually to watching helping a little bit and watching Albert Glasgow.

797
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,440
 Watching people develop and it's really fun.

798
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,640
 And then Brisbane is bidding for 2028, Perry.

799
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
 I believe so.

800
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,960
 Yes, that's correct.

801
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
 And you're not caring for a third time.

802
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,400
 You're not going to be becoming the third first person to do.

803
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,760
 I am absolutely not cheering.

804
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,280
 I would not have a life nor would I have a marriage left.

805
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,960
 I think I decided to go down that path.

806
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,960
 So no, I've done my dash, I think.

807
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,240
 Time for other people to do that.

808
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,080
 Plus, I'll be in my 70s and two or more.

809
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,720
 It's one of those things that it's not necessarily a really young person's game.

810
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,240
 But you've got to be, as James was saying, you've got to be in that period where you're

811
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,560
 not only physically but pretty mentally fit as well.

812
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,640
 You start getting up in your 70s and now you start to fade.

813
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
 And you know, you're...

814
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
 It's a bit like a game.

815
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,640
 Yes.

816
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,200
 You need the experience and managerial experience with people and projects to be able to do

817
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,640
 it so you need enough level of that.

818
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
 Yeah.

819
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,040
 But you don't want to go so far that you're so stuck in the mud, you don't want to change.

820
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,160
 And that's where things...

821
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,080
 My aim is to go from being too young to chair a world con to too old to chair a world con

822
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,640
 without ever going through the middle bed.

823
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,200
 That's an interesting...

824
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,360
 I think it's an excellent choice to do everything.

825
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,120
 Am I allowed to say damn you?

826
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:35,880
 Thank you very much to Harry and James to chair Storke.

827
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,720
 Hello again everyone.

828
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:45,200
 It's John back in England again with his Good Mike and the lack of audio artifacts.

829
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:54,160
 I hope you enjoyed that short taste of Tricon 8 and I will see you next week for the next

 episode of OctaThorp.

831
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,240
 But until then, it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from everyone else who talked to us

832
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,480
 in this episode.

 [Music]

834
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,920
 Stephen has very kindly brought coffee for which I'm very grateful.

835
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
 Thank you Stephen.

836
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,080
 He'll hear this later when it goes out.

837
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,960
 Because we didn't say thank you when he actually brought the coffees because we were brought

838
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
 up badly.

839
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
 Sorry mum and dad.

840
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,760
 You raised me better than that.

841
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,560
 I kind of nodded at him.

842
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,120
 Which is, you know...

843
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,280
 Surely being married to you is thanks enough.

844
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,400
 Like I feel like I should have said thank you but you probably imply...

845
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,240
 Wait, look at him in a small drink.

846
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
 A smoldering.

847
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
 A smoldering.

848
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
 I was horny, look.

849
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,240
 Oh yeah, for this is what I'm doing.

850
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,240
 That's what I'm doing.

851
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,240
 That's what I'm doing.

852
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,240
 And now the chronology of these recordings.

853
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
 Alison is still horny.

854
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,240
 She was up going off bison on him.

855
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
 Yup.

856
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
 Indeed.
