1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
 Don't worry, John, I'm here to tell you you're wrong,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,700
 even if Liz isn't stepping up to the plate.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,340
 Yeah, you might want to record that one for future reference.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:26,340
 Hello, everyone, and welcome to the 48th episode of OctoThorp,

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,220
 the podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,260
 which is coming to you on the 6th of January 2022.

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,620
 I'm John Coxon.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,140
 I'm Alison Scott.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,340
 And I'm Liz Batty.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,300
 And we have a letter of common from Fara.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,860
 And it says here in the show notes, but what did you think of

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,180
 Discon 3?

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,940
 What?

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,220
 What did we think of Discon 3 people?

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,460
 I quite liked it.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,860
 I'm looking forward to the programme being on catch up because there were some items I missed or I was double booked for.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,300
 And there are items I would quite like to go back and watch.

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,940
 And I think it is, I think it's actually really good that they didn't have the programme for catch up over Christmas

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,660
 because I would have watched precisely zero programme over Christmas.

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,820
 And I know that they're only going to be putting up for a limited time.

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,500
 So if that limited time starts after I am not super busy with Christmas,

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 I think that is only a great thing.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,980
 So congratulations for Discon 3 for that excellent planning.

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,620
 And I'm looking forward to it all coming online so I can do some watching.

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,020
 Yeah, I saw a few items.

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,500
 I missed vastly more because I was 12 hours out of sync,

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,540
 which meant there were maybe two or three programme items in time.

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,980
 So that's when I would normally be awake.

29
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,700
 So I watched like one or two items per day.

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,780
 I hung around in the discord a bit.

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,420
 I missed some items I would have liked to watch because they happened to be at times.

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,820
 I was awake, but in rooms, which were having problems with their streaming, which was a bit unfortunate.

33
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,980
 Yeah, but generally what I saw, I quite enjoyed.

34
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,100
 I saw some great panels.

35
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,660
 I saw some panels, which were kind of excellent descriptions that went quite rumbly and vague.

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,420
 I went to some panels where I read the description, thought I'll give this go

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,620
 and it turned out it wasn't my thing.

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,860
 So I tried something else.

39
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,380
 Yeah, we went back and discord.

40
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,860
 I think I went to one party, which was not a party.

41
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,140
 It was Alison's Let's Have Coffee Moose in a Zoom.

42
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,060
 And we got a tour of the hotel at like six in the morning, which is very nice.

43
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,460
 So yeah, I mean, I had a nice time, but I can't really say I saw much of the convention

44
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,860
 just because I was asleep for most of the time was happening.

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,180
 So I went to the convention virtually for five solid days.

46
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,500
 I had not been intending to do this because I'd been expecting to have Christmas

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,340
 things over the that weekend.

48
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,060
 And in fact, they all got cancelled.

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,700
 So I got five days at this con, which was great.

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,860
 I really enjoyed myself virtually.

51
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,300
 I had a lovely time talking to people from all over the world.

52
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,580
 And that was really, really good.

53
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,740
 And some of them are now kind of cafe moose regulars.

54
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,460
 And that's nice.

55
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,860
 And I think they did a really, really good job of spinning up the virtual side

56
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,780
 very quickly, more or less in, I think, the last month before the convention.

57
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,740
 And given that, I think they did fantastically well with it.

58
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,900
 And there was lots of good stuff.

59
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,900
 I do have quite a lot of takeaways about how to run virtual and hybrid events.

60
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,020
 I think my biggest is picking up on what Liz said.

61
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,860
 I think if we're charging $75 for a virtual membership, then the ability to

62
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,580
 time shift the program items in real time needs to be part of that and part of

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,780
 the planning from the beginning.

64
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,500
 For another time, I understand why this con didn't do it, but I think

65
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,660
 Wilcons should have that as kind of the starting point, because it's not just about

66
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,220
 having the program and being able to watch it later.

67
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,900
 It's about being able to talk to people about the stuff that you're seeing on the

68
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,580
 program in the social spaces over the weekend.

69
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,620
 That's what we do at conventions, right?

70
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,860
 We see program and then we talk about program to our mates.

71
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,620
 And that's the key thing we need to enable.

72
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,140
 And then the other point is that when we have these hybrid conventions, we seem to

73
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,380
 have two conventions going on, one, one of which is a virtual convention happening

74
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,820
 in Zoom and Discord around the place.

75
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,660
 And one is the actual physical convention.

76
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,620
 And I don't think we're doing enough yet.

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,380
 This is not a criticism of Discord because we've only just begun.

78
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,180
 I don't think we're doing enough yet to link up those two events so that people feel

79
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,100
 they're at both of them.

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,820
 But they're actually getting the benefit of the physical convention.

81
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,420
 In the virtual spaces.

82
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,540
 And so the people in the physical convention also recognized that there are fans who are

83
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,020
 their friends and who have things to offer in the virtual spaces as well.

84
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,540
 Those are, so those are my big two, two big takeaways from DiscCon.

85
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,980
 Really enjoy myself.

86
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,380
 Had a great time, was then very behind for the next three weeks.

87
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,820
 My big takeaway from DiscCon was sushi.

88
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,900
 I had a large amount of sushi.

89
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,300
 I did not book enough takeaways.

90
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,340
 I think I know now that you, one of the nice things about virtual

91
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,020
 conventions is ordering your food in.

92
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,980
 And I should have done more of that.

93
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,940
 We did a little bit and I did not cook or do anything like that.

94
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,500
 I just got looked after by my lovely and very long suffering family again.

95
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,940
 Or as you like to call them, gophers.

96
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,980
 It's certainly true that when I take a role on a convention,

97
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,380
 I generally discourage Stephen from taking a role on the same convention

98
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,260
 so that he could be like my personal aid for the weekend.

99
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,860
 Every so often he gets one of these hero of the convention awards for doing this

100
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,980
 because other people don't.

101
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,420
 Brilliant.

102
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,140
 He's the best.

103
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,620
 I love you.

104
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,740
 I love you darling.

105
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,380
 I mean, I know you don't listen to the podcast, but you know.

106
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:32,780
 What?

107
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,740
 This is an outrage.

108
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,020
 He does sometimes.

109
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,780
 So yes, generally speaking quite positive, I think, on DiscCon.

110
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,620
 What I also want to say about DiscCon is they did have some items which started,

111
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,420
 well, they would have been very early in the morning in the US.

112
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,100
 They were early evening for me, but these were part of their quite extensive stream of

113
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,740
 items on African science fiction and fantasy, which they were obviously running at times

114
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,060
 that were more suited to the participants who were nearly all on the ones I saw virtual

115
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,540
 and actually joining from Africa.

116
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,060
 So I think there was a real strength that they could do that,

117
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,460
 that they could have all these virtual participants who could not make it to the con for financial

118
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,500
 or the reasons, but they can actually now join in and they were also available for viewing on site.

119
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 And I'd be really interested to know whether people who had the opportunity to view the virtual

120
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,900
 panels on site went to them or whether they sort of saved those up for later viewing because

121
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,060
 they knew they would be recorded and available later.

122
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,140
 So I think that's an interesting thing from hybrid conventions.

123
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,180
 If you allow people to watch virtual participants, do they actually go or do they decide, well,

124
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,340
 actually, if it's just going to be four people over Zoom, I could easily watch that later on in

125
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,340
 the comfort of my own home. I'll go to ones that aren't being streamed where the people are actually

126
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,180
 on site. So let us know, just gone, attendees, what happened?

127
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:53,180
 We do know from much smaller conventions, SmothCon and Corfloo, that some people do go and people

128
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,940
 also quite like to watch virtual events from their hotel room. So the number of, the report

129
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,820
 back from Discon was that virtual events were not well, the virtual events that was

130
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,380
 streamed into the convention were not well attended, but I don't think we necessarily know

131
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,660
 the full extent of how that doesn't necessarily mean they're not popular.

132
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,700
 Yeah, that's fair.

133
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,260
 Yeah.

134
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,300
 And also, Doug Form tasks us, what are your thoughts on Christmas music and the WorldCon

135
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,900
 opening ceremony? And mine were, I love Christmas carols to bits, you know, I love all sorts of

136
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,980
 Christmas music including a lot of religious Christmas music. And I thought this was way out

137
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,820
 of order and I don't think the excuse that that happened to be what the local choir had prepared

138
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:41,180
 for Christmas. And so therefore, that was what they had was quite adequate because I don't think

139
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,140
 they should have done that. I think it raised eyebrows and made people feel excluded and happy.

140
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,980
 And I think having a program of Christmas music that might have included one religious

141
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,140
 piece of Christmas music would have been fine, but I think it was a bit, a bit much.

142
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:00,380
 As my pals though, I have a Christmas list with thousands of carols on it. I have hundreds of

143
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,580
 versions of some carols, I love them. So yeah, I still didn't think they should have done it.

144
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,860
 The problem here is obviously that we didn't give our picks for SF no Christmas songs until

145
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,100
 after this Com3. So really, we do have to date full responsibility and we apologise to the

146
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,940
 wider science-rich community. Yeah, I mean, I'm guessing it was just one of the things where

147
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,660
 where the choir went right. It's Christmas. This is our busiest time of year. Here's our

148
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,540
 like set of possible songs and then it's come some compromise where this call said either,

149
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,340
 okay, well, just do one song at this opening ceremony then or where they try to range with

150
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,820
 them to learn something else. But I can understand they're having been in choir at Christmas. You

151
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,220
 have the set of stuff you're learning and then you use it at every possible opportunity.

152
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,380
 I think it's just one of those things. Probably no one vetted it where it occurred to them that

153
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,820
 this might be a thing. I bet it didn't. I mean, it was really strange to me because so much

154
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,100
 Christmas music in America is deeply secular because of the whole church and state thing. So,

155
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,100
 and it seems enormously surprising to me that the community choir would have an entirely religious

156
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,460
 programme and yet not be a gospel choir because I think if they had booked a gospel choir, they

157
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:15,820
 probably would have expected that. But it wasn't. I circumvented all of these considerations by

158
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,540
 going to the panel item about role-playing games, which was happening at the same time as the opening

159
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,540
 ceremony was good. Yeah, I circumvent the whole thing by being in bed. So, yeah, so I did go to

160
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,620
 that panel on role-playing games. But then I, because the ceremony was still going on,

161
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,340
 you could time shift to the extent of running back a live broadcast to the beginning and then

162
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,420
 watching it, which is what I did. Oh, cunning. I've had a great conversation since the last

163
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:52,300
 talk to thought with Iro Alexandra, who is the person who is most pushing for best game hugo,

164
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,820
 which we talked about almost a year ago at this time in our Christmas episode in 2020.

165
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:04,380
 And in the process of that excellent conversation, I learnt how they pronounce the name, which is

166
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:11,020
 not how we pronounced it all that episode. So, I'm sorry. But I hope to be working with you in 2022

167
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:17,420
 as you get this to the Christmas meeting. We also heard from Duncan McGregor, who said that he

168
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,540
 understood Tenet. Crazy. You'll have to explain it to me at some point, Duncan. And we heard from

169
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,820
 Chris Garcia, who said that he drove from the desert to Los Angeles for some garlic paste.

170
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:36,220
 Fair enough. You do you, Chris. And then finally, Flick wrote in to ask us why we hadn't mentioned

171
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,940
 the Xinjiang region as part of our discussion of the Chinese Worldcon. For those who don't know,

172
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,980
 this is a region of China in which the Chinese government is perpetrating various acts against

173
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:54,860
 the native Eoyga Muslim population. And this has been described by some, including a House of

174
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,620
 Commons motion passed here in the UK as a genocide. The reason that we haven't discussed this is

175
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:08,700
 because none of us have the expertise or knowledge to discuss it sensitively and well. And so we

176
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,900
 agree that it is a horrible thing that is happening. And we are not sure this is the venue to discuss

177
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:19,660
 it. But we do want to say that we do thoroughly disagree with it. And I think also, and I don't

178
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,820
 think we made this clear last time that some people are not going to the Chinese Worldcon because

179
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,540
 of the actions of the Chinese government in Xinjiang. And absolutely, that's a valid choice for

180
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,380
 those people to make. And I mean, that is pretty much the reason why I voted against them. Basically,

181
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:40,220
 I very much like the bid team seemed great. I think it would be great to have Worldcons in

182
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,660
 more countries, but you know, taking it to China at this moment in time when there is a lot of

183
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,500
 repression and internment and other actions taken against minorities in China was not something I

184
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,100
 felt I could support. Yeah, but I think it's in turn, we want to kind of lay our position out.

185
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,020
 But it's not something we have any particular expertise in discussing.

186
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:09,020
 Yes. And just to echo Liz, I also voted for Winnipeg much to do with this issue and other issues

187
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,500
 related to China's human rights record. Yep, E3.

188
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:23,900
 So we're going to discuss the Hugo Awards a little bit. We did touch on this last episode,

189
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,500
 but since then there are more stats. And we love stats here on the old thought podcast.

190
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,420
 We have the long list, which is officially called the Hugo nomination report.

191
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,780
 And that tells us how many people nominated what in which categories, which is obviously

192
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:45,660
 very exciting and interesting stuff. But the most exciting thing on it was that Octa thought was

193
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:54,380
 the last fan cast to be knocked out of Best Fan cast. So we were seventh, we were very surprised,

194
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,540
 and we were very thrilled. And we thank you all very much. Those of you nominated us, that was

195
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:05,180
 lovely. However, we didn't actually get all that many nominations. And by number of nominations,

196
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:11,580
 we'd have been 12th. So Liz, would you like to explain how the nominations work? Because I

197
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,780
 spent a long time scratching my head over this. And I think some of our readers might also do.

198
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:23,260
 Yeah, so I had to go and reread the E pluribus Hugo method a couple of times before I got it.

199
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,020
 But basically, I think I do now have a handle on it. So basically, you have a point which is

200
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:35,500
 split across everything you nominate in a category. Every item you nominate gets a fraction of your

201
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,580
 points awarded to it. So when you start off, say you put five items in a category, they are all

202
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,980
 worth 0.2 of a point, so it adds up to one. And basically, what happens is they go down the list

203
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,980
 of nominees and they look at the two each round, which are bottom in terms of number of points.

204
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,740
 And they knock out the one which has the lowest number of actual people nominating it.

205
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,180
 So basically, every round is a contest between the ones which have the bottom two points. And

206
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,060
 when one of them gets knocked out, if you nominated that item, the redistribution of points across

207
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,220
 your other nominations means that they will now have a slightly higher points total and are more

208
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,700
 likely to carry through. So it's, I think it's quite an elegant method, actually, of saying,

209
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:20,140
 look, if you nominate stuff such that when we get to the last 10 or the last five, lots of other

210
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,580
 people have nominated the same as you, then they won't all make it onto the ballot. But this kind

211
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,460
 of extra check where you don't just remove the last one on point to remove the one of the last

212
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,460
 two on points with the fewest nominations means that basically if you and lots of other people

213
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,100
 all nominate a set of the same items, one of them will always get through because it will have a

214
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,420
 lot of people nominating it, even if it doesn't have a lot of points. Yeah, that's completely transparent

215
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,500
 and clear, isn't it? Absolutely.

216
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,900
 So this means that when we say we were the last one to be eliminated from the ballot, it does mean

217
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,340
 we did not, we were not the seventh most number of nominations, but because of this contest happening

218
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:03,980
 repeatedly through the nominations, we were the last one to be contested before the six finalists

219
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:10,140
 in that category were selected and what a slate of finalists they were. What this means in practice

220
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:16,220
 is that most people who nominated us did not nominate any other fan cast in the top 16.

221
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:25,740
 Which is, which looks to us like our listeners rose up on mass to support us and don't otherwise

222
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,900
 listen to that many other fan casts, but it could also look to somebody else like, oh god,

223
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,900
 they just rounded up their mates and got them to vote for them. Which Nittles White says is

224
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,740
 a known feature of EPH. Thank you, Nittles. So you guys should be listening to more good

225
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,740
 fan casts and to support that, we are going to in 2022 tell you about some other good fan casts

226
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,620
 that you might want to be listening to. And also you tell us if there's fan casts that we should be

227
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,020
 supporting that we are not already doing so. As we said last week, best fan cast is one of the

228
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,700
 categories where there is a risk of it not getting enough votes. So we very much want to make sure

229
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,340
 that everyone knows what fun casts are good and have a listen to them and voting them because

230
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,620
 we love this category. Yes, because we do a fan cast.

231
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:17,740
 We got a tweet of comment from Robot Archie on Twitter, who is Martin Easterbrook, who asked us

232
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:25,660
 what we thought of EPH continuing to be in effect after the problems posed by the puppies had gone

233
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:34,620
 away. And I have a couple of thoughts on this. So firstly, I think that part of the thing with

234
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,780
 EPH is the fact that it is in effect may be a contributing factor to the fact that attempts

235
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,740
 to game the Hugos have decreased markedly since that happened. So I'm a little bit reluctant to

236
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,500
 get rid of it, just in case it is having a deterrent effect on the people who were trying to game

237
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:59,420
 the Hugos. There was one category, which was best fan writer in which the sixth finalist to make

238
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,900
 onto the ballot got on because of EPH related effects, but then ended up winning the category.

239
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,420
 The other thing I think is that any mechanism which gets the eventual winner of a category

240
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,140
 onto that ballot is probably a good mechanism, because if the electorate think of those six people

241
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,260
 that person is the best, that to me indicates that person should have been on the ballot to be

242
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:28,620
 selected from. So I think in general, I am pro EPH remaining in effect, even after the slate

243
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:35,980
 voting has subsided. And I think it may also not be a coincidence that the Hugos have seen a very

244
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,380
 diverse range of voices being nominated since this came into effect as well. So I think in general,

245
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:48,220
 I see several potentially very good outcomes for the Hugos coming out of EPH. And then my co-hosts

246
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,780
 will tell me why I am wrong. I wasn't going to say you were wrong, actually. I was going to point

247
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:02,780
 out that the fan writing question is Elsa Schunerson. And actually, she had a book out in October 2021,

248
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:08,140
 which I saw being mentioned in quite a lot of places. So I wonder if actually she was nominated

249
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,620
 on the basis of previous work, but then when people went to find out more about it, they found her

250
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,020
 recent book, and that may be a contributing factor for why she came top in that category.

251
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,940
 Yeah, it's also one of those problems with fan writing, which is if you write a lot of

252
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:30,060
 blogs on a subject and you're very good at it, then turning those blogs into a book is a natural thing

253
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:38,380
 to do. And in this case, it was tweets rather than blog posts. But this is a work that is a

254
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,140
 professional work that has arisen out of what was fan writing. And this is something that does make

255
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,740
 the whole link between Fan and Pro, which we've talked about before, and we'll talk about again,

256
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,700
 very complicated. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't recognize fan writing, which Elsa's work clearly

257
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,980
 was. My worry about TPH, and I think on the whole what you said about it's fine, and it's not a bad

258
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:04,460
 mechanism, and I quite like it, I don't like mechanisms where if I am nominating, I have to think,

259
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:12,540
 oh, so I love this thing. And I have to consider whether I should nominate everything else, because

260
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:17,820
 if I nominate anything else, it reduces the chance the thing I love gets on the ballot.

261
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:25,340
 And that seems to me to be the big downside of EPH for me, is that it actively discourages,

262
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,940
 would discourage me because of being a kind of gaming mathematician from nominating more than one

263
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:37,820
 thing in some categories, on some occasions. I mean, I think that is only true if the thing you

264
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:45,340
 nominate at all extremely unpopular. That's right, because basically if you're nominating because

265
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,300
 you need, you're something needs your votes to get through to like the top 15 or something, then actually,

266
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,260
 and it would be diluted by nominating anything else, then if you know, everything your nomination

267
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,260
 is quite unpopular. Whereas if you nominate something which is nominated by lots of other people,

268
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,580
 and something which is nominated only by you, and your thing nominated only by you gets knocked out,

269
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:10,060
 it just kind of increases the points you get from your other nominations. I mean, my theory on EPH is

270
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,900
 one, yes, it's a deterrent. It basically means if you're a slate, you can get one thing on the ballot,

271
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,380
 and people are not keen enough on getting one thing on the ballot rather than six to pay for

272
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,860
 lots of supporting memberships to do that. But also it feels like it fits kind of with

273
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,660
 transferable vote, which because single transferable vote ends up kind of picking often not the thing

274
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,180
 that the most people put in first place necessarily, but the thing that maybe the most people were

275
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,140
 happy with having ranked highly, you know, it's not a first-pastor post-system. And now in the

276
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,820
 nominations, we've kind of caught with things which tries to pick like a set of nominees such that

277
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,540
 the largest number of people will see something they nominated on the ballot. So I think you could

278
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,100
 make an ideological argument for it there, but I think a much better argument is if we got rid of

279
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,100
 it, we might then have three years where someone was like, "Ah, I will now get a hundred of my

280
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,940
 friends to nominate six things, and it'll take us three years to put EPH back in to fix it again."

281
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,780
 So EPH actually made very few differences of ballots instead of just taking like the top six

282
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,580
 on nominations, but one place it did make a difference is in best editor's short form where Lee Harris

283
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,500
 was seventh, whereas he would have been sixth under like a pure nomination counting system.

284
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,020
 And this feels particularly harsh because he was also the last person eliminated in best

285
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,260
 editor long form. So he essentially was the last person limited in both best editor categories,

286
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,500
 which I feel is a little, it's just a little bit of a rough deal, especially as there's very few

287
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:39,100
 other changes that EPH made apart from I think one, one change in novella, that kind of thing.

288
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,620
 Lee were very sorry if you're listening, which you're not.

289
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:49,020
 The other interesting thing is the Mandalorian. So the Mandalorian had two episodes nominated

290
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:55,100
 and in the top six on best dramatic presentation short form, and because of that, they were removed

291
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,700
 from best dramatic presentation long form. And I assume that's because it managed to get two on

292
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,420
 the ballot in short form and one in long form, but actually it had the same number of votes for its

293
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,980
 highest ranked episode in short form and for long form. So I wonder how you actually decide

294
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,700
 which course you take there, because obviously it makes a difference to what gets on the ballot

295
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,300
 in fifth and sixth place in those categories. So if you are a Hugo administrator and you'd like to

296
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:28,620
 comment, do get in touch, Nicholas or Kat. But no, I mean, you're not, you know, just because it

297
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,540
 is interesting, it is very interesting. I'm also going to link to a bunch of blog posts from

298
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,860
 Camistross for that done, where he has dug into the Hugo nominations in even more detail. So if

299
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,300
 anyone really likes that, there's some more stats. And we are also going to link to Nicholas White's

300
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:53,980
 analysis of the Hugo Awards. We dug down the long list because I love digging down the long

301
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,940
 list and I found a lot of interesting things in it. There are always interesting things. And the

302
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,060
 first one I want to talk to about, no, somebody else can talk about Best Series. Best Series is

303
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,340
 my favorite Hugo Award category, because it is the category that consistently throws up things that

304
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:15,900
 I like in the genre, because most of my genre reading is big old series of great books. Ben

305
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,020
 Aranovich's Rivers of London series is amazing. I just read the short story anthology in that

306
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,740
 universe that has come out and I really enjoyed it. And I've loved all the books. I've recently

307
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:31,420
 started reading the comics as well, but I would love to see that series win the Best Series Hugo

308
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:38,220
 down the road. And yes, hopefully, hopefully we will nominate that again in future years. Someone

309
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,620
 else can talk about young wizards. Right. Okay. So Diana Dwayne's Young Wizards, So You Want to

310
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:49,580
 Be a Wizard, Fantastic Books. Strongly recommended. They're amazing. In general, I am, as regular

311
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,620
 listeners will know, not a fan of things that are about the process of the conventional Hugo

312
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:01,100
 Awards getting nominated in their own right, because I feel like it's a bit circular and not

313
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,820
 necessarily what we really should be celebrating. We should be looking more outwards from our own

314
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,620
 mechanisms. However, tucked away in the long list were some nominations for something called

315
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,060
 the Hugo Spreadsheet of Doom, which I was not previously familiar with. So I went and looked it up.

316
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:22,700
 And it is a spreadsheet of possible things for the Hugo Awards. And I am quite a big fan of crown

317
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,460
 sourcing lists of things that might be eligible for awards. And I think these sorts of lists are

318
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,980
 great if lots of different people contribute to them so that you have a really broad

319
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:39,820
 set of things that people could be reading and looking at. So we are going to put a link to the

320
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,940
 Hugo Spreadsheet of Doom in the show notes. We'll put the link to the 2022 one so you can start

321
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,420
 nominating. And we think it's open for your suggestions. And because I particularly think that the fan

322
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,580
 Hugo is currently being a bit poorly served by the nominators and voters, I particularly suggest

323
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,340
 that you get all your suggestions for fan works, fan artists and fan writers and fanzines and

324
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:09,580
 fan casts onto there. And for those who don't know, the Hugo Spreadsheet of Doom is hosted and

325
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:15,740
 maintained by the fine folk over at Lady Business. I'm just going to point out that I didn't realise

326
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,540
 you hadn't seen the Hugo Spreadsheet of Doom before. And I've definitely put it in the show notes

327
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:30,700
 at least once. Brilliant. Did you know about it, John? Yeah. It's only me. So lots of the things. So

328
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:37,900
 for example, also on the long list with the fact that Outworlds, which was a bit of a poster

329
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,980
 child fan, fanzine fan on this year was kind of people really, really wanted to get outwards

330
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,820
 onto the ballot and they did not manage to do that. But it was quite close. This was the last

331
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,940
 issue of Outworlds. So you're not going to be able to do another one. The giant Outworlds

332
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:00,540
 71. Just say that and then Mark can write in and tell us we're on. Right? Good lock hook.

333
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:12,700
 Outwards 69. Nice. Which is definitely correct. Uh... Outworlds 71, I say slightly, not quite sure.

334
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,260
 Lee, please write in Mark Plummer. So it's its last episode of Outworlds. So that was its last

335
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,300
 chance. It didn't quite make it off the ballot, but it did do very creditably.

336
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:26,540
 William Brydings, portable storage, which is my number one thing for if you like interesting

337
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,700
 fanzines that do a lot of different things, you should definitely be checking out portable

338
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:38,140
 storage because it is full of... Ah! Circon articles, fanish articles, articles that are like way off

339
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,780
 everywhere. It's just the most extraordinary thing and it's on efansies so you can read it for free.

340
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,100
 And also the drink tank was something that looked like it. To me, looks fanzine shaped that was

341
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,860
 just a little bit below the ballot by a... by friend of the show, Chris Garcia. But I don't think any of

342
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,580
 those fanzines were on... were on the Hugo spreadsheet of doom and in my view they should have been.

343
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,660
 And if I had known about the Hugo spreadsheet of doom at nomination time, they'd all have been on.

344
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:16,700
 Raytheon sponsored the Hugo Awards in some capacity and later Discon 3 released an apology

345
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:23,580
 for this and I believe donated the amount that Raytheon sponsored to various charities dedicated

346
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:29,100
 to peaceful works. We will put a link to Discon 3's apology in the show notes. Lots of people were

347
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:35,340
 very sad about this because Raytheon has done some things to do with the US military industrial

348
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,220
 complex and understandably if you have problems with the US foreign policy vis-a-vis the US military,

349
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,460
 you may therefore have problems with Raytheon and their capitalist influence.

350
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,700
 Well, I mean they make bombs. Raytheon make bombs. They make bombs work. And that is a thing that

351
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,940
 upsets a lot of people, anti-topsets a lot of people on Twitter and I think more generally people

352
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:00,780
 going that this is slightly off as a sponsor for the Hugo's. The other sponsorship for Discon was

353
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,820
 Google which nobody people sometimes have a problem with Google sponsoring things but nobody really

354
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:12,220
 has a problem in this case because what Google sponsored was the human transcription of almost

355
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:18,380
 every programme item and that was popular with everybody was not obviously selling Google though

356
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,180
 obviously it's quite related to the sort of thing that Google cares about and likes and will mean

357
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:28,540
 that those transcripts are probably indexed forever in Google's set of indexing the world's knowledge

358
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:37,500
 but it kind of feels very much aligned with what the Worldcon is about and I think the Worldcon didn't

359
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:44,060
 do a good enough job of demonstrating how Raytheon sponsorship might also have been aligned with

360
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,580
 the sorts of things we do at Worldcons and people were extremely upset about it. What they did was

361
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,220
 sponsor the red carpet. We don't know the exact amounts of money but what it meant was that the

362
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,420
 Hugo, that the backdrop for photographs of the Hugo Awards was a backdrop that had

363
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:08,780
 the Hugo Awards and Raytheon as the co-branding on the backdrop and I feel like this is something

364
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,300
 that I would like the Mark Protection Committee to have a think about and might say to future

365
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,380
 Worldcons you are not allowed to have anything on the backdrop for the Hugo Awards banner apart

366
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,420
 from the Hugo Awards and maybe the name of the convention. Of course the Mark Protection Committee

367
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,580
 can't do that because they're outranked by the Worldcon Committee so if the Worldcon Committee...

368
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,860
 It's the use of the Hugo Awards brand? The Worldcon Committee has the

369
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,460
 final say in how that's used so if the Worldcon Committee and the NBC disagree on

370
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,580
 Hugo or branding the Worldcon Committee wins because the entire point it was for

371
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,060
 us is to vest the power in the Worldcon. Ah this is with my tedious NBC hat on.

372
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:47,580
 No this is great so does that mean that the Mark Protection Committee could issue a non-binding

373
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:53,900
 resolution? Suggesting that this would be a good idea. Basically the whole of us for

374
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:59,100
 his design so that was first doesn't have much actual power over the Worldcon which is on purpose

375
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,820
 but it does mean that Worldcons can dig themselves giant holes and that it's very difficult for

376
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,100
 us first to legislate in a way that prevents that in any meaningful sense. Which is probably the

377
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,220
 right way for it to be. Yeah which is probably what we want but does result in the occasional

378
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,420
 big whoops. Okay so this was a bit of a big whoops. I think I want to go back in time a little bit

379
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:25,580
 on Raytheon and Discon which is that a couple of months before the Worldcon it didn't have any

380
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:33,340
 money and they were definitely scrubbing about quite vigorously to to try and find some sources of

381
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,580
 money because they were worried that they were going to lose a packet and this is of course before

382
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:43,900
 they got 2000 unexpected supporting memberships from China which almost certainly sorted their

383
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:50,380
 financial problems out much more than and so therefore they were then in a position to give the money

384
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,860
 to a suitable cause but certainly there was a point where everyone was like this Worldcon has

385
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,660
 no money we are really really tight it's going to be very very difficult and I think it's in that

386
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,300
 context that they took the money. One of the things that was pointed out on Twitter after the

387
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:10,620
 controversy over the Raytheon sponsorship was that Raytheon were also one of the contractors

388
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:16,620
 employed in launching the James Webb Space Telescope and so Sean Duke tweeted saying that he was

389
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,940
 eating popcorn watching everyone who was offended by Raytheon being involved with the Hugo Awards

390
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,660
 also being involved with a thing that everyone was celebrating. Yeah I mean I think it just shows

391
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:31,980
 that this is you know the issue of who should sponsor Worldcon and in particular the Hugo Awards

392
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:38,300
 is probably not a particularly clear cut thing I mean I think it's worth noting that like Raytheon

393
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:43,820
 is actually like four subsidiaries and you know one of them is the Missile and Defense One and

394
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:49,180
 it was the intelligence and space part that was sponsoring the Hugos but you know can you really

395
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:54,220
 separate what a company does out into these different parts so easily and also does it mean

396
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,580
 that they essentially can say well actually know this isn't a bit that makes missiles

397
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,100
 that's sponsoring you this is the bit that just makes the radar that guides missiles or something

398
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:06,060
 like that so I think it's just it's it's it's complicated to do this sort of thing under capitalism

399
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,340
 because I bet there's like three companies capable of making the guidance system for the James Webb

400
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:17,660
 Space Telescope and they probably almost all have some hand in you know defense defense related

401
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,180
 companies and technologies as well and you kind of have to accept that if you want to have space

402
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:28,540
 telescopes so maybe the thing is we should all we should be interrogating maybe who sponsors the

403
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:34,780
 Hugos and who we kind of have putting their names on the backdrop of our biggest awards and you know

404
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,980
 I think future conventions are going to have to come up with a policy for this because it was

405
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,620
 definitely being asked of the next conventions but maybe it is something where we should also say

406
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,420
 actually is it great that we can only do space exploration essentially with the help of these

407
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,460
 companies that are also heavily involved in kind of the defense industry which may be getting a

408
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,340
 little wider than you know the issue of World Cons sponsorship and this is one of the problems

409
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:02,380
 with scientific endeavor is that it's very difficult to do scientific endeavor without engaging with

410
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:09,820
 capitalism and obviously especially in space physics you do end up relying on companies that

411
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:15,580
 also do missiles I mean the entire field of endeavor is based on the v2 rocket which was not

412
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:21,420
 an ethically great development but you know then we walked on the moon does it is very complicated

413
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,500
 very complicated for all mankind season one does quite a good job of unpicking some of these

414
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,340
 things in an interesting way oh well don't forget to just back on top picture but I will also say

415
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,140
 that google is also a defense contractor and no one has mentioned google in that light I think

416
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,380
 it's probably because obviously that makes up a much smaller part of google's profits than rathion

417
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,500
 so I completely understand why but it is interesting that it is clearly about you know there is an

418
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,340
 acceptable percentage of defense contracting that will not stir controversy it's really difficult

419
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,540
 it's a really hard thing so if you're a defense contractor and you'd like to sponsor octa thought

420
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,580
 please get in touch

421
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:11,820
 file 770 reported that in the aftermath of Chengdu in 2023 becoming the seated world con

422
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:17,100
 winnie bag are exploring a bid for the 2023 nazvik which is the north american science

423
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:22,700
 fiction convention which will be held in excuse me which is held in north america in years where

424
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,580
 the world con is not in north america and this makes a lot of sense because they can repurpose

425
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:35,260
 normal under the work they've done in that regard chris gossia friend of the podcast has told me

426
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,420
 that he's planning to run nazvik as a relaxicon i think it is front room something like that

427
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,700
 so that might be a third bid chris if you're out there tell us about your 2023 nazvik bid but

428
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:51,180
 definitely a relaxicon nazvik which i believe means the and that's relaxed con of the american

429
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:55,660
 sense of a convention without any program rather than the british sense of a convention that has

430
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,980
 entirely too much program and i mean with with the world con being in Chengdu i'm sure the nazvik in

431
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:07,180
 2023 will be extremely small and will fit easily into chris's front room the orlando in 2026 world

432
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:15,340
 combat is also pivoting to bidding for a 2023 nazvik and this supersedes their 2026 world

433
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:23,340
 combat which means the bidding conventions for 2026 are now jeddah in saudi arabia los angeles

434
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:30,780
 in california usa and nise in france which is where briece is from so everyone should vote for nise

435
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:38,460
 very excited gonna go and briece cosplay if it wins uh so you know briece briece dinese one of the

436
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,460
 best french films oh so good briece dinese please put a link to that in the show notes i will yeah

437
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:51,180
 cuz i'm not spaffled it's it's like uh yeah it's very good and if winnipeg wins the 2023 nazvik it

438
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:57,500
 will be the first ever nazvik to be held outside the united states that's diversity pals i mean it's

439
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:04,540
 also worth noting that at the moment there are two 2023 bids but also if glausco in 2024 win the

440
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,340
 2024 worldcon which looks quite likely as they're currently unopposed and there'll also be 2024

441
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,300
 nazvik so maybe one of them will decide to to swap but obviously the 2024 nazvik will be much

442
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:21,020
 smaller and that segues nicely into glausco's new push for the new year and they have launched um

443
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:30,860
 glausco fan artist hugo finalist Ian Clarke has done a lovely poster for glausco um showing with

444
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:38,860
 scenes of glausco and the slogan i can move 500 miles for glausco in 2024 which is clearly a

445
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:44,060
 reference to the proclamers song 500 miles which we're going to put a link to in the show notes in

446
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:50,060
 case you haven't heard it um because octa thought the podcast of sartz fiction sartz fiction fandom

447
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:56,940
 and massive earworms the idea is that you do exercise over and above your normal amount of

448
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,140
 exercise for over and about your normal walking around the house actually get up and put your

449
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,660
 shoes on or roll your wheels or swim or climb or whatever you want to do for 500 miles before

450
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:15,980
 glausco wins the bid or glausco gets to shycon 8 to try with the bid sorry if 500 miles is not

451
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:20,780
 enough for you and you think that's not a long way to go in in a couple hundred days then why don't

452
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:27,580
 you walk 500 more run or swim or roll or whatever it is that you'd like to do to move and i will as a

453
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:37,900
 committed member of the youth be instead moving 804.672 kilometers outbla i will say although i think

454
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,460
 this is a lovely concept and i think it's to be applauded and i completely understand why they've

455
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,420
 done move 500 miles instead of walk 500 miles because i have been thinking about moving house i was

456
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:54,380
 like i mean i am gonna move to new castle from south amptom but that is an unrealistic expectation

457
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:59,820
 of everyone in british fandom to do so i am glad that it is exercise.

458
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,100
 Hoorah for glausco encouraging us all getting out and moving a little bit more

459
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:08,140
 i think that is a fantastic thing to be doing and i am absolutely committed to this and if i

460
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:15,900
 stuff it up then um yeah wait till i get my picks for why i might stuff it up so let's do picks

461
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,900
 picks per bit pick picks so i've been quite busy this two weeks but i've discovered a great new

462
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,900
 science fiction show on television everyone should be watching and i have watched um season one episode

463
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,540
 one of the expanse which is on amazon prime and it's very good and i think you should all be

464
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:38,220
 watching it i know that some of you have been going on a meet-and-watch for approximately 47 and a

465
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,860
 half episodes of this podcast but there we go i've caught up now except for the other 68 episodes

466
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,260
 and in 2022 i'm going to be doing a lot more of a lot sort of things including watching the whole

467
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,900
 of the expanse and um reading more books and reading more fanzines and doing more fanak and

468
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,980
 doing more art and um doing some more work because i have to make some money and um i haven't really

469
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,460
 decided what i'm going to do less of but i'm thinking about giving up sleep very sensible

470
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:09,260
 okay that'll work guys i look forward to chronicling your attempts to do this in or in an audio

471
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:15,580
 medium every fortnight for the next year i like the expanse i'm glad that allison is watching it

472
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:21,820
 first episode was great it's still going to be as great as that it has its ups and downs i wouldn't

473
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:27,100
 say it was always amazingly good but it is as a whole very satisfying and i am enjoying it and if

474
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,140
 you're very quick you could catch up before they finish you got like two weeks

475
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:40,220
 that is optimism that that wow i look forward to you picking the expanse as your pick for the next

476
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:50,300
 68 episodes then i promise not to do this i'm going to read some real science fiction in the

477
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:57,500
 next two weeks or so i have actually um coincidentally just uh just placed a hold on the ninth book in

478
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,300
 the series at the library so i will be reading that hopefully in the relatively near future

479
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:08,300
 i think it'll be about six or seven weeks probably um but yes do you know do you know what i did on

480
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:17,420
 my holiday allison i read some science fiction and fantasy oh excellent so my pick is vita noster

481
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,980
 a book originally published in russian by ukraine writers marina and segue die cenco and i obviously

482
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:30,460
 read the english translation which translated by julia miteff hercy you can reduce it to say that

483
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:36,460
 it is essentially a russian magical college novel kind of you know in the vein of harry potter

484
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:42,620
 the magicians etc but it's actually much more interesting and weirder than that it essentially

485
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:50,620
 follows um sasha a teenage girl in russia who is approached by by a wizard basically and and carries

486
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:57,580
 out a bunch of kind of pretty onerous and strenuous tasks for him um and then these are basically

487
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,620
 our entry into a magical college and she goes to the magical college where it turns out that magic is

488
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:09,420
 just kind of much stranger and weirder than i've i've seen in most novels and it's all about how

489
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,140
 essentially learning the process of magic learning to like they end up reading what starts off as

490
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:19,260
 gibberish but becomes something which is intelligible to them it's basically the magic system is about

491
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:25,740
 kind of retraining your mind to kind of reshape the world in a different way and yeah it just it

492
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,940
 just feels very different to kind of other magical college type novels i've read sasha obviously

493
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:39,100
 has great power but um it's not always able to control that great power and the end i think is

494
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,980
 basically an allegory for sort of the creation of the world and there is a figure who may or may not

495
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:49,660
 be kind of the devil involved and it just kind of you know it feels diffused with this sort of

496
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,420
 particularly russian russian background it was all about kind of living in these dormitories

497
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:01,100
 through the freezing cold and and sneaking in vodka and i really i really enjoyed it it's very strange

498
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:08,780
 it ends in quite a strange way but um it's definitely worth reading nice i may look that up

499
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,620
 when is it eligible for the hugos Liz or is it before that no i think came out in 2018

500
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:25,020
 oh for an old hat yeah i am going to also pick a very recent and up and coming tv series

501
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,140
 that i'm sure no one has heard of and everyone will rush out and watch

502
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:34,300
 hispania and i just watched the last episode of Buffy the vampire slayer which i'm told all the

503
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:39,180
 cool kids have already watched ages ago but i didn't watch when i was a kid so i've been catching up

504
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:43,980
 i really enjoyed it season six was not as good as the other seasons season four is clearly the

505
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:49,660
 best season don't at me no it was i did like season seven quite a lot but yeah i really enjoyed

506
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:55,100
 it on the whole we've also about halfway through season three of angel and i'm very much enjoying

507
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:01,580
 that as well so yeah i i have been hugely enjoying that kind of trip down memory lane and then the

508
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:07,180
 next job after that will be babylon five with adverts because it's on i am db tv and that has

509
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:14,140
 adverts so that's fun it's not fun but you know it just downloaded from the internet no never

510
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,020
 it's on amazon prime isn't it it's on i am db tv which you access through amazon prime but

511
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,100
 you can also get if you don't subscribe to amazon prime but it means that it has adverts because

512
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:29,660
 that's how they pay for it i see yes because i am db is owned by amazon and has its own tv

513
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:37,660
 service yeah anyway streaming yeah it's all very easy to understand what's going on

514
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,940
 the other hilariously retro pick i have is co-co which is less hilariously retro but we

515
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,980
 rewatched it on christmas day because i felt like i hadn't leaked enough tears that day

516
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:53,740
 and i needed to do some more and yup still blub the whole way through the ending oh my goodness but

517
00:43:53,740 --> 00:44:00,460
 i do love that movie haven't seen it should i watch it oh it's so good i love it i don't know why i

518
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:06,300
 haven't seen it i liked it i need to get marion round and say we're gonna watch co-co today i also

519
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:12,700
 watched it and i also cried a little bit i mean i also cried it up and toy story three so it was

520
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:19,020
 obviously pixar i saw up in the cinema and i went to do what i was absolutely wrecked 10 minutes

521
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,660
 into the movie so yeah we watched co-co the thing is when you watch co-co or any of these other films

522
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,140
 we've mentioned in a cinema it's dark so no one can see you ugly crying but when you watch it on

523
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:33,180
 christmas day with the lights on everyone can see you ugly crying and you can see everyone else

524
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:41,900
 crazy yeah you know what's worse i watched it on a plane oh oh yep no for enough

525
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:48,700
 uh yep yep yep yep okay right in with your favorite crying at movies and it goes

526
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:56,780
 listeners uh because i suspect there are some doozies in our audience but for now that was the

527
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:15,260
 octa-thaw podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me
