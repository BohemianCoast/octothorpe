00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:22,720
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 18th episode of the Oct Thor podcast, a podcast

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,240
 for science fiction and science fiction fandom. I am Jon Coxon.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,680
 I am Alison Scott.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,440
 No, I'm Liz Batty.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,760
 Today's going to be a somewhat shorter episode than usual because we are running a convention

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,400
 and it turns out that that involves work, which I didn't know and Alison and Liz didn't

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,640
 tell me. Boo.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,640
 We so did. I said it wouldn't be too much work and that was wrong.

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
 Yeah, exactly.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,200
 I think the amount of work it is reflects the fact that none of us have run a convention

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,520
 quite like this before because this amount of convention would not be very much work

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,400
 if it was a real but it's more work because it's a because we're all doing it for the

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
 first time. So none of us have any of the, I guess, muscle memory.

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,160
 We're not doing anything on autopilot except when we do.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,160
 Yes. So before we get into letters of comment, I just want to say if you are listening to

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:25,120
 this and if you like online conventions, join Punctuation at PunctuationCon.uk.

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,960
 You are listening to this and you don't particularly care for online conventions but you want to

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,440
 give us a favour anyway. Join Punctuation at PunctuationCon.uk and if you just fancy a natter,

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,480
 then join because they'll be nattering.

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,440
 Hooray.

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,520
 This is a great way to support the podcast but well it isn't because we don't get any of the money

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,560
 because it's all going to fan funds and charity but it's a great way to show your appreciation

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
 of the podcast because as you can see we have no advertising sponsorship.

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,080
 If you are an advertiser and you'd like to sponsor OctaThork,

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,520
 absolutely get in touch, we have 67 regular listeners and we do in fact have at least one

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,160
 convention member who's joined the convention because they like the podcast. So I think that's

28
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,640
 quite good really.

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,600
 I need to caveat that 67 which is, I don't know, is that, did you make that up Alison?

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,000
 Yeah 90% of statistics are made up of on the spot and that's one of them.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,560
 Excellent. Okay, what we do have is, and I believe I'm now using this correctly,

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,800
 a plethora of letters of comment.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
 What we have more than we want?

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,160
 Well yeah because ideally we'd have none and we could just sack this in super quickly and go

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
 back to con running right? So...

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,040
 No, no, no. The letters are what's providing content for your podcast this morning because

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,000
 otherwise it would get to Thursday and people would be like, "Oh my god there's another day to go

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,760
 before punctuation. What am I going to do for entertainment?"

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,960
 And they would look at OctaThork and we'd be like with three minutes long.

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:03,200
 Yes, by the time you listen to this list there will be one day until punctuation.

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,360
 About a day and a half Liz is making a face into the camera which I think is dread.

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,200
 I wasn't making a face but yeah I do have a knowing sense of dread.

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,040
 I would say also if this episode is too short for your simple needs,

44
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,920
 if you are a member of punctuation come on the Discord where there's been quite a lot of chat

45
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,160
 going on and you can A) work out your happy with Discord and B)

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,760
 see what everybody's saying and maybe make some friends

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,320
 if you don't know anyone. Yeah and come and say hello, we like that.

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,720
 I've just waved, this is a podcast. I need to wave less on podcasts.

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,000
 That's like 2021 goal. Fair enough. And we will say so we are planning to run,

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,480
 the convention is mostly on Discord and so if you are not familiar with Discord please do join.

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,760
 As soon as you hear this, come and join. Then if you have any trouble we can help you through

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,280
 email or through Facebook Messenger or through other mechanisms and we will be very helpful.

53
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,640
 So yes.

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,200
 Onto letters of comment. Liz, do you want to read Jo's tweet of comment?

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,320
 Jo's tweet of comment about things she's missing from social spaces is the ability to hear and

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,000
 understand multi-threaded conversations and the problem is that Zoom conversations all come from

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,120
 one direction it's hard to disentangle multiple speakers and I can see what she means and that

58
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,760
 you don't get those occasionally branching and coming back together conversations in a group

59
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,760
 that you can have say if you're all sitting around a table and you know what's going on in

60
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,520
 Zoom you just get a bunch of people talking over each other. It's rubbish.

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,440
 Yeah and that's one of the reasons you can't have Zoom breakout rooms above about eight people

62
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,960
 before it gets a little bit chaotic. We'll definitely be trying out some other things. I mean we may do

63
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,760
 wonder which is the internet service that used to be called Yodrive and we may be doing a bit of

64
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,800
 Gather Town. I mean I think this is still an unsolved problem there.

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,600
 Yes it is. I think and this is one of the reasons why I think although I do understand

66
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,240
 that obviously Discord is not good for audio video in the same way that Zoom is but I do think

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,360
 Discord text chats do represent the closest to this that I have seen as an accessible platform.

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
 Because I find you can have the different channels so you can have different places to

69
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,120
 wander into but like in those channels you can have conversations that are like bifurcating and

70
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,320
 coming back together and that is the closest I've seen. But I think it's an enormously difficult

71
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,720
 thing to solve in audio video and perhaps easier to solve in text. Bob is he text isn't quite as good.

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:59,440
 So yeah it's tricky. We're also going to the other way that you can't solve it is in online spaces

73
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,360
 and we are definitely in kind of virtual reality like headset spaces and we're going to have a

74
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,560
 go at one of those as well but there's a big problem that so it gives you some of the spatial

75
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880
 stuff and it allows you to move around to different people and it gives you sort of

76
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,600
 nearer you are the better the sound is further you are the sound is further away and it gives you

77
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,080
 the sense of presence and the only downside is you look like a robot and have to wear a

78
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:32,400
 helmet on your head neither of which are perfect for social interactions. Oh yes true okay um we

79
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,360
 also had a I'm going to describe it as a flurry of tweets from listener and and is a new listener

80
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,200
 who has listened to our entire back catalog since the last episode of octa-thorpe so welcome

81
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:52,640
 and we will henceforth call anyone who on board by listening to our entire back catalog as and

82
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,600
 that will be their nickname it will get enormously confusing and it will be good but she did send us

83
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,720
 well she sent us some thoughts she sent us a tweet of comment with a photograph of her

84
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,960
 breakfast at the virtual octa-con which will perhaps be the chapter art at the point you listen to this

85
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:20,080
 and we we note the mushrooms she also sent us a tweet saying that she is dependent on the kindness

86
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,720
 and others for good poached eggs which um okay so so Gordon Ramsey who's famous for saying the

87
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,800
 sort of things you can't say on a podcast I understand you can but we have to put a little

88
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,560
 label on the podcast now um does actually have a video on his on youtube about how to poach an

89
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,360
 egg and it's very good excellent you can learn to poach eggs it's fine just get fresh eggs it's

90
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,160
 very good if you if you know somebody who has chickens the best way to make poached eggs is to

91
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,280
 get an egg more or less straight from the chicken and make that your poached egg because because eggs

92
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,120
 poached much better when they're very fresh um this might be too much egg poaching information for

93
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,480
 a slow podcast but you know oh I don't know I think it's excellent no I agree I have tried to

94
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,000
 learn to poach eggs in various different ways you know whisking it little like egg poachers that

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,920
 sit on the side of the pan and they were all terrible okay fresh eggs yeah but then I'd have to go out

96
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,920
 and get eggs before a breakfast and that's just not going to work is it and they don't need to be

97
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,160
 that fresh a couple of days it's fine but generally speaking when you get an egg in the supermarket

98
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,280
 it may have been it may have spent some time getting from the the chicken or the duck to you so

99
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,560
 so it's easier if you get them from someone to keep the chickens or a farm where they they're just kind

100
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,160
 of getting the eggs and selling those straight off um we also have we also have a letter of

101
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:55,760
 comment from Andrge who um yes caught up uh caught up with us and um has tested us a a a long

102
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,840
 letter of comment basically commenting on every theme that we've had in the past 17 episodes

103
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:11,120
 which is great um but she does um she does write a poem um and it is it is quite good so I shall

104
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:19,680
 I shall read it now Oh to thought poetry corner Oh bugger I forgot I was told to write a rhyme

105
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,240
 this is the best I've got in the available time cracking poem there's an egg there's an egg

106
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:36,480
 reference for you yes so another tweet of comment we got is from Duncan McGregor who says that he

107
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,280
 thinks it would be off brand if we run an online convention and we don't make a complete hash of

108
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,600
 it which is funny because an octa thought is sometimes called a hash yeah no no I think we've

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:59,520
 got good news for Duncan he then follows that up with has he asks whether we have pounded this

110
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,800
 joke into the ground yet which is funny because an octa thought is sometimes called a pound it's

111
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,280
 quite good I thoroughly enjoyed this tweet you can't see but I'm nodding vigorously and I know I'm

112
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,560
 fairly sure that we've not yet pounded that joke into oblivion and that our readers will help I

113
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,920
 think Duncan's the only one that's come up with it so hats off to Duncan he wins my respect he

114
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:29,760
 already had it but uh okay we also had other letters we also got a letter of comment from Max

115
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:38,800
 which was titled a thought vigorous um and she got the title from gmail's ai

116
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,920
 generating email subjects so but it's a good email subject um for a letter of comment

117
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,440
 particularly um but she says that she has managed to incapacitate herself with muscle fatigue

118
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,080
 caused by playing vigorous VR after a month's break if you too would like to ae horribly when

119
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,920
 you try to move your arms laugh or breathe too heavily try the thrill of the fight on oculus quest

120
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:13,120
 so I have done so yes I bought it yesterday I beat the training dummy and I beat like the the

121
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,200
 practice game and then they put me in against the first opponent and I had three two-minute rounds

122
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,880
 I'd stopped this by because my my thing that tells you how much exercise you do if you play a video

123
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,800
 game said you'll be you'll be burning about 15 calories a minute playing this and I was like

124
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,840
 god I'll die that's impossible and I can confirm that that yes three three rounds of two minutes did

125
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,520
 kill me and also I lost so but I feel like hey today so I'm planning to do it again today so we will

126
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,560
 we will see how it goes I kind of I should say I don't really approve of the theme of this video

127
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:56,800
 game which is about beating up men a lot boxing actually ravio too yeah as good as I um so yes

128
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,840
 so for those who are the way i thrill of the fight is a VR boxing game and now I have learned that this

129
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,640
 exists and now I have learned that a listener and ours and both have it I assume we are going to have

130
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,120
 a VR boxing match at punctuation it doesn't have multiplayer that's all these people going

131
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:21,680
 multiplayer would be good oh what that is why ah but also it's obvious I would get beaten up by

132
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,600
 max a lot yes but that would be that would be a I would I would come to that program item

133
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,880
 so you know when it gets multiplayer if it's a lot of players by punctuation to

134
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,200
 and if we do punctuation to then we'll talk I mean I feel because I was like I'm I'm a woman and I

135
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,280
 would I would probably enjoy this game more if my opponents were also female and it about 30 seconds

136
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,440
 less than 30 seconds about three seconds of thought caused me to work out but in fact I would

137
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:04,080
 probably prefer this game if my opponents were cute aliens I don't really the whole beating up

138
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:13,440
 people is is not quite for me um yeah I I I have low tolerance for video games in which

139
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,040
 of the I I can I can have any sort of empathy for the other side um on the other hand you know

140
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,720
 boxing games are quite fun and they are fantastically good just um in terms of exercise that you

141
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,240
 could do in your house without equipment hashtag other than the asterisk other than the extremely

142
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,120
 expensive oculus quest that they're pretty good cheap too is it it I mean obviously

143
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,440
 oculus quest is expensive but but the game is eight pounds which seems to me to be very reasonable

144
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,800
 and a lot better than a lot of oculus game quest games which seem to be quite expensive fair enough

145
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,320
 um Liz if you bought a VR boxing game what would you want your opponents to look like

146
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,120
 thing is I don't actually want to play a VR boxing game all I want to be a headset for is so I can

147
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,720
 play beats over that's true that's a good point Liz playing beats over is a sight to behold and if

148
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
 there was any good way of doing that as a program writer we would also do that but there is not

149
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,160
 one day listeners one day yeah I feel that this is all this all of this stuff's gonna come

150
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,240
 quite soon they're kind of getting quite good at the the necessary tech so that you can film

151
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,000
 people while they're also playing on their oculus quest and you can see both things at once um yeah I

152
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,080
 um I feel I might actually enjoy this game more if if I was beating on Donald Trump because I'm

153
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,720
 not done with that yet oh yeah it's gonna take you a little while and I can also think of some

154
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,440
 also current politicians that I could that I wouldn't mind having as my virtual uh right okay

155
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,040
 onto Claire Breiley of Croydon who is sent has a lock um she says that no one should actually

156
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,480
 nominate weekend we mix for a hugo and we categorically disagree we are all going to nominate for a

157
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,560
 hugo we thoroughly encourage all of our listeners to nominate for a hugo um so that's that good

158
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,680
 that we sorted that out mark devised and constructed the lego box for sending the

159
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,440
 weeabics through the post and she also sends us a poem now I'm hoping Alison can explain this

160
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,640
 hang on a second oh Claire sent us a poem yes um Claire sent us a poem which I will read out

161
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:29,600
 and I I confidently predict that four or five of our readers will fall over laughing at this one

162
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,400
 and actually knows because it's actually gay four or five of our readers will find this funny

163
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,640
 and the rest will go no no I don't get that um I found it funny but I don't understand the

164
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:47,280
 contexts so I thought I thought having you but she's provided she has provided context yes

165
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,280
 um so which we will put into the show notes for you online strain can mean physical pain

166
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:01,280
 so you stretch but say ow is that blood you won't hurt your necks if you just enter text in

167
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:11,040
 widow is wonderful mud thank you and and the background for this um is that widow is wonderful

168
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:20,240
 things well widow is things a variety of um sorts have been a fanist trope for many many decades um

169
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,800
 I also like the the kind of echoes here of um a flanders and swam because they are also into mud

170
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,160
 they're not the same sort of mud wonderful mud though or glorious mud which is very similar and

171
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,160
 so Claire also says so Claire says if causing a global volcanic eruption is a sufficient code of

172
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,040
 condor violation to justify ejection from the convention um she worries about some of the

173
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,080
 behaviors that might be acceptable by comparison I would like to say that when we when we said that

174
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,760
 global volcanic eruptions were a kind of color violation we don't mean to exclude any of the

175
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,760
 varied um examples Claire gives one example of a thing that would not be acceptable is setting fire

176
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,400
 to a lake I don't know how many people learn to sun that joke but it is a joke and if you understood

177
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,120
 it you get points yeah if you understood that joke get in touch and you can have a point for your

178
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,720
 house at punctuation yes I know Claire will get it anyone else I'm unsure um and she concludes by

179
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,800
 saying that she only drinks two or three points a coffee now or when she was civil servant it was

180
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,840
 four or five points with occasional espresso's which I took two mugs which is I believe like

181
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:33,680
 maybe one point one and a half point so Claire is more caffeine than woman during my if you read

182
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,200
 my trip report cover to cover you will understand the reference there's no charts I'm going to

183
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,720
 read you I mean I think I'm pretty sure I've done my ego scan there that's why that's why anyone

184
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,520
 who understands the joke yeah that that's why anyone who understands the joke gets a point because

185
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,160
 I am not confident it's like PhD theses they do not get read widely is that like how you know when

186
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,280
 sometimes like professors will put like a hidden word on their web page that you have to quote back

187
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,200
 to them when you email them to prove you've actually read their website this is basically your

188
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,800
 shibboleth for whether I've read your tough report isn't it yes something like that oh my god that's

189
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:18,000
 amazing one of the professors at um Lester when I was an undergraduate um taught the

190
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,680
 statistical inference course and he was planning to write it up into a book so um in the um course

191
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,040
 notes it basically said if you could find five typos I will give you a book voucher for 20 quid

192
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,320
 apparently I was the only person in the history of his teaching career to ever find the five typos

193
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,440
 and collect my book voucher but I was like free book voucher I'm not an idiot I'm an undergraduate

194
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,800
 with no money you know like books if he had done that with Claire Broly she'd have found five typos

195
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,600
 on the first page and he'd have been very shocked they'd all have been things like this

196
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,040
 comma appears to be in Helvetica 14 not 12 as someone who has had Claire edit him Claire's good

197
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,560
 at editing Claire taught me how to use semicolons correctly or no Claire taught me how not to use

198
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:09,680
 m dashes incorrectly are you sure it's not just that Claire corrected all of your I mean I feel

199
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,880
 like she made off of actually taught you to use semicolons correctly I'm pretty sure she did if

200
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,560
 you misuse a semicolon now I can it's class fault yep okay moving on from Claire's letter of

201
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:29,200
 color before I get into trouble there will definitely be semicolons of punctuation yes okay Mark

202
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,680
 Plummer wrote to us saying that he understands Claire had already written to us about this but

203
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,360
 the wittabix capsule was his work so I get the impression that Claire is in charge of writing

204
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,320
 the fanzines and Mark is in charge of sort of the engineering behind them. Mark's an extremely

205
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,280
 accomplished fan writer also as we do I know Mark it didn't yes it is the official position of the

206
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,320
 up to the podcast that barca claire are both extremely talented fan writers Britain's greatest

207
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,000
 living fan writers to you that's true Britain's greatest living fan writers I believe he does say

208
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,920
 that in the very niche area of wittabix related fanzines Claire is responsible for content and he

209
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,640
 is responsible for building Lego wittabix capsules yes I will wittabix related fanzines yes then that

210
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,640
 makes sense I think we could all agree he also fixed the lid on the recycling bin with an old

211
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,280
 rolling pin handle and some string she gets a wittabix for punctuation breakfast shouldn't I?

212
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,800
 I've got to I've got to oh yes I've got to read this out verbatim sorry in this fan household I

213
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,040
 am responsible for engineering projects such as making little Lego wittabix capsules and fixing

214
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,880
 the lid on the recycle bin with an old rolling pin handle and some string as well as ironing

215
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,560
 and putting things down in the wrong place Claire is responsible for wittabix related fanzines

216
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,440
 list making and putting things in the right place especially commerce that's true and we're

217
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,720
 we're in it was very good it made me chuckle quellot but yes and he also mentions that we mentioned

218
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,000
 that the wittabix fanzine is eligible in best fanzine hugo he says technically eligible I would

219
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,280
 define it as gloriously eligible and then he says thanks to octa the walk he finds himself in the

220
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,960
 personally surprising position of how he's something to nominate in the best fan cast category no

221
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,200
 you're not going to put that to the podcast john we we do not put things like that to the podcast

222
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,880
 we just say something like mark also said some very nice things about octa thought which we're

223
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,040
 going to which we're not going to repeat what we really want is not so much um

224
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,360
 not so much awards and recognitions as for more people to listen to the podcast and award and

225
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,640
 recognition does help with that so and wittabix we're also happy with wittabix uh you know don't

226
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,000
 please do not all send us wittabix definitely did not send me wittabix because as previously

227
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,280
 elaborated it might be complicated i i don't why people said it would be wittabix on the basis

228
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,280
 that it would save you a trip to wittra's it doesn't really though it does if people said enough wittabix

229
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:59,200
 please send wittabix in packages of 108 wittabix too i think so don't do that because mark a clair

230
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,960
 might and then you'll be then you feel really guilty oh i won't i'll be rolling around in my

231
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,840
 massive bathtub of wittabix okay so what we need now is for somebody to send john 108 wittabix

232
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,000
 and he then promises to roll around in a massive tub of wittabix and and fill it for the podcast

233
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:28,320
 my address is so Alex Holden got in touch with me about octa thought and um wants to point out

234
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,640
 she is in fact a folkie in this she likes and enjoys folk music even though he doesn't make folk music

235
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:42,240
 though there obviously is he makes concertinas he does make folk music um in that way and he says

236
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,640
 something else as well as i was going to say oh yeah and that he listened to most of our podcast

237
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,120
 whilst making my concertino which i thought it's pretty cool so he he he has said on his instagram

238
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,920
 that he listens to every podcast in the world you know just fast fast numbers of podcasts because

239
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,520
 that's what you do if you work with your hands um so just before we wrap up um please do if you

240
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,120
 are considering coming to punctuation um come along um we at the time that you are listening to this

241
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:16,240
 will be one day away so don't delay join now if you hear this sort of a week after it drops

242
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,320
 don't join it finished sorry yeah there you know send us your send us your reflections of the

243
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,520
 convention you didn't get so so next next episode will be punctuation aftermath i i mean we haven't

244
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,600
 really talked about what we're doing in the next episode that's that's not we don't

245
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,920
 have to do trailers for the next episode of octop do we we're not nearly that organized are we we

246
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,840
 don't know what we're talking about in the next episode until five minutes before the next episode

247
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:54,400
 if that all right Liz come on we're very organized that was the 18th episode of the octothor podcast

248
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:02,000
 and we will all see you at punctuation but for now it is goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

249
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,320
 and it's goodbye from me

250
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:29,040
 um and she's also sent us a photograph of a full english breakfast at her full english

251
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:35,920
 breakfast at virtual octacon um and she is planning a similar breakfast for punctuation i i think

252
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,160
 you should make the breakfast like a chapter heading because it's kind of a demonstration of

253
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,200
 what breakfast should be like at virtual conventions have you got this picture didn't didn't we cover

254
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,440
 that like two minutes ago in the podcast? it's a great idea Alison and if i hadn't said it two

255
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,840
 minutes ago it would definitely go in okay so i've seen all of my brain is fried

256
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:07,120
 i thought you were doing a bit and then i realized you were doing a bit uh anyway but yes

257
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,400
 crack it idea Alison i might leave your version in and take mine out i kind of wonder what i did

258
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,240
 i think you were probably distracted by um looking up other letters of coit or reading

259
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,560
 and i was i was distracted by reading Alison's letter of coit but i mean i think i must have been

260
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,600
 more than averagely distracted at that point because that's obviously the thing that caused us

261
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,080
 to be talking about poached eggs is the first place yes yes exactly exactly

262
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:39,760
 the theme music for this episode was fanfare for space by kevin mccloud at ncompetech.com
