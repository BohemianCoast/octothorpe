1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 Sorry, sorry, did I just make you? Did I just make you choke on some ice? I did not mean to.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,000
 No, no. I have very long ice cubes at the moment because...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Of the heat.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,940
 No, because I bought some trays that I thought would work as like single serving soup...

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,040
 ...freezing.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,640
 And they're too small for that, but they do make basically giant ice cube cuboids.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:31,640
 [Music]

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:39,640
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 108th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom...

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,200
 ...which is coming to you on the 25th of April 2024. I'm John Coxon...

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,760
 I'm Alison Scott...

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
 ...and I'm Liz Batty.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,760
 And we have some letters of comment.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,120
 In fact, we have a bumper mailbag due to not doing any letters of comment while you guys were at EasterCon.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,080
 Yes.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,240
 We got some quick comments on Blue Sky.

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,720
 Nula got "Why don't you love me out of the library?"

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,720
 And I think we made them sand.

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,600
 I'm sorry, I hope you enjoyed it as well, but yeah, it's quite traumatizing.

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,840
 And we also heard from Raj, who is recommending a place where John can go and get pizza crunch.

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,280
 What's pizza crunch?

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,840
 It came up.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
 It's something I heard about on a podcast I listened to called Octa Thorpe.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,600
 They had a recent episode in EasterCon where they discussed it.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,200
 But it is where you deep fry pizza.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,640
 Also deep fry pizza has a name that's not just deep fry pizza.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,400
 Yes.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
 It's pizza crunch.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,560
 Yes.

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,200
 OK, I understand that.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,280
 I'm a bit slow and I'm old, so it's hard for us to adopt new vocabulary.

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,480
 I'm looking forward to eating some bar-spark crunch when I'm in Glasgow.

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,640
 Oh, we're done with it's called "Milesbar", yeah.

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,400
 Think it's only pizza.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,320
 It's not a specific name.

35
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,640
 Yes, Scots people, right in.

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,400
 I think it's just for pizza.

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,600
 It's not like a generic "Anything Deep Fried" is something crunch.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
 Fish crunch.

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:14,920
 If listeners are interested to hear a detailed discussion of the deep frying of chocolate bars in Scotland,

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,920
 the episode of the Off-Menu podcast with Ian Stirling has a detailed discussion of the form

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,280
 and is thoroughly interesting.

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,360
 Are the glass regions going to write in or are they just going to be angry at John quietly?

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,400
 Hi, Meg.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,680
 We had a letter from Andy Openshore.

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,600
 Long-time listener, first time writer, maybe, said he finds Octa thought really helpful to get

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,720
 insight, which seems strange to me, but there we go.

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,600
 And he's coming to Glasgow, so we will see you there, Andy.

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,960
 He said, "Based on our recommendations, he has started watching For All Mankind,

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,680
 and he observes its similarities to Mary Robblett Coals, the Lady Astronaut Series."

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,960
 I don't think it's as similar as all that, but yes, I think he says the similarities are evident

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,880
 and was one inspired by the other.

52
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,120
 And I think many people have talked about this on the internet, who know a lot more about it than we do, Andy.

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,160
 And do you think the existence of For All Mankind might prevent a TV film adaptation

54
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,640
 of the Lady Astronaut from happening? You can never tell really, because sometimes books that

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,000
 like each other make it more likely that adaptations happen, and sometimes they make it less likely.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,160
 That wasn't very profound.

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,480
 And said one of the great positives of the book is the inclusion of a trans character,

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,800
 and appreciated that about the adventures of Amina L. Sirafi, which I have not read yet.

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,880
 But we'll be reading soon, ready for our Hugo episode, which has become a tradition now, I think.

60
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,640
 Andy asks whether or not there are other examples of historical SFF that have

61
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,800
 sort of foregrounded trans people in. I confess I do not read much historical SFF.

62
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,280
 I mostly read the SFF with lasers in, so if anyone does and has any recommendations,

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,920
 please write in, and we will convey them to Andy.

64
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,480
 Finally, the only other Hugo novel he's read yet is Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh,

65
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,240
 and he thinks it's fab and has wondered, wonders if any of the Octa thoughts have read it,

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,280
 and if so, what do you think? And I would refer you back to the episode where I picked it,

67
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,360
 which is...

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,560
 And obviously you have used the spreadsheet to work out what episode that was, because you saw

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:35,480
 that co-egg and thought I need the episode of... Well, though. All right, so fun fact, as Alison says,

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,160
 Liz picked it in episode 100, because Alison picked the coral bones that episode,

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,560
 not Some Desperate Glory. I read it after Liz picked it, Pollock. Yes!

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,720
 I am the trendsetter here. You have mentally decided you picked it because you liked it.

73
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,080
 I did like it. Good. We will come back to the Hugo finalists in a future episode before

74
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,840
 the voting deadline, so that we can tell everyone what we thought.

75
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,720
 I will note that, um, For All Mankind fails to get on the Hugo ballot this year, which I think...

76
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,760
 I mean, I didn't like the series very much, so I can't really argue with it, but I think it

77
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,600
 probably got knocked off because there's several Doctor Who's and Strangely Worlds on there.

78
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,840
 Yeah, no, no, um, I think when we discussed this in our nominations episode, you said you didn't

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,440
 like For All Mankind season 4, and I was like, "Oh, I can see that it might not be quite as

80
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,240
 sharp as season 3, but I think it's... I feel like it's setting things up for a season 5 that might

81
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,240
 not happen." So, you know. That will happen. They announced that season 5 Anna spinoff, did you see?

82
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,480
 A spinoff? Yeah, Star City, which sounds interesting.

83
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,440
 Spinoff of Russia leading up to the Russian moon landing. Oh, that sounds so good!

84
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,600
 It sounds way better. I'm way more excited for that than for season 5 of For All Mankind,

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,760
 to be honest, but... But despite just being you going, "Oh, you loved it when it was kind of

86
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,680
 alternate history," but now it's like possible future, it's less exciting.

87
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,480
 I think it's that... It's not because it's possible future. It's because the characters are

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,560
 no longer as interesting. Because this is the problem with For All Mankind, right? It's

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,520
 trying to basically do a very long time span by keeping in familiar characters,

90
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,640
 and it just leads to ludicrous situations. And then when they've introduced new characters,

91
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,480
 I don't think they've been done half as interestingly as the old ones were.

92
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,040
 So... And the original characters' natural arc has very much come to an end in most cases.

93
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,840
 Yeah. I've not watched... I've not watched season 4, but having been watching season 3,

94
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,560
 I am genuinely baffled that they are doing a season 5, because it does very much feel like

95
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,000
 season 3 could be the end of the natural arc of most of those characters. And I don't really

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,600
 understand how you get two extra seasons out of it, but we will see. Yeah, six seasons in a movie.

97
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,680
 It feels like a roleplay campaign that no one really wants to end, but the best days are behind

98
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,560
 it in a way, coming from a perspective of sheer ignorance, obviously. We also heard from Christopher

99
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:13,080
 Jay Garcia. Thank you to Chris, among other things, he's never heard of Maundy Thursday,

100
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,440
 we'll way back before he's to come in Chris Letter, chronology, by the way. He's never heard of Maundy

101
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,160
 Thursday before, and he says it's also WrestleMania Thursday. So I do propose that we rename Maundy

102
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:33,400
 Thursday to WrestleMania Thursday. He has that in common with Whisper AI, which also does not

103
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,080
 recognise Maundy Thursday. Ask me how I know, transcription software. Does it think it's

104
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,840
 WrestleMania Thursday though? Yeah. It does not change Maundy to WrestleMania, however, I'm going

105
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,560
 to go and do a global search and replace on previous transcripts, which will now confuse people.

106
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,600
 Where do you get that pull request, John? I'm not accepting a pull request. John, can I have

107
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:03,000
 admin rights? Then I can turn down our listen, pull request, please. Chris also points out that

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,760
 transcripts are very useful for historian types because they're very easily searched. Yeah.

109
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,920
 He also says that he is starting to record podcasts again, but in true Garcia standard,

110
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,720
 he doesn't listen before he publishes. Chris also emailed in on Octor Blive.

111
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,720
 Shall I do just selected quotes from Chris's email? British people are just weird.

112
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,680
 Burn down the business meeting. I'm infinitely funnier in my head, and is Telford in San

113
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:40,440
 Jose. Did you explain that last one? Yeah. The last one is because he says a

114
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,600
 town full of low to mid-range chain restaurants is Telford in San Jose. I just thought it was

115
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,640
 funnier to leave out the context. You were correct. I'm sorry. I did suggest on an

116
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:56,440
 anonymous Claire, the Nando's Index for Eastcon bids, and I'm sticking by it.

117
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,200
 A hypothetical Newcastle Gates head, Eastcon venue would have a Nando's Index of four. So this is

118
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,240
 proof if needed that this is just a very good indicator of quality of venue. He throw gets zero.

119
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,640
 What is going on in Newcastle Gates head? Why do you have so many Nando's? I thought you would

120
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,840
 be very high on like the Greg's Index, but not the Nando's. I have already said surely it has a

121
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,720
 Greg's Index. Oh, mate, you want to know how many you want to know how many Greg's are there?

122
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,680
 God, I'll tell you the answer to that. There's way more than four.

123
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,760
 Can you never more than a six foot from a Greg's in Newcastle? I'm proud. There are also a variety

124
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,720
 of very lovely restaurants, but it is a big city and therefore it has Greg's and Nando's

125
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,600
 in many equal measures. I think the Greg's Index would be one, two, three, four, five, six,

126
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,800
 seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. I think it'd be thirteen walkable, although some

127
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,200
 are more walkable than others. Right. I hope John is now investigating a Newcastle Gates head

128
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,120
 bit where we can all go out for a cheeky Nando's. Raj wrote to us on Mastodon as well. It seems

129
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,600
 like Blue Sky is for Pizza Crunch and Mastodon is for serious commentary. I don't know whether

130
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,600
 that's true. Raj says he enjoyed Nicholas White as stunt Liz and loved the April Fool's Hugo trophy,

131
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,360
 but then says, "I do think declining the nomination is a classy move on Bigelest

132
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,400
 Ticklers is part, but I'm not really sure how it got nominated in the first place. That whole

133
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,680
 thing was funny, but I'm not convinced a tweet was worth the best-related work nod."

134
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,360
 It's just such a weird grab bag category, and I think the more weird grab bag things get nominated,

135
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,360
 people think, "Well, this is a grab bag for anything I liked in fandom last year."

136
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,160
 But in previous years, we've had stuff like Firecon and Conziel and Fringe get nominated,

137
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,120
 the judge are marching, can fuck off into the sun, SA got nominated, and various other things

138
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,560
 have been nominated. And certainly over the pandemic, that got more common, it seems to me,

139
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,560
 and this just seems to be another example of that. I'm very glad that the eventualist to finalist

140
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,120
 is mostly things I can engage with as art and then work out, which is the best, which this is

141
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,600
 actually the strongest slate, I think, for some time. I agree with that. I think 2021, it's possible

142
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:14,680
 that there were fewer of the serious overarching books that we think are great in this category

143
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,960
 than you would normally expect published in 2020, and that was the reason for more of the

144
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:26,360
 memey things getting on the ballot in 2021. To the long list. I think it's just, you know,

145
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,200
 there are things that people want to celebrate, but I still think of best-related workers being

146
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,240
 like, you know, it's the one place on the Hugo ballot we can celebrate essays and works of

147
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:45,240
 criticism and art books, of which there are, you know, a good number of really interesting ones.

148
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,760
 And so it's a shame to kind of have like a tweet that went viral in a very interesting and fun,

149
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,040
 but totally random manner. I don't know, it's how am I supposed to judge that against an actual,

150
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,480
 like retrospective book of critical essays across someone's career?

151
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,280
 And fortunately you don't have to. Fortunately I don't have to, so I favor keeping it towards

152
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,480
 that end of things.

153
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,280
 When I was saying 2021, Firecon and Consi-land Fringe pushed Liam McCormack's biology and manners,

154
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,640
 essays on Lois McMaster-Bajold and Burrows is the magic of Terry Pratchett off the ballot,

155
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,160
 both of which I think would have been better presences on the finalists late than two conventions

156
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,400
 that were never going to win the award. And indeed they did not. So yeah.

157
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,600
 Because that's the other thing. When voters get their hands on best-related work,

158
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,960
 Alison is right. Like the memes tend to be unlikely to actually clinch the win.

159
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:47,080
 Consi-land Fringe came below no award in Best Related in 2021 and Firecon did better.

160
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,680
 But this year it seems good.

161
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,080
 Yep, no it's got some great things on it. It's a good award. Oh sorry, it's a good slate.

162
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,560
 And I'm very glad to see a travel in time, the critical practice of Maureen Kincaid's

163
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,560
 speller on the ballot. But I do wish we had celebrated Maureen Kincaid's speller when she was alive

164
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,640
 instead of waiting until it was too late. So one of the nominees for Best Related Work is a

165
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,440
 travel in time, the collected works of Maureen Kincaid's speller. And unfortunately, obviously,

166
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,520
 Maureen will not be with us at the time of the Hugo Awards. So I think it is a shame that there

167
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,960
 was no collection of her work during her lifetime. But maybe this is going to change in future with

168
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,440
 criticism because I noticed that Briardine Books, Friends of the Podcast, have announced their

169
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,200
 second collection of essays. That was the exact point I was going to make, which is that the sad

170
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,080
 thing here is that Maureen's work wasn't collected in her lifetime despite being eminently suitable

171
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:52,520
 for it. And I think had Neil been publishing books, these amazing books, she's obviously

172
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,640
 one of the people that he'd have looked at to publish. Yes, but now we can also plug to let his book.

173
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,000
 Yeah, so he's publishing Abigail's book, which I think John has copy edited. Is that right John

174
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,520
 or laid out or both? I don't- I type set. Type set. Yes, it is coming. Yeah, no, I have pre-ordered it.

175
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,920
 Oh, we have had a lock in real time. Do you want the real time lock?

176
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:25,160
 Meg McDonald. Oh. In chat, she says, "Letter of comment from the Peanut Gallery. I appreciate

177
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,560
 that you all have suitably dirty laughs. This is presumably an opt-to-thought live."

178
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,960
 So, presumably you two and Nicholas have dirty laughs and I have a very clean one.

179
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:40,280
 Yes, I mean, I feel like it's that- because Nicholas does have quite a- quite a dirty laugh,

180
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,760
 in fact. Well, that's the feedback we are getting from our audience. So, is Nicholas regretting being

181
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,240
 on opt-to-thought live yet? He probably was at the time someone climbed under a table.

182
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,800
 I like the use of the word "yet" as if it's a foregone conclusion that he will regret it.

183
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 It's just a matter of when. I do understand that he has written to the other lovely podcast

184
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,680
 find list. Hello, lovely, other lovely podcast find list if you're listening, offering to go on

185
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:16,040
 their podcast. Oh. That is screw-pulously fair of him. That is very fair. It's tricky, right? Because

186
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:22,680
 yeah, no, that is fair. I like that. At the live show, I asked people to write in with their thoughts

187
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:31,480
 on the accessibility of the EastCon venue and I specifically asked DC in a chance encounter in

188
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,880
 the hallways before that and DC is very kindly obliged and written as a lock. I will publish the

189
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,880
 full lock on my website and I will link it from the show notes because it'll be good if people can

190
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:48,040
 go and read it in its entirety but I will pick out some key bits and bobs here and we can go through

191
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,760
 it and then we will segue seamlessly into wider discussion of the EastCon and the EastCon venue.

192
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:01,080
 DC wrote in to say, the first thing to say is that there are problems. If you're a non-ambulatory

193
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,200
 wheelchair user, if you need assistance in the toilet or if you need a hoist transfer, then there

194
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:12,120
 are real problems with the venue and yet this remains one of the best venues, if not the best

195
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:19,720
 in total for wheeled users and then they say deep sigh. And so yeah, DC's perspective is very

196
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,640
 much this is a flawed venue. This is a venue that has problems but it is probably the best venue we

197
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:33,880
 have been to as an EastCon if you require access in a wheeled conveyance and then they go into more

198
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:41,160
 details about that. So DC says, the location of the centre has challenges, it's in quite a hilly

199
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,040
 area and some of the road and footpath surfaces aren't even, the routes to the centre of Telford

200
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,280
 and in the other direction to the onsite hotels both involve in places steep gradients and the route

201
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,800
 to the onsite hotels is not well illuminated at night, there's a lot of unevenness in the surface.

202
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,960
 There is at least one curb which is supposed to be dropped and isn't. People have been talking

203
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,360
 about this in some conversations I've seen but this does seem to be a recurring feature of the

204
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,600
 criticisms. They did seem to be doing work on the path from the conventions enter to the onsite

205
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:19,480
 hotels so I assume that that will improve things but I don't know. Some of these factors are relevant

206
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,320
 to other people as well as people with disabilities so the fact that the night time routes are badly

207
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:31,880
 lit is relevant for lots of people, not merely people who are who have mobility issues and that

208
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,480
 all of the routes to the all of none of the hotels are quite on site so everybody has some

209
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:47,160
 walking to do to get to their accommodation but again overall I thought this venue had a lot

210
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,680
 going for it for people with a range of needs.

211
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,200
 And I think it's also, Levitation had like an access audit on their website. I think it shows

212
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,960
 the importance of doing the access audit not just in your venue but someone ideally needs to like

213
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,440
 walk from the station to the venue at night and see if it's got unusual humps on the path or it's

214
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,760
 on lit or anything like that. And then I guess ideally someone would also go to the site just

215
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,520
 before the con to see if anyone has moved things around or if there is engineering work or if there

216
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,560
 is building work or anything like that. Because yeah it's not just having an accessible venue it's

217
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,480
 where the people can actually get to your accessible venue with any sort of ease.

218
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,200
 It was clearly easier for people with mobility issues to be in the attached hotels rather than

219
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,360
 the budget hotels that were a little way away. They were only about a five minute walk, a 10

220
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,160
 minute walk late at night. But that might be something that a bursary that bursary payments are

221
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,960
 useful for is bridging that gap for people who do need to be in the more expensive hotels

222
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,040
 but would otherwise choose the cheaper ones.

223
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,240
 Yeah I think Bradford, because we used to have split hotels for Bradford and I think there was a

224
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,640
 process where if you had access needs you could be guaranteed a room in the main hotel but I don't

225
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,080
 know how much help Bradford gave fans with the cost of that. Well the same for the Helsinki Worldcon.

226
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,960
 We routinely give people access to close hotels but yes they're the most expensive ones and

227
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,000
 and that's the that could be a significant for Telford it was a significant extra cost because

228
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,360
 I always stay in the main hotel and I was like oh Prebirin looks good.

229
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,840
 I was saying it was the same for the Helsinki Worldcon which has that one hotel attached to

230
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,280
 the convention center which was quite expensive and everyone else was basically a train ride away.

231
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,560
 But we did do some work going on to the trains and trams with wheelchair users

232
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,120
 to see how easy it was to use those to get around and things like that. So then you could recommend

233
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,680
 okay well if you don't want to stay in that expensive hotel this hotel is also suitable and

234
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,800
 we have tested that there's a step free route on the trains and things like that.

235
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,640
 No DC does say jumping towards the end of the lock. They didn't have a lot of interaction with

236
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,360
 venue staff but when they did it was clear that the staff had had training about how to help people

237
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,360
 with wheels and especially how not to which is also better than an average venue in DC's experience.

238
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,480
 DC talks a little bit about the inside of the venue so the first unpleasant surprise is that

239
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,000
 there are slopes in the building and you can't get to the passenger list without going up a

240
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,720
 slope on the ground floor. They're not very steep but it's a bit of effort that would really be

241
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,840
 better and then on the first floor there's another slope which is on the first floor there's another

242
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:36,760
 slope which is worse. It's steeper and carpeted and DC needed help to get up it every time they tried.

243
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,640
 They say fans are pretty good offering help but it's not good that it's essential and I know Doug

244
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,440
 Spencer has said on various places like if you need access to be provided like on request then it's

245
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:55,320
 not access. I think the thing that as someone who is not disabled it's not helpful to say that in a

246
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:02,120
 vacuum like if this venue is better than other venues I assume in other venues you also have to

247
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,480
 ask for things and if you have to ask more than this one this one is still better even if it's

248
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,040
 still not perfect and I guess part of the thing here is coming back to DC's point that this is

249
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:19,480
 probably you know in the top tier of accessibility as far as East Comm venues go so like do bear in

250
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,080
 mind listener that like you know if this sounds awful this is... think about how bad the other

251
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:30,680
 places must be. I guess it's the point like think about the challenges that other venues must hold.

252
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,280
 Telford seemed quite flat to me with the exception of the hill up to the town but I don't know why

253
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,880
 they've put slopes in on the on the floors it might have been an unavoidable thing based on where

254
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,360
 they were building. I felt one of the things I felt about the venue in terms of access provision

255
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,520
 was that it was clearly built just before the point where all of this would have been done in

256
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,240
 quite a different way and so things like there is no escalator from the ground floor to the first

257
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:08,440
 floor and clearly there ought to be just staircases. The very small lift the internal slopes there

258
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,600
 are quite a lot of internal places where you had a choice between us a fairly steep slope actually

259
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,240
 or or steps and you just think well this is all the sort of thing that's been designed out of

260
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,680
 buildings of this kind in the last 20 years so I don't know when it got built but it feels like

261
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,520
 it was just before we started to take accessibility of this sort of space seriously.

262
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,760
 So living in somewhere where access is I think a little bit behind the UK and probably where the

263
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,920
 UK was you know 20-25 years ago they are in some places putting ramps in but the ramps are just

264
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,160
 incredibly steep and I can't see anyone ever being able to self-propell up them and to be honest

265
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:54,040
 they'd be quite hard to push a lot of people up them. Sometimes ramp is not ramp. Going to lift

266
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,440
 there's only one passenger lift and there's a goods lift so the passenger lift is like a problem

267
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,160
 because obviously if the lift breaks down a goods lift would be the only option. The goods lift was

268
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,640
 the route people using mobility scooters had to use because the passenger lift was too small if

269
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,480
 there were no staff they had to phone for someone to come and work the lift. I gather this went

270
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,320
 mostly okay but sometimes there was a delay and they just had to wait for someone to come

271
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,880
 and that is like another clear negative of the site. They do have planning permission for an

272
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,040
 extension which would include a second lift but we don't know what the status of. That is but

273
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:36,280
 DC does say in asterisks this is not the smallest lift we've had at an east convenue that is worth

274
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:42,840
 bearing in mind again. The radison at e-throw has some tiny lifts. I do remember a site visit

275
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,400
 watching someone basically maneuver a mobi in there to check you could actually get them in and it

276
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,200
 did require a bit of skillful driving but I don't remember us breaking them at any point so we

277
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,200
 probably did a quite a skillful job but they were kind of just big enough some of the lift at the

278
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:03,080
 back. Then DC wraps up by saying they have a lot of detailed thoughts about toilets. Basically saying

279
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,720
 the toilet provision is not great. They weren't terrible for DC but for someone significantly less

280
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:16,440
 mobile would have much more of a problem and goes into a lot of detail on that and notes. I won't

281
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,720
 go into all the detail but I will pull out this is the one aspect in which the TIC seems worse

282
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,040
 than most other east convenues which is bizarre given the scope of the place that there really

283
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,280
 needs to be an accessible toilet on each floor which is twice the size if not larger than any of

284
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:36,200
 the existing toilets. So that is I think as far as I can tell that's the big criticism DC has of

285
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,440
 the size is that the toilet provision is not up to snuff. There were some discussions of accessibility

286
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,880
 in the lead up to the convention but I don't think anyone was annoyed about the toilets but

287
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:54,200
 as far as I could tell the toilets are one of the worst bits so I did not know that thank you DC.

288
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,760
 It's probably very easy to go oh there is an accessible toilet great and nothing quite the

289
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,160
 fact that if you're on a different floor and you're only access to the toilet is a good

290
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,280
 lift where you have to phone someone to get them to use it and that's also a big barrier to that.

291
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:14,520
 DC sort of has some generic notes on east cons which is basically if a room has two doors

292
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,920
 don't bolt one of the doors shut that seems like good coherent advice makes sense

293
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,360
 and then the other one is when you have program rooms that are laid out in cabaret style that

294
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,800
 can make it a lot harder for wheeled users and so when you do that I think we probably need to

295
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,840
 have someone try and navigate the layout in wheels like prior to the convention starting to make

296
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:44,120
 sure that it isn't pain in the arse for someone with wheels but yes those are good points as well.

297
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,960
 Yeah I mean normally when we lay out cabaret style it's because we're expecting things to have

298
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,760
 a slightly smaller you know an audience who will appreciate that but as maybe smaller than it

299
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,880
 would be if you laid it out theatre style so it should be it should be possible to put a big

300
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,320
 island there I'm just saying I mean I don't think we necessarily say oh access requires us to make

301
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,920
 every every seat in that room capable of having a wheelchair at. I'm not a wheel user and I don't

302
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,360
 have a lot to add to this I mean I think this is something we should take seriously I do think

303
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,640
 as with everything on access it has to be balanced with the other access needs of the of the members

304
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,800
 that you know we know that it's not always possible to accommodate all of the things that

305
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,880
 everybody needs we we we took a view with conversation that we would be quite clear about what we could

306
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,480
 and could not accommodate as a standard in advance and then if people needed more than that we would

307
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,520
 see what we could do to help. And so that kind of segues into something the 2024 committee has

308
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,520
 said that Telford was the cheapest venue they looked at to run their east con in and I assume

309
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:54,280
 that it is true that if we were using a more expensive venue it would be more modern and it would

310
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,960
 have less of these problems and part of this might get into a discussion in the future on a future

311
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,080
 episode on the expense of holding east con then you get into a thing of kind of discussing very

312
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,360
 carefully the implications for wealth privilege in the community and that is a discussion we will

313
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,040
 have in the future if you have any thoughts on that please do let us know.

314
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,640
 We've been talking about Telford listeners Telford Telford.

315
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,880
 I had never been to Telford I don't think. I've been to the KFC in Telford on account of how

316
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,720
 it's a convenience stopping place when I go cotaging it turned out the hotel that I had booked for me

317
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,600
 in España and that near the nick then decided to book was opposite that KFC so I felt right at home.

318
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 Telford's fine like you know. Well and that's the other thing transport privilege right where

319
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,320
 Telford is three and a half hours away from everywhere which sounds great until you realize it's not

320
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,800
 that it's up to three and a half hours away from everywhere it is literally three and a half hours

321
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:02,520
 away from everywhere. It says it's within three hours of 90 percent of the country and people were

322
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,080
 like oh they don't mean Scotland but in fact 90 percent of the population I can believe but

323
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,880
 it's kind of perfect travel time most people it's gonna take longer than three hours much of the time

324
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,200
 because it'd be telling us I think two hours 48 minutes right up until we left the house on

325
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,120
 boardy Thursday. How did you find traveling to Telford Liz? It was good I just opened up

326
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:32,840
 my members portal and I clicked on the link and I could wait for people in the auditorium

327
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,480
 in several cases I WhatsApp them to say I can see you which probably did not go down as well as I

328
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,240
 thought it would have. Yeah I think people maybe did not realize that the streaming was streaming

329
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,080
 the panel rooms before the panel opened and they were showing the audience but it was nice to see

330
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,120
 people. We did that last year too. I think we might be moving gently into the online bit but we do

331
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,680
 want to say a little bit about the members portal because I've been doing catch up and the members

332
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:02,360
 portal which was put together by Andrew January and means that you have a kind of seamless

333
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:09,240
 integration that means you're logged into the discord and the ring's central events and the guide

334
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:16,600
 all at once and you can just carry on watching your catch up without having to continuously

335
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:22,200
 re-authenticate or wonder where you left it. It was one link that had links to everything else.

336
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:31,800
 It was great. Well done Andrew. Yes I've having done some like online stuff for punctuation.

337
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:39,640
 I am a little bit in awe of how much Andrew has done for levitation and I think he has an

338
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:46,840
 eye towards trying to make some of this available for other conventions to use. So yeah it is but it

339
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,400
 is like stuff like having a discord bot that can authenticate your discord account and then

340
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:58,200
 make sure that you're always in the convention discord and building like the members portal as

341
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,480
 you said and all of that is just very impressive stuff. And they meant that they didn't I was

342
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,320
 watching the discord moderator's channel and they did not have to they were only like a few

343
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:15,000
 a handful of people who had problems getting into the discord and everyone else found it smooth so

344
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,800
 that's kind of good. Yeah it was great. Remember how much time and effort Acecons have had to put

345
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,240
 into like checking everyone is actually on the members list and cross checking and making sure

346
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,000
 everyone can join and making sure no one has two discord accounts in the wrong name.

347
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,480
 It was so smooth I just clicked on it. I mean I've played it several times because discord is not

348
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,440
 that smooth integrated but it did work. It's great. The other thing I really liked about the

349
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,600
 members portal is it had a link to a tip jar for tipping the TIC staff without needing cash

350
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,520
 because I always feel guilty when the hat comes around but the closing ceremony and I haven't

351
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,480
 got any coins in my pocket because I haven't done fiers so having a place I could like tip

352
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,600
 without needing any coins was very good. Yes that was great. I felt bad for several years

353
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,400
 that I never managed to be organizing off to have a tip because yeah you never pay in cash anymore.

354
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,280
 Unfortunately they closed the tip jar before I thought well I started to watch the catch up.

355
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:14,280
 Oh there's a tip jar I should tip and discovered it was closed already so next time guys leave

356
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:20,840
 have a tip jar that stays open or probably a second tip jar for people who are doing the catch up

357
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,320
 and remembering that they should have tipped because that would be good. It may just be me

358
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,640
 but I bet it's not. So I have been watching the catch up though this is a convention that

359
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,160
 like a cheeky nandos has been repeating on me for weeks. I've never had members repeat on me

360
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,880
 how dare you. Actually nandos is lovely. Wont hear a word said again but I would say

361
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:47,000
 younger people have castor iron stomachs and older people just saying. Okay I've seen now. Fair enough.

362
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,360
 Yeah so I have watched more easter con program than not merely at any time for the last several

363
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,200
 years but possibly for every easter con combined but probably not quite. I used to watch quite a

364
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,360
 lot of program at the beginning but I've watched a lot of program this year. I'll catch up. I've watched

365
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:10,840
 I think about 14 or 15 items which is lots. I'm not counting octa thought live which I

366
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,520
 woefully said I was listening to for the fifth time the other day but I think I am done with it now.

367
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,360
 Only one of those was optional I think. The other four were mandatory. Yeah because

368
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,200
 Alison does the transcript so has to listen to it to make sure it's okay to go out and then has

369
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,840
 to listen to it to edit the transcript so. Yeah and then we also listen to it to the car coming

370
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:37,160
 and then I listen to it with somebody at some point so there we go. Five. A lot. Two. Wait you

371
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:44,440
 listen to it in the car coming home from easter con. Okay. Listeners cannot see lizzes absolutely

372
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:51,240
 baffled face but take it from me it's great. Right so I have to force myself to listen to it

373
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,040
 once to check it's okay and then I'm like no I never want to listen to myself again so. No no no

374
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,920
 it wasn't wasn't me. We worked out that so one of the things that was good about re-essential

375
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:07,320
 events is that it would stream the not all programs do this but it would stream the audio to the

376
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,480
 car for carplay and I said right so we've got the catch up what does everyone want to listen to

377
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,600
 and there was a chorus of oh could we do octa thought live please so it was my choice it was

378
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,000
 my family I played my family I mean I enjoy that they were listening to it on catch up because

379
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,840
 because they did not come to your program item. Stephen did come to the program item but don't

380
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,200
 think Marianne and Jonathan did. Marianne and Jonathan didn't come to the program item and

381
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,680
 Stephen I said Stephen to run some errands because we were trying to sort out the newsletter I think

382
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,360
 at the same time yeah yeah so I don't really know what to watch on catch up because levitation has

383
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:53,480
 not shared the catch up stats and I I mean this is a choice but in the same way that there was a

384
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,800
 point where Nicholas said last time that the hugos belong to the voters I feel like these to come

385
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:06,680
 belongs to its membership and it's clearly useful information for members to know what things are

386
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,560
 getting views on catch up in the same way that they can see what program items are busy when they go

387
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,720
 into the program room and I think that convention should release the catch up stats a take I mean

388
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:26,360
 I think I think I agree I don't think I think it's a philosophical point for me so Alison when

389
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,160
 you're trying to pick what program I used to watch live do you go into all the program rooms and

390
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,600
 search one has the most people in and go and sit in that one sorry I feel like you you suggested

391
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:42,440
 the time I choose to watch a program item live the time not actually on or required to be at yeah

392
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,960
 no I'm just making the analogy if you're saying you know you should have the stats like you can see

393
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,120
 how many people in a room is that how you actually pick program and I can also see the view that if

394
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:56,040
 you are on an item and the catch up shows that basically no one has watched it then that could be

395
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,120
 quite demoralizing just like if you're on a program item and two people come to watch it

396
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,080
 except then the stats are there for everyone to see so I can see the argument against no I'm doing a

397
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,720
 little bit of but actually if we're going to have convers I know that they've got the data and they

398
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,280
 got the data on people in rooms as well if we're going to have conversations about what sorts of

399
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,440
 things should be programming in particular what sorts of things we should be programming when

400
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,400
 because one of the things about the convention is that they programmed a lot of very serious panels

401
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,760
 really late in the evening and they program quite a lot of lighthearted stuff at 10 o'clock in the

402
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,520
 morning and I would like to see more more thought when people are likely to want that sort of thing

403
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,400
 so and this sort of data is useful I just like data really that's the thing I mean I like data

404
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,600
 obviously but I think there is a philosophical argument here which is how much weight should we

405
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,400
 put on what people want to watch by how much they watch on catch up and how much weight should we

406
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,520
 give to what people watch when they are actually physically at the convention or indeed watching

407
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,640
 not on catch up but live streaming from the con because they'll kind of give you an idea like do

408
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,960
 if you put something serious on very late at night and no one actually goes to the room physically

409
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,880
 but a bunch of people then watch on catch up later it probably still wasn't the right decision to

410
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:17,160
 put it on at that time also I note that if I go to the conversation website there's no stats on

411
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,840
 program watching on there either so no what we did last year was release was release the kind

412
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,520
 of greatest hits we released the top ones which I think is is is a compromise here so there must

413
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:37,240
 not miss items yeah I could see that it would be interesting to see kind of how they compare to

414
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,400
 you know things watched on site versus things that were streamed and certainly like do more people

415
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,840
 stream science program is there bits of program that no one ever wants to stream because that all

416
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,920
 my I also be if you need to choose how many items you're able to stream then you can pick which one

417
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,400
 people are less likely to watch and not stream it that kind of thing yeah I haven't seen your

418
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,640
 the conversation list of top ones I would like to see that I think some of the information is

419
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,600
 being shared with Glasgow which I think will be quite useful because I think they do have these

420
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,760
 counts they know how many people streamed live and how many people were in the room and how many

421
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:15,880
 people are watching on catch up and I think this is quite useful interesting data for program teams

422
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:23,000
 yarrick yeah so I just had to guess and I have I've this is part of our kind of general argument I

423
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,040
 have in general enjoyed the talks more than the panels I I would observe that most of the 157 items

424
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:36,200
 on catch up are talks or panels there's not a lot of alternate things there are a few but there aren't

425
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:43,480
 all that many I think it's worth noting that the room where a lot of the items that were happening

426
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,720
 that were not really talks or panels was not being streamed also if one person if I have

427
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:55,000
 person panel doesn't want to put on catch up then it's not on catch up whereas for talks only one

428
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,920
 person has to grieve for it to be on catch up I mean I I'd be quite I think we're now at the point

429
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,080
 where it would not be unreasonable to say that unless unless you've got something absolutely

430
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:11,080
 amazing you can put on the program but with a with a person who won't let it be streamed or

431
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:17,240
 catch up then I think that's okay but for everything else the rule should be if you want to be on

432
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,560
 the program you're going to be all streaming and catch up I think my opinion on that is dictated

433
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,840
 a little bit by percentages of how many people actually opt out very few because if like only

434
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,520
 yeah like because like my impression of it is that it's less than 1% of people actually have a

435
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,520
 problem with it and so yes I think that's probably fair but if it was like 25% I'd be like well no

436
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:47,400
 you and that gets tricky I mean basically I guess my worry is if the percentages high enough that

437
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,920
 you suspect it might be acting to remove diverse voices from program I'd probably think it was

438
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,960
 problematic but I don't think it actually would do that so I think it would be fine I would be

439
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,880
 paying attention to whether or not I thought my opinion on that was changing I guess is but

440
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,240
 it's an interesting it's definitely an interesting sort of thing to talk about and also I think

441
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,480
 obviously the benefit to widening participation in the people who can actually engage with the

442
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:20,360
 program probably acts in such a positive way in terms of diverse voices that that probably

443
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:26,920
 outweighs any penalty I'm not sure yeah I would say conversely the number of people opting out I

444
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,920
 think is small enough that you don't bother about it we just have a handful of things that aren't

445
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,280
 streamed that's okay or rather I think a lot of things there were in in this case it's not that

446
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,240
 they weren't streamed I think it's that they were streamed but they're not available on

447
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,040
 catch-up in some cases so you had to watch them live and I think that's fine how was the bar though

448
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:50,520
 did everyone just go to bed when the bar closed no it's it worked really well it was great I have

449
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:57,080
 a whole thing about this can I can I have a theory so Liz it was amazing I think it might have been

450
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,280
 the besties to come bar I've ever been to and I have a theory as to why which was basically what

451
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,760
 would happen was everyone would be sitting in the TIC and they'd be having a bevy and there was some

452
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,640
 real ale until we drank it all and then like come half 10 or half 11 depending on the night we all

453
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,880
 had to go over to the holiday inn and that was really good because it took everyone who had been

454
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,840
 sitting where they were sitting through the evening and it jumbled everyone up and you saw people you

455
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,360
 hadn't noticed we're in the bar and you got into new groups and then you went to the holiday inn you

456
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,160
 sat down in different groups and you had entirely new conversations with different people and it

457
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,960
 was so dynamic and great and I have no idea if it would scale with higher membership numbers

458
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,960
 because the holiday inn is a finite space but the international hotels bar was almost empty so I

459
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:47,160
 don't know whether we'd be able to sort of spread out I will say the beers in the hotels were fine

460
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,840
 to pour but that was also quite good because it meant after I'd had sort of 15 beers by 11 I could

461
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,480
 just switch to tap water and then when I got to bed I was only mildly pissed instead of utterly

462
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,480
 stinking so yes I thought it was good the holiday inn were also pretty nice to us they clearly have

463
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:10,600
 very great experience of people turning up after they've been kicked out of the TIC that is clearly

464
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,760
 their entire business model and unlike some hotels that are in that position they just basically

465
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,680
 were there they were very happy to sell beer to a lot of different people and it was comfortable

466
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,520
 space I think yes a larger reason to call would have had to use both the bars the bar in the

467
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,520
 international as well as the bar in the Hilton they stopped serving kind of two-ish it was fine

468
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,920
 it was good what was your because my theory about the real ale was that they bought the right

469
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,720
 about and it sold out and that's what should happen because it sold out about seven or six

470
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,720
 o'clock on the Sunday which is about what you want I think um I think thought they probably needed

471
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,680
 a little bit more real ale I agree with you that selling out of the real ale on the sunday is

472
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,000
 probably desirable but I was a little bit grumpy that they sold out of all the nice real ale on the

473
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,920
 Saturday and I feel that is a bit early it's the lopean brewery is fine um and it's the local brewery

474
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,800
 so I appreciate I think having the local brewery is good but um but they don't necessarily have the

475
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,880
 range of beers I enjoy as much claire brierly on the other hand did and then I was quite drunk

476
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,440
 and I blame claire brierly okay oh oh that that night when we just locked ourselves in the newsletter

477
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,480
 room and drank beer very rapidly for some time until all the lights went out Liz and then we were

478
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,880
 like oh we should probably go to the holiday in that did you almost get locked in the newsletter

479
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,400
 room oh we're light that'd be quite funny oh so pissed that was the night that I basically oh I

480
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,400
 got I got very bawdled in the holiday in and and mowed at people and and totally because I believe

481
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,760
 I'm quite a cheerful drunk so being a miserable drunk was very bad I I think um I think you're an

482
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,200
 intense drunk I think you've definitely been a slightly mordling drunk at me I used to come

483
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,800
 I'm afraid really sorry it's probably like in this like post-covid era whenever one was a little

484
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,400
 bit more you know intense I would quite like the bar to be slightly more comfortable I mean not

485
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,600
 the bar in the holiday in which was fine the bar in the self-ditch national center I like I like

486
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:14,440
 proper chairs but I mean like any chairs are better than no chairs so you know yeah and wasn't

487
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,560
 there a big faffet long-come that like convention centers are not filled with like a big abundance

488
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:24,760
 of comfy chairs for bars yeah there were the same chairs that we had at long-corn in the bar area

489
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,280
 but we had a lot of different seating options in that big fan village space so I think I do I do

490
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,000
 wonder whether a larger East con would have been able to put more budget towards having some

491
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,720
 comfier spaces but I think that's the sort thing that is fixable but might be tricky um

492
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,320
 what was the membership by the way I maybe didn't read all the newsletters on site was something

493
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:53,240
 like 450 yeah it's a really good size oh so quite but quite small as East con's go yeah very small

494
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,120
 for at least god there are numerous venues that we don't look at because they're too small for

495
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,880
 at least a call that you could have put that East con in practice because it ended up smaller

496
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:08,120
 than we expected yeah how did you find the social side of things liz online or not really I didn't

497
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,920
 mean you anything cool this was because I did not time shift so functional i was going to bed at

498
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,280
 you know 6 p.m before anyone was really into party time but I also don't think there was much

499
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,640
 arranged it was just I could join a discord voice channel and I am not sort of person to randomly

500
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,240
 join discord voice channels while sitting at home and doing that if you want if you want social

501
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:35,000
 events on your discord or or online spaces you have to actually have somebody whose job it is to

502
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,320
 make those things happen it's it's quite a lot of work it's not something I could do whilst actually

503
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:47,400
 going to a convention if I ever find I cannot go to conventions because of injury or illness I will

504
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,400
 definitely volunteer for that job if I ever catch if I ever test positive for covid on

505
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,800
 body Thursday I will spend my weekend sorting out online spaces at least god I mean it did feel that

506
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,840
 the virtual vision was good and they had discord channels to chat in and I happily watched items

507
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,040
 and chatted on discord with people who were in the room and that was all very nice

508
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,560
 and so I felt the virtual option was quite reasonably priced for what I got but if I wanted like a

509
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,520
 full social kind experience it wasn't really that on the plus side no one called me drunkenly

510
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:23,960
 from the calm so I am winning there I mean I will drunkenly call you later thank you John

511
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,720
 we kind of texted you during the panel though didn't we um I think I uh message John with

512
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:35,560
 some jokes that didn't go in the port no no but you did not at any point you have in the past for

513
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:42,840
 example phone me up from a calm at like 6 a.m so 6 a.m my time I should say we're great friends

514
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:50,520
 yeah and it was nice but also no so I'm viewing it as a plus that no one wants up to me at 6 a.m

515
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,560
 well there was probably a good reason right there was a good reason and we planned it we did I still

516
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:03,160
 regretted it yeah so so if anyone wants the jokes that we edited out of the or that John edited out

517
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,640
 of the live version of optophobe if you're an easter con member it's still available in its

518
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:14,520
 unexpagated form on catch up yes so go watch it there for another couple of weeks couple of weeks

519
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,920
 I've watched some catch up but I need to watch more about 10 days by the time it's you're actually

520
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,680
 listening to this so yeah get over yeah do it do it now now stop what you're doing pull over watch

521
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:30,760
 the program do I want to do we want to recommend any particular items that people should watch or

522
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,360
 can I do ones that I watched in person yeah or is that cheating that's okay like you were to watch

523
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,280
 them on catch up but you'd already seen them so that's fine I can recommend ones that I watch

524
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:47,240
 when they were streamed live so yeah if I'm just going to recommend one of the ones I've watched so

525
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,920
 far it would be Esther McCallum Stewart on the history of the board game of board games and how

526
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,200
 it relates to Doctor Who that is not the title I thought that was a great talk I really enjoyed it

527
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:06,040
 and it also has lots of um slides of shoota get wa so you know that's good I enjoyed watching

528
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,240
 John Clutes Be a Saffay lecture which is about a subject I knew nothing about namely the fact

529
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:17,240
 that the British library has been discarding uh book jackets for many years and he had some

530
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,640
 really interesting examples of where the book jackets are very like historically important to

531
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,560
 the presentation and marketing of the book and that we wouldn't know any of this except that

532
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:32,280
 some people have saved the books with the book jackets so I recommend that I have been thinking

533
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:38,360
 about that talk ever since watching it because as in passing he said that the British library now

534
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:46,520
 accepts an electronic deposit as a deposit of a book and electronic books often do not have all

535
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,520
 the front matter that a book would have and I wonder if we are losing critical things by as a result

536
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:59,960
 of this policy but also I wonder whether electronic books should have all of the stuff that a paper

537
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:06,280
 book has as part of its front matter and back matter. Esther's talk was called Good Men Don't Need

538
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,880
 Rules, Game of Play and Doctor Who. I mean I'm probably going to slightly spoil this talk by saying

539
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:19,480
 her argument was that Good Men Bend the Rules and Bad Men and Villains Cheat. Yes I was going to

540
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,320
 recommend a panel I saw but unfortunately I don't think it was streamed so I'm going to recommend

541
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,880
 the same one that I've been recommending all along which is Strange Worlds Strange Games

542
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,960
 which was Stuart Haughtsons talk which I thought was very good you can see me wearing my Garth

543
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,000
 Meringue cosplay in the stream but it was very interesting and I think the other one if I was

544
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,600
 going to I'd tell you to watch the business meeting if you're interested in East Cons and

545
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,680
 you weren't there because there was stuff about the next East con which was also interesting.

546
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,800
 I thought the panel that John was on about mega constellations was really excellent and you should

547
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,640
 go watch that. I met Bill Ray he's very interesting hello Bill if you're listening.

548
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:03,080
 I met Bill Ray at Lisa Conrad's 60th birthday party and we had a conversation during which it

549
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,960
 became clear that he had run the games room for the East con I chaired in 1995 and I mean I did

550
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:15,160
 know that at the time but 1995 is a long time ago and I can tell you Bill looked very different in 1995

551
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,160
 and I did not recognize him and it took us some time to work this out and he did not recognize me

552
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,720
 either. On the subject of games I this East con I spent more in the dealers room than I have

553
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:33,320
 at many East con's because this East con did something very clever they had a stall that sold

554
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:41,480
 games and so I bought games and it was good. I feel like it was the it was the games company that

555
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,520
 did something very clever by taking stall at the East con but did East con reach out to them?

556
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:53,080
 I don't know I just think I remember at my first no sorry my second East con there was a game

557
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:59,240
 stall at Heathrow in 2008 and I remember buying a copy of a Star Wars RPG supplement from them

558
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,320
 and being very happy I'd found it and ever since then I've been surprised by how many

559
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,680
 science researchers and competitors don't have games stalls I am always confused by this because

560
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:13,320
 if you want to part me from my money I have games in the dealers room but they did and it was good

561
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,560
 I bought a copy of cyborg which I'm very much looking forward to playing and I also bought a

562
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:23,400
 copy of Lucky for None which came with a D13 which I'm very excited about. Chris Lowry who was

563
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,600
 representing Beyond Cataclysm games at East con and around that stall was very good value

564
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:35,320
 generally in that he was on a panel that I was on that had a and John was on that had an interesting

565
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,680
 it went through numerous changes before the event because Chris came along and said well this is a

566
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,320
 panel about James journalism and I'm a games journalist so maybe I should be on it and and

567
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,600
 it took a little time but we did actually manage to get him onto the panel yes in the end but also

568
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,720
 he played games with me I had to play a game every day I am playing a different game every day in

569
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:01,240
 2024 which is quite a strange way to behave but there you go and Chris helped me by playing

570
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,520
 coup with me at East con and me I was there too yeah but you're not trying to play a different

571
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,720
 game every day in 2024 which is the bad thing no but I still I still count as a person in your

572
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:21,960
 anecdotes Alison sometimes boo boo depends yeah so no he was good he was good fun to hang out with

573
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:27,880
 and good fun on and good value on panels and yeah yes I think that tabletop games panel was

574
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,240
 interesting but that's mostly because I like games if you like games you might also find

575
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,920
 interesting if you don't it's unlikely yes I'm quite blessed in that a couple of people have

576
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,200
 said that panels that I was on were interesting so that was quite nice we didn't have any reports

577
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:47,320
 of covid over the weekend and that is partly because the venue was extremely spacious that there

578
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,960
 was plenty of room for everyone it's also because we understand that the ventilation system doesn't

579
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,400
 recirculate any of the air the air comes in is used once and goes out again and and they believe

580
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:05,400
 that that reduces infection in the building Sandra Bond commented so it comes in once and then

581
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,040
 goes straight back out again you mean like Dave McCarty that is very good there are no reports

582
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,400
 of covid from the con I got a bit of a tickly cough but I tested like seven times and it was negative

583
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:21,000
 every time I had a pretty bad cough and two days of fatigue but I probably have had two days of

584
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,280
 fatigue anyway it felt it felt much more like traditional conchre than it did anything else

585
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,080
 there was no covid might be because of the good ventilation might be because of lower rates

586
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:37,400
 impossible to tell but hurrah pretty much yeah okay let it's about embraces if you you don't know

587
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:43,560
 you need the base braces till the belt falls off yes something like that do we have anything

588
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,200
 else to say about Eastercon oh we did the newsletter we should say that you could go and read it on

589
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,960
 efansies probably we'll put a link up when it comes up which might not quite be by Thursday

590
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:06,920
 shall we move on to pics I have started but not finished watching the new Amazon Prime series

591
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:14,600
 Fallout which is based on a video game I have only played I think the first and maybe second

592
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:20,920
 fallout to any degree I really really like the first one when it was isometric but then it went

593
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,160
 first person and I get lost in first person games because they're like real life and I get lost in

594
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:30,280
 real life but in real life people don't keep shooting at you the thing about Fallout the video

595
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:39,400
 game series is it is a really set in a really strange retro future as if the world had got stuck

596
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:49,160
 in corny 1950s America and then everywhere got nuked and a bunch of people went and hit underground

597
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:54,600
 for 200 years and now they are one of them is coming out and having a look at society

598
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:02,360
 what's been left on the surface and the tv series captures all of that pretty well I think so it

599
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:12,520
 doesn't feel realistic in maybe the way that the last of us did it's clearly quite arch all of

600
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:18,680
 the time and that's quite unsettling in a television series in a way that less so in a game and I am

601
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,240
 enjoying it a whole lot I like I like being the first person to watch something for a while it is

602
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:28,120
 on Amazon Prime so and Amazon Prime is now annoying in Britain because they have started putting little

603
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:35,400
 ads in everywhere and that's pissy and I might have to spend £2.99 a month to get rid of the ads but

604
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:41,480
 that kind of is very annoying so I don't want to. Well I have not watched it yet it is on the list

605
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:48,200
 you span your love to Fallout games I don't like them very much but I'm hoping I'll like the tv show

606
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,280
 I've played a bunch of Fallout 3 quite enjoying it and what's tv show yet?

607
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:59,080
 I think we had Fallout 4. Yeah so my pick is that I haven't read as much because they released a new

608
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:03,320
 patch for Stardew Valley and then I realized I hadn't played the whole patch and I can now get

609
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,960
 out of my switch which the controls are a lot better than they are on the Android phone and so I

610
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,240
 have been farming it's very nice it's very relaxing apart from when you're in the mind if anyone's

611
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:20,680
 not played Stardew Valley it is a farming simulator sort of it's farming simulator and you're in a

612
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,920
 village and you go and make friends with all the villagers in my case by giving them a present

613
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:32,680
 of jam every time I see them and you're just kind of collecting more and more you know materials

614
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:38,840
 and metals and vegetables and farming cows and so on so you can get more money to buy

615
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,320
 more vegetables and then you get a nicer house and yeah it's very addictive really

616
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:49,320
 and each day takes like 12 minutes or something to play so you can just think oh I'll just play

617
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:55,560
 through like one day of of farming sim and then it's three days later of real time obviously that

618
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:01,240
 makes sense that sounds good I have not played it in the same genre as Harvest Moon I believe

619
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:06,840
 yeah it's got the cute little eight bit e-bick graphics I bounced off this game quite hard but

620
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:12,120
 lots of people I know like it quite a lot I mean that might be good for you because I think you would

621
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:18,840
 play it a lot well I mean I I have tried and and I would love I love nothing more than to find a new

622
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:24,760
 game that I fall into and and play obsessively for a while but the outcomes aren't sharp enough

623
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,760
 for me it's it's too you've got a whole set of options that you could do every day and they're

624
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:37,320
 all a bit fluffy is that because they're a sheep in it I am going to pick a game I'm going to pick

625
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:44,120
 Thunder Road Vendetta and very dramatic it is it's basically Mad Max Fury Road for a board game

626
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:50,280
 except without the character based drama and with helicopters so basically this is a race game in

627
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:57,240
 which you are racing along a big desert and there's a road and you've got three cars each and you

628
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,680
 roll some dice and you have to put dice on the cars and the dice you put on the car tells you

629
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:05,960
 how to cast the car goes and you can slam other cars and shoot other cars and etc and it was good

630
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:12,680
 I played it with three friends it was quite quick it was quite strategic and it was just a fun little

631
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:18,680
 dice game that oozes theme and I thought yeah I was quite good after we played it and then my

632
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,600
 friend showed me the expansion and some of the characters in the expansion and I was like oh I

633
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:29,240
 wanted to play as those characters now please so I am excited to play again which I think is a good

634
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,520
 sign not sure if I need it in my collection but it's sort of thing I'm quite happy to play with

635
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:41,080
 pals and that was the old to-thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

636
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,080
 and it's goodbye from me

637
00:57:43,080 --> 00:58:05,400
 so you're young people right?

638
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:10,440
 vaguely to use send people long incoherent voicemails instead of text messages

639
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,800
 no but people send me voicemails instead of messages because my daughter did this for the first time

640
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,720
 last week and I was like oh no this is not an improvement this is a thing that young people do

641
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:25,400
 I think I actually quite like it because if because I listen to podcasts it's just like getting a

642
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,360
 podcast from your daughter I mean not your daughter but you know people yeah like when my friend

643
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:35,000
 Bella sends me like loads of voicemails I just put them on what's happened just like you know

644
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,320
 did the ironing or something it's nice I will do it occasionally but if you send me one at a time

645
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,160
 when it's not convenient listen to voicemail message I will send your grumpy text message back

646
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:48,120
 saying please put message in text not listening um I can see they're useful notes if you're going

647
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:53,400
 to type a really long message yeah fair enough in this case she was telling me a delicious anecdote

648
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:59,880
 and it was much better as an anecdote such as you might you might tell someone the theme music for
