1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,220
 Liz, do you fancy a quick game of our comp

2
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,220
 horror before Alison's ready to?

3
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,620
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and we are coming to you two weeks after Easter at

4
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,540
 which we had our first live show which had many comments in the chat as some of our

5
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,580
 favorite podcast posts say. How did you feel that the live recording went?

6
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:52,620
 I thought it was full of drivel and distractions and people not really keeping on topic and

7
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,780
 it went on far too long and then when I listened to the editor it sounded more or less alright

8
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,980
 so I think that's what we're aiming for right?

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,540
 Yeah and Liz was good.

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,780
 Yeah I think we've peaked and it's just going to be downhill from now on but maybe we can

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,340
 hope for a very slow decline over some time.

12
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,500
 So EasterCon had a variety of virtual components this year owing to gestures out of window.

13
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,580
 How did we think the Zoom bit session?

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,620
 I think they put a load of work into it. I think Keith Smith and his team essentially

15
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,060
 stepped up to the plate and worked out how they would do it and make it work well and

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,060
 it did work well.

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,380
 It seemed to run very smoothly. I think it was obviously a very different sort of experience

18
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,140
 for the people presenting especially poor Phil who's being sick with the plague and

19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,420
 sort of came off his deathbed in order to do his presentation for 2022 but I think the

20
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,140
 actual mechanical running of it in many ways worked better than our regular bid session

21
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,980
 which I think is something that parliaments around the world are finding as well that it

22
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,700
 turns out that when you stop people cat calling and interrupting and generally acting like

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,020
 lunes you get a better democratic outcome.

24
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,660
 I think in some cases it was quite hard to do the questions by text because if you're

25
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,260
 doing them live in the room people can get a lot of context from you and the way you say

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,140
 it and I think there were some questions that maybe got misunderstood or we did not get

27
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,660
 quite the answer that the the questioner was looking for but other than that it was pretty

28
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,460
 good. It was a good start. It meant I could go to the bid session which otherwise I would

29
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,620
 not have been doing so that was quite nice.

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,580
 Did you vote for An Easter Kong?

31
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,100
 I did vote for An Easter Kong. Yeah I mean essentially it's back to Birmingham again.

32
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,260
 I don't mind Birmingham Hilton. It's a perfectly reasonable place for An Easter Kong. We didn't

33
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,380
 go this year so let's go next year.

34
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,860
 For those who don't know the 2021 Easter Kong will be confusion in 2021. It will be held

35
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,060
 at the Birmingham Hilton Metropolitan. The guests have won as far as we remember were

36
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,260
 Don Appnite, Nick Vincent and Dave Lally but the list is not on the website yet so we

37
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,660
 apologize sincerely if we have forgotten one.

38
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,580
 I am excited about confusion but one thing I do want to touch on is that my understanding

39
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,220
 is that the Birmingham Hilton Metropolitan Metropolitan was chosen as the location before

40
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,100
 the COVID-19 situation arose. It's interesting that this I think was the first time we would

41
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,540
 have gone back to a hotel in back-to-back years for a long time. I know I think it's

42
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,340
 happened in the Dimondistant past but what do you think about having Easter Kong in the

43
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,860
 same place two years in a row?

44
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,260
 I think it's becoming increasingly difficult to find hotels. The other thing that was announced

45
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:48,380
 at Easter was that Phil Dyson is kind of a bid presumptive for 2022 but didn't want

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:57,460
 to bid because he hasn't nailed a hotel down yet and I think some of the sites that we

47
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,340
 might have used in the past are not acceptable to us now. Some of them are out of our price

48
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,060
 range now. The Easter Kong becomes more demanding in what it needs every year.

49
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,260
 But Easter Kong is kind of stable in size. You have to actually work to prevent it from

50
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,140
 growing but it's around about a thousand which is quite a difficult size to put into

51
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:23,980
 hotels in the UK. They just aren't that many sites and I think Liz said, 'Oh, the Hilton

52
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,580
 Birmingham Metropolitan Metropolitan Metropolitan', 'is a perfectly good site'. In fact, it was

53
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,420
 quite a lot better than that last time we went. It really did have, apart from being on

54
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,180
 a motorway junction, pretty well everything you would want an Easter Kong site to have,

55
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:45,860
 like local shops and restaurants and beer and good cheap food and plenty of function

56
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,140
 space and plenty of bedrooms to the extent that they don't have to use an overflow. Everyone

57
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:56,100
 always gets into the hotel and I think that's quite compelling. I can see that having negotiated

58
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,860
 it once, I can see that Vanessa would want to go back. The other thing I wanted to say

59
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:06,500
 about Confusion 2021 is that the other thing I want to talk about Confusion 2021 is that

60
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,420
 although Vanessa is chairing again, it's otherwise a different committee. I think a couple of

61
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,540
 the same people working on the convention but the overall committee has new people on

62
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,740
 it and in particular I don't think it's got its program head in place yet. It's a different

63
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,820
 committee to the committee that would go to give us the East Kong this year.

64
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,740
 Yeah, you're right. I'm probably a little bit unfair to the Hilton. It was noticeably

65
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,260
 better last time we went than the time before because a lot more shops and restaurants and

66
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,140
 everything have grown up around that development. So it's less kind of in the middle of nowhere

67
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,180
 and there's nowhere else to go and eat and more in the middle of other things and I think

68
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,340
 that made the hotel more competitive about feeding us because we actually have other

69
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,300
 options. They're not the only game in town. It also has extremely good transportation

70
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,140
 links as well. Yes, it does and I think one of the things I remember about the first time

71
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,460
 we went was that the food situation was not really very good and the most recent time

72
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,460
 we went it was a lot better. So I agree with you that the growth of the complex nearby

73
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,140
 it's called a Nando's and a pizza express another chain restaurant. So it's nothing

74
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,620
 particularly to write home about but it just gives you a lot more option than you had before.

75
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,260
 It also has one of the best restaurants in the Midlands. So it actually as well as having

76
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,420
 its cheap restaurants it's also got a couple of really high-end restaurants. So it was

77
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,740
 filling that niche for people who wanted to go do a bit of fine dining as well. Excellent

78
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,660
 and it does have very very good function space. In fact it's got more function space than

79
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,700
 a Easter con can use which is unusual for a hotel. The other thing that had changed in

80
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,020
 between our two more recent visits is that they'd had the furries I think a couple of

81
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,820
 times and I think the furries are more or less exactly like the Easter con except with

82
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,100
 more fur. And so they really knew how to serve a crowd that was like that.

83
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,980
 Yeah I think as hotels get used to conventions they get more and more keen to have conventions

84
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:10,180
 because I think conventions are usually relatively well behaved group of people who will spend

85
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,380
 in orders amounts of food and drink while being very polite and quiet. I think that

86
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,820
 was clear in the difference between the Hilton the two times we went. And I think it stands

87
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,140
 as stark contrast to the Radisson Ed Wardian which was one of the common East con hotels

88
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,340
 of yesterday because they got progressively worse and always treated the convention attendees

89
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,980
 as a lower class of hotel guests than the non-convention attendees which I think left

90
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,820
 a very poor taste in the mouth and led to an awful lot of dissatisfaction with that as

91
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,260
 a venue. So I think that the Hilton Metropolitan does a much better job from that perspective

92
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,780
 too. I'm happy we're going back. I really like that hotel. I find it very easy to get

93
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,420
 to because it's a direct train from Southampton. There are lots of hotels around if you don't

94
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,180
 want to stay in the con hotel but there's plenty of room in the con hotel if you do.

95
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,460
 And it's generally a very good location. So I am excited to go in 2021.

96
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,860
 I just want to go to an Easter con anywhere anytime ever again. Oh sorry. Not Easter?

97
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,340
 I mean one of the things that surprised me about the bid session was there was a question

98
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,620
 about what would happen if COVID-19 meant that there were still travel restrictions

99
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,780
 in place at Easter next year. And the con con said that they hadn't really thought about

100
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,180
 that and hadn't put any plans in place. What do you think about that? Do you think that's

101
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:35,620
 sensible? I was appalled by how little planning they did this year. I mean obviously Cavendish

102
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:42,260
 Councilor Easter con is terrible but I feel that they could have done a lot more in the

103
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,220
 four weeks or five weeks between when they cancelled and the original dates to make sure

104
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,980
 that virtual events were happening and were encouraged even if they hadn't done all the

105
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,820
 work of organising them themselves. What they actually did was sent out a thing saying please

106
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,540
 don't organise any events because we're going to let you know which was the exact opposite

107
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,780
 of what I think they should have done. I understand that if it'd be my Easter con being cancelled

108
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,060
 I might have been too busy crying into my beer to think about what alternatives we could

109
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:22,900
 have but it would have been quite straightforward to have set up social spaces to have set a

110
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,380
 system in place so that panels could have happened. To say we're going to have some

111
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,660
 chats about some topics you might be interested in that you could sign up to be on a panel

112
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,260
 on or something like that and they could have done all of that and they didn't do any of

113
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,380
 it and that was for this year. So I was very keen to say Easter cons or all conventions

114
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,620
 in the future should have some planning arrangements for this sort of thing and should be planning

115
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,420
 to do virtual things so that they could switch if they need to and I was surprised that they

116
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:59,380
 didn't. I feel that they missed an opportunity. I feel that although as they said doing it

117
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,700
 properly can be quite expensive you can do it improperly with not a lot of work as we've all

118
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,540
 discovered in the last six weeks. I think I'm not surprised that they didn't do anything because

119
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:19,140
 I think that it was very clearly a big shock to everyone that this developed as quickly as it did

120
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,580
 like intellectually I knew it was going to but sort of emotionally I think it really hit me that like

121
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,380
 this is the first Easter for a very long time that I've not gotten to an Easter con so that was a bit

122
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:34,180
 of a shock to the system and so I think I can understand why they might not but they would

123
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,820
 arrange anything this time round and I appreciate that's very hard thing and I appreciate that

124
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,260
 that could have been very fought. What I am sort of hoping is that if there are still travel restrictions

125
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,500
 next year we don't end up in a situation where again we have no officially to come provision because

126
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:57,300
 I don't want to end up in a situation where this kind of thing happens again with no

127
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:04,660
 official panels or official social spaces or anything like that. I think I can understand

128
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,780
 and sympathize with what happened this year. I think if you are planning to do Easter con next

129
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:16,340
 year it is just prudent to assume that you are not going to know until close to time how it's

130
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,220
 going to work. I think it's just prudent to plan for if you have to do a remote Easter con or if you

131
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,980
 want to even include some remote options because clearly the last thing that's going to come back

132
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,900
 is large gatherings of people and the last thing that's going to come back is like long-distance

133
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,900
 travel. So you might be in the position where we can have a full Easter con. You might be in the

134
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,260
 position where you have a reduced Easter con or you might be in the position where you have no

135
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,260
 Easter con and I think it's at this point you just have to have contingency plans for those

136
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,860
 and if you don't then you're going to have another year of planning to run a great convention

137
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,180
 and then being extremely disappointed if you can't do that. I think there is a fourth option which is

138
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:02,260
 that they may have a lot of members who even if travel is allowed and the Easter con is allowed

139
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,940
 have decided for themselves that it's not safe to do so and I think the notion that we might

140
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:16,260
 disenfranchise our oldest and in poorest health members not because they can't physically get to

141
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,660
 the convention but that we don't think that they don't think it's safe for them to do so and that

142
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,580
 even with a year's warning nobody's doing anything about that and when they were asked the question

143
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,460
 we're kind of like well we've got no plans to do anything about that. I feel like there's a lot

144
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,420
 more that could be done here. I agree and I think it will be really interesting to see what does

145
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,860
 happen next year because obviously I think all three of us are very much hoping that Easter

146
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,100
 Cop will happen and everything will be normal and there will be none of this that needs to be worried

147
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,940
 about that I am keenly aware that me hoping that happens and it's actually happening are two very

148
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:57,700
 different things. I think the other interesting point here is that especially with WorldCom but

149
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:04,660
 with Easter con as well I think the idea of having panels one can access virtually from the

150
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,300
 perspective of being able to buy a supporting membership and do that is something that has been

151
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:16,580
 being talked about more and more in recent years and I am wondering whether this will be a shove

152
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,340
 towards trying to start making that happen and I am hoping that this is the shove that starts making

153
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,860
 that happen because I often find myself in situations at Easter con where I end up missing a panel

154
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,340
 that I would love to go back and see a recording of or I end up being on a panel where I would love

155
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,540
 to watch it back because I think there were some really interesting points made and I am not

156
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,900
 able to take notes as thoroughly as I would like to while talking so I think it would be really

157
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,100
 nice if we could develop that capability and this seems like a good almost like a good excuse to

158
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,860
 try and do that. Do you two think that this will be an impetus towards that? Do you think I am being

159
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,820
 overly optimistic? I think you are right I think that everyone would like more things to be streamed

160
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,780
 live broadcast recorded for later consumption and this could be got an opportunity because

161
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,740
 what the benefit here is that you could plan your convention panels so they can either happen

162
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,180
 live at the Easter con with a streaming broadcast or they can happen live from people's houses with

163
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:21,300
 a streaming broadcast and then in either situation you are already prepared. I think the best way to

164
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,300
 do this is to have some of the panels planned that way so rather than saying we're going to try

165
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:34,020
 and recreate the 420 items at an Easter con or whatever we've got a lot which includes all sorts

166
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,780
 of items which nobody in their right minds will put on the internet along with all sorts of things

167
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:46,580
 where actually the the audience for them is is very small. I think the latter sort are fine

168
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,460
 you know you may only get 10 people tuning in but those people really care and they're all over

169
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,820
 the world so I think there is something there about you could do certain sorts of things better

170
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,940
 in small groups including an internet presence and if you just said well we won't be doing all of

171
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,580
 it but we're going to focus on a cut say half a dozen really high profile events that we'll do

172
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:15,780
 online and a few small and very specialist events that you that will do online and the rest of the

173
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:22,260
 stuff will happen if it happens and not if it doesn't. I think that's very true and actually I spent

174
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,180
 two days this week doing two full day training calls which all took place on zoom and it was

175
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,700
 incredibly tiring and I would never voluntarily do that for an Easter con so you don't need to stream

176
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:40,420
 420 items you need to stream 20. Maximum yeah because I think if I was going to do that I would

177
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:48,340
 be streaming the big guest of honor panels and talks because oftentimes what happens is I'm torn

178
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:55,300
 between an interesting little niche item and the interview with John Scalzi and if you stream the

179
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,700
 interview with John Scalzi John Scalzi is already going to be on his best behavior because he is in

180
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,500
 that kind of work mode as a guest of honor anyway and it means I can go to a small little niche panel

181
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,860
 that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to attend so I do think there is an argument there that you

182
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,420
 can get around that by only streaming the big panels where you're already hedging your bets a bit.

183
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,940
 The other thing I will say is that I think that at the moment we have panels that are more intimate

184
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,980
 because we know they're not being recorded and I think if you start recording panels you will get

185
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,300
 a slight shift in what people are willing to say if they know they're being recorded which I think

186
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,340
 would change the complexion of the panel slightly. It is interesting to note I think I saw one of the

187
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,380
 people who worked on Conzieland saying that prior to the announcement they were going virtual

188
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,340
 only five people who had filled out the program survey could set that they did not want to be

189
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,140
 recorded so I think most people appearing on panels are willing to be recorded I think as long

190
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,700
 as they know it's going to happen in advance and can tailor their presence on that panel

191
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,900
 with that knowledge. I do think in some ways you'd lose a lot if you streamed the entire program but I

192
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:04,980
 wouldn't necessarily think that would be necessary although I will say if it was only available to

193
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,580
 supporting and attending members I think I wonder to what extent I would be worried about guarding

194
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:16,020
 my speech because if I know that anyone of the Eastcon can watch my speech back that's not much

195
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,580
 more public than anyone of the Eastcon being able to come into my panel but I don't know.

196
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:27,300
 Anybody at the Eastcon who has recorded technology can then pass it on. In practice everyone can

197
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,940
 record all the time anyway you know we've we've not really people are very polite about asking if

198
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:41,380
 they can record panels but anyone with a phone can record a panel so we don't really we've not

199
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,980
 really been able to have the sort of freedom to have the late night drunken panels that we that

200
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,540
 were once a feature of conventions that's not necessarily a bad thing but I do miss them sometimes.

201
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:58,020
 Well you do still get a couple but I must admit I always prefer going to parties than panels but

202
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:04,660
 I want to have a drunken laugh. So the last time we were at the Birmingham Hilton I went to a late

203
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:11,060
 night panel on I think administering the Hugo Awards which sounded like an incredibly dry panel but

204
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:17,700
 was actually a really great one so sometimes the unexpected panels are the surprisingly great

205
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,940
 slightly all the audience are drinking late night panels. That's a good point and certain

206
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,220
 panel concepts like vote with your ass would work very well as a drunken late night thing

207
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,220
 although you'd have to be quite careful not for it to become a contact sport I think.

208
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:41,540
 You may have to explain vote with your ass John. You have a room in which there is either

209
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:48,020
 sort of a one-dimensional line or a circle of chairs and the moderator of the panel will pose

210
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,060
 questions to the audience and the audience will divide themselves in the room according to their

211
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:59,940
 opinion on that question so oftentimes it'll be like which is better the 10th or 11th doctor

212
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,540
 and everyone who thinks the 10th doctor is best stands on the left and then everyone who thinks

213
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,580
 the 11th doctor is best stands on the right. Where do you put the people who can't remember

214
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:14,500
 which is which? It's a good panel item for a light-hearted kind of group argument format

215
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,100
 which can be very fun especially if everyone has had a drink so as a late night panel idea it could

216
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,220
 work quite well. The people who think the fourth doctor was best just rattles Emma frames.

217
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:32,580
 Another bid that was mooted at the bid session was the 2022 bid led by Phil Dyson who has

218
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:39,780
 Covid-19 at the point he was presenting the bid which is truly heroic. He still did a pretty good job

219
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:46,180
 I have to say. He did an excellent job. I think for somebody who was plague ridden he really did

220
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,780
 step up to the plate and give a good bid. I think he probably did better than I would do remotely

221
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,900
 without the plague so. Smash it out of the park. I've got a lot of time for Phil. I think he's an

222
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,900
 excellent com runner and I think his bid was very well put together. There was a kind of

223
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,580
 take the temperature of the room vote for whether a lot of people thought what he had announced was

224
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,940
 fair but he did not put his bid forward for a natural confirmation vote because they do not

225
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,020
 yet have a venue. They are still in discussion with a few different places as to where they're

226
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:24,580
 going to end up. I think they heavily hinted that they were trying to end up in the north of England

227
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:30,740
 somewhere. Are you excited about the 2022 East College and what you heard at the bid session?

228
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,940
 It's actually much easier to bid at East Decon if you're not doing the whole package.

229
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,500
 So if you don't have your whole committee together, if you don't have a site to announce,

230
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,700
 if you don't have anything for people to really say, well, actually we hate some of this idea.

231
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,260
 So obviously it was, it's very positive but that's because it's not a complete bid yet.

232
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,340
 I'm still very excited about the idea of going to an Eastergatan and meeting my friends. You have

233
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,300
 no idea. I'm very excited about the idea of going to the pub. I'm actually quite excited about

234
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,460
 the idea of going to the shops, you know, not to buy essential items but just to kind of

235
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:13,540
 hang around an apple store for an afternoon. You know, I might like... What excites me as

236
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:20,660
 really gone downhill at this point? You heard it here first folks. And to like stop at those

237
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:25,620
 pretzel stands where they give you a bit of pretzel to taste with germs no doubt.

238
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:33,140
 All of these things, I'm just very excited by anything else that's sitting in rooms.

239
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,140
 There's how excited are you by bits of pretzel and going to apple stores?

240
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:45,220
 There's a knot to things which are really high on my list to be honest. I'm quite excited by the

241
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,660
 idea of having an Eastergatan in 2022. I think Phil's going to do a great job and I look forward

242
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,580
 to seeing the rest of Phil's team and his guests and also location. I think it's also worth noting that

243
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:04,100
 we really don't know what the hotel market is going to look like in 2022 and what will be available

244
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,340
 and it might completely have changed. There might be far fewer in-person gatherings and

245
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:16,420
 prices could change and hotel chains could completely evolve. So it's going to be a fun year for Phil

246
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:22,500
 sorting that one out. I think we may have a significantly smaller Eastergatan or a significantly

247
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:30,580
 bigger one. I think one of the things we do know is that it takes a lot for hotels to actually close.

248
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:37,860
 They just they kind of go down market and shabbier and shabbier and shabbier when times are hard

249
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:46,180
 until they end up as the Adelphi and it seems likely that when we do decide we want to get together

250
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:52,100
 again we will find somewhere we can do that. I think going a bit down market and shabbies really

251
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:59,380
 are on target set of hotels. Okay so one of the reasons that Eastercons are hard at the moment

252
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:06,180
 is that shabby hotels tend to be quite bad for access and we have increasingly complex access

253
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:12,980
 needs. That's I think a big part of the problem. I mean the Adelphi, I still love it but it is a

254
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,940
 nightmare of stairs as well as being a nightmare of a hotel to work with. We had a stair problem at

255
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,780
 the Majestic that I think that they've looked at again for 2022 and concluded is not ever going

256
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,900
 to be soluble. I think that's a problem with a lot of the shabby sites that if you're shabby you

257
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,900
 don't sort out these access problems and although we talk about fans liking slightly shabby spaces

258
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,900
 as we've grown older we've kind of liked our creature comforts as well. So in fact we don't

259
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:46,020
 really like shabby hotels any more than anybody else does. So what we're actually hoping for is

260
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:52,900
 hotels with great access to become shabby. I think it will be interesting to see if some of the high

261
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:59,380
 end conferences do go virtual whether there is scope to use the sorts of hotels that are just

262
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,780
 completely out of our league at the moment that do exist. Yeah that's fair it will be interesting

263
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:10,660
 to see how that happens I think. Over the weekend there were a plethora, a myriad, a very civil

264
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,660
 smorgasbord of virtual activities arranged by a host of good people including our very own

265
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:23,460
 Alison Scott. So what virtual pursuits did you go to? I think we mentioned a lot of them on the

266
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:31,700
 podcast but what did you go to and what worked and what didn't. I didn't go to any of the program

267
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,060
 but I did go to a party every single night so it was a lot like a release to come for me.

268
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,180
 I did go to the bidding session but apart from that I didn't get to any program. I don't think

269
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:46,660
 there was any program actually I think that that's the problem and I discovered that drinking a very

270
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:52,420
 large amount of beer in the vicinity of my extremely expensive work computer is probably a terrible

271
00:24:52,420 --> 00:25:00,100
 mistake and I may need to some kind of beer ingestion system that doesn't involve leaving it

272
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,900
 leaving open cans of beer on my desk in future. You need one of those hats with the two cans of

273
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,660
 beers in the store. For example I'm not sure how that would go with the whole headphones and

274
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:17,940
 microphone and pop filter. Now this is a new market headphones with built-in beer holders.

275
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,980
 Yes we have invented a thing well we have the idea for an invention we will we will

276
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:30,020
 patent it and octa thought what we forever remembered as the inventor of the podcaster beer

277
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,300
 romantic 3000. I also went to parties I don't think I went to as many parties as you.

278
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,980
 Did you go to the dead dog? I didn't find out about the dead dog until afterwards.

279
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,660
 I did go to the dead dog because I did find out about it but one of the things I established when I

280
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:50,660
 set my party up was that you have to be quite assiduous in telling people that events are on

281
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,660
 in Facebook. I got to the point where I was worried that Facebook were going to cussend the police

282
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,900
 round because every time I went into my Facebook event for my party it flashed up increasingly

283
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,980
 strident warnings saying you're not supposed to be gathering you should not be having events of

284
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,260
 many people and there didn't seem to be a box to tick to say it's on zoom you idiots.

285
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:18,340
 I kind of publicised my party very hard much more than I ever would a real party where essentially

286
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:23,460
 you have to be chatting to me and then I give you party invitation but I kind of told everyone

287
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,700
 repeatedly about it and including people who were not on on Facebook and I think other people who

288
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:38,020
 ran parties rather relied on Facebook to show the party invite to their friends and Facebook's

289
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:44,740
 terrible at that so I think a lot of people didn't know about it but there were parties every night

290
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:51,780
 I think and some nights have more than one party. Yes I thoroughly enjoyed your room party or

291
00:26:51,780 --> 00:27:00,340
 sorry your zoom party. I started the party at night I had some beer that I had bought from the pub

292
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,460
 across the bridge from me which I believe I was talking about at the live recording and then

293
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,540
 I had some beer and then I had some more beer and then I had some gin and then I had some more gin

294
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,660
 and a midnight oiled with pizza and a some pizza and I went to bed at 3am and then I woke up the

295
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:23,300
 next morning with a stonking hangover and no hotel breakfast so it was almost exactly like a real

296
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,540
 Saturday night at least con and I thoroughly enjoyed it it really took all of the sadness out

297
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:35,060
 of my weekend it was absolutely fantastic so thank you very much for organising it it was great that's

298
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,980
 very kind I that was what I was hoping for I was hoping that people would drink too much and stay

299
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,420
 up too late and have hangovers there is a slight problem with zoom parties which is it turns out

300
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:54,340
 that if you drink too much and stay up too late then gradually people from Australia and New Zealand

301
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:00,820
 and indeed Thailand start to join your party and and these parties could theoretically just kind

302
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:07,140
 of continue on in a never-ending cycle of debauchery through this method though I think eventually

303
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,180
 zoom throws you out going you lotter a load of dirty stopouts ain't you got homes to go to

304
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,820
 but then you could just start start the zoom again so it's not too bad so basically you're saying

305
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:22,580
 that zoom is going to recreate was it the longest party anyone ever had that flies around in the

306
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,740
 hittakers guide yes randomly attacking places for party supplies you're basically going to recreate

307
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:35,140
 that I had a great time I was reminded of I think it was a few years ago John when you decided to

308
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,020
 stay up all night drinking at an Easter con and then we had breakfast together the next morning

309
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:46,420
 while you were extremely kind of passing from very drunk into slightly hungover and the hangover

310
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,940
 was going to appear and I was like just woken up and having breakfast and I very I definitely

311
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:57,140
 recreated that experience at Alison's party but it was fun because if it was a party actually at

312
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:04,100
 an Easter con then I would not have been able to go was that that must be 2008 maybe no is it the

313
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:12,500
 park in so it must be oh okay no I do remember uh well we we had breakfast with Shordon Maguire

314
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:19,780
 who was the guest of order because she turned up in the bar and me and Alison and Claire and Jerry

315
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,740
 and a couple of other people who I don't remember had been staying up drinking at about 6 a.m.

316
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:29,300
 Shordon came down and asked please tell me that you have gone up early and you're not here

317
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,460
 from the night before we said we got up early she said that's a lie isn't it we said yes

318
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,580
 and then she saw it and we eventually had breakfast but that might not have been the same type

319
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,780
 the problem with all of these stories is I was very drunk so my memories are hazy

320
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:51,300
 the park in is a remarkable hotel because it's at Heathrow it is possible to get caffeinated beverages

321
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:59,060
 made with actual coffee machines 24 hours a day without any difficulty at all so at that point

322
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:04,580
 at about three in the morning where you go you know unless I have a double espresso I'm probably

323
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:10,340
 going to need to go to bed soon you can have a double espresso and carry on it is pretty fantastic

324
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,940
 was that the one you were thinking of it or was it a different one I think it was that one but I

325
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:20,100
 think what happened is you had like three or four different separate breakfasts I think you had

326
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,940
 that breakfast I like 6 a.m. I think then you went for a nap and then you got to have breakfast again

327
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:32,100
 about 10 o'clock I mean I'm not saying I'm a hero but I'm heavily implying it I remember that

328
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,660
 it is possibly the most fun I have ever had at Eastcott every time I've got to the stage in my life

329
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,220
 that I every time I stay up all night drinking I think is this the last time I will ever stay

330
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:49,460
 up all night drinking and it never is or it never has been so far way well that's that is a result

331
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,740
 I think it and it was good because later on we were talking about it and you were right at about

332
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:02,100
 2 a.m. UK time and by that time I was half a pizza and many beers down and it was very good to see you

333
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:08,900
 I very hazel you remember that that happened and yes but it was it was it was properly it did

334
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:15,220
 properly feel like at Eastcott it it was it was truly excellent in other news things that have

335
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,460
 happened since last time we recorded one of us needs congratulating congratulations to Alison

336
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:31,940
 Scott for being this year's Guff winner yes I'm very pleased and I am quite pleased that it wasn't

337
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:37,460
 close that there that lots of people voted and lots of the voter for me and I do appreciate that

338
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:44,100
 that is that is lovely I'd been a bit worried because I I ran because one of my nominators kind

339
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,340
 of twisted my arm up the back and said you should really run in this race and that was

340
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,260
 because I was worried that there wouldn't be candidates or and then they ended up being

341
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:00,500
 sick so I was like and then there's a whole lot of complexity around this because given my

342
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,220
 this is the first guff race since my youngest child turned 18 and given my

343
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:13,620
 drothers I wouldn't have chosen to go to a worldcon in Australia and New Zealand I've chosen to go to a

344
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:20,900
 national convention because worldcons are kind of more the same anywhere whereas if you go to a

345
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:27,300
 national convention or a large regional you really get to meet fans in the area doing doing

346
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:33,140
 fanish things but because of various personal crap that's going on in my life I wasn't sure I

347
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:38,980
 would be able to run in a couple of years or three years or whatever so I am now committed to virtually

348
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,540
 attending CODZYLEN which I'm very much looking forward to and I'm going to talk a little bit

349
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,660
 about how I'm going to do that in a second but also I will make a real trip to Australia and

350
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:56,500
 New Zealand hopefully next year I mean I'm not going to go until it feels like it's safe to go

351
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:02,020
 so that might end up being I mean I hope it'll be next year but it might be 2022 you know but

352
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:07,860
 I'll go when I can and I'm I'm really excited to have won and thank you everyone very much for

353
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:13,940
 for voting for me and putting your faith in me as a fan fan delegate and it's particularly

354
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,900
 sweet because I really don't think I was ever going to be able to afford to travel to without

355
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,260
 the fanfums so I'm really very thrilled I am planning a virtual trip so what I'm going to do

356
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,620
 is I was going to go for three weeks ending two weeks in Australia and a week in New Zealand plus

357
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,820
 travel ending at the New Zealand Worldcon so I'd have had the Worldcon and then one rest day and

358
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,140
 then flying home and so I'm going to take that exact period of time and if you are any part of

359
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:47,940
 any Australian or New Zealand or somewhere who can reasonably visit it on the way as a stopover

360
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:55,300
 fan group I would like to have a virtual meeting in your area and I'd also like to do

361
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:02,420
 the virtual tourist attractions in in those areas in the period leading up to conceal and so I'm

362
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,460
 hoping to meet with as many fan groups as possible and as many fans as possible and do as many of

363
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:13,620
 the experiences virtually that I would actually have been able to do if I'd visit it so that's

364
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:19,140
 that's kind of the plan. Excellent stuff. I'm going to go on to Australia and New Zealand time one of

365
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:24,500
 those I I assume they are not all in the same time zone as it's an area about as big as Europe

366
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,860
 or maybe even a bit bigger so I don't know but I will I will do I will be on their time zones as

367
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:37,300
 well for three weeks which is kind of night shift. According to timeanddates.com there are eight

368
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:43,140
 total time zones in Australia and New Zealand and it's one of them a half hour time zone.

369
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:50,420
 Yes there's a half hour time zone. Yes Adelaide. So you can you can really go go off-piste and

370
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:56,740
 set yourself you know 10 and a half hours away. There's a quarter hour time zone. There's a

371
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:02,500
 quarter hour time zone Alison you must go there. On my tough trip I went to St John's in New

372
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,300
 Foundland on my way to Toronto and that is a half hour time zone and I'm like very excited because

373
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,020
 that's a cool thing to do. Mm-hmm. N.B. may not actually be cool maybe heavily dependent on

374
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,580
 Nurtory but yes there is a part of Australia which is a quarter hour time zone and I don't know if

375
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:23,060
 there is any fandom there but so there are eight time zones in Australia and New Zealand and my

376
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:28,820
 challenge for my virtual trip is to visit all of them. I will have the worst case of jet lag.

377
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:34,180
 I think I'll go to game for the worst case of jet lag ever without leaving your own home.

378
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:40,180
 Excellent. I'm not sure there are eight time zones I think they span eight hours technically.

379
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:47,220
 Ah maybe. But we might be too fine to time zone Nurtory now. Australians and New Zealanders please

380
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,740
 send us letters of comment about why we are wrong about your time zones. So we said those two

381
00:35:52,740 --> 00:36:00,420
 Alice and Dot's got no. I confidently predict that somewhere in a very small

382
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:06,420
 listenership there will be someone who is nerdy at the about time zones then we can believe possible

383
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:13,140
 and they will be in touch. Excellent. Please. For people who have not looked at the voting statistics

384
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,900
 there were six candidates for Guff one of the candidates dropped out and the other five were

385
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,980
 comprised of individuals and couples so it's like six groups of people I suppose rather than six

386
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,340
 individuals but Alice in one with over 50% of the first preference votes and when will you

387
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,300
 write your trip report Alison? Well I'm going to write a virtual trip report this year but I'll

388
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,020
 do a real one as well. You're not going to get my trip report for a while are you? I'll have to think

389
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:44,820
 of a more of another new format to do it in. Maybe it'll be the first zoom zoom. No it'll be the

390
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:52,980
 second zoom trip before I did. Me and Anna Raftree have been doing zoom videos in order to do Anna's

391
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,460
 TAF report so Anna went to Mid-American 2 in 2016 which was in Kansas City and she was the TAF

392
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:05,620
 winner and so I interviewed Anna on Friday as we record that was two days ago talking about the

393
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:11,540
 first leg of her trip and her reasons for running for TAF and how she found the experience of running

394
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:17,620
 I think that went really well. We had about 20 listeners live and the video audio and transcript

395
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,900
 thereof will be made available for a small donation to the fan funds when we've done

396
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:29,620
 the whole trip in conversational form. I wanted to explore what the format of a trip report could be

397
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:34,580
 because obviously the original trip reports came out of Van Zeen Van Dung in the early to mid-50s

398
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:40,340
 as the fan funds have gone on for longer and longer they have become less and less tied

399
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:45,460
 specifically to fanzing fandom and have become a much broader thing that reflects a lot more corners

400
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,100
 of our fandom which I think is really good but one of the flip sides of that is that not everyone

401
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:59,620
 who wins necessarily has the skills to write edit and produce a 80 to 100 page document

402
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:04,100
 so I think some people are you know much more conversational or have different skill sets

403
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:09,860
 and so I wanted to do something with Anna because I thought she would be very good in a kind of

404
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:14,980
 more conversational video audio medium and I think it went really well I hope it went really well

405
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,460
 I found it interesting but I was obviously interviewer and Liz could not attend because we held it in

406
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:24,900
 the evening which was about three in the morning for Liz but Alison very hopefully let us host it on

407
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,500
 her zoom and sort of did introductions and then we had a bit of a party afterwards so that was also

408
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:38,420
 very I think I am learning that when you're doing something like this formerly using zoom or another

409
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:44,740
 video conferencing solution it's extremely helpful to have one person whose job is only

410
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:50,580
 managing people in the room and letting them know what's going on and telling them how to do

411
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:57,380
 things and and all of that stuff because if you're trying to do that plus also run the interview

412
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,300
 if you're me you'll get distracted all of the time and because I don't have webinar mode because

413
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:07,220
 it's an extra 40 quid a month I'm we're doing this thing where whenever anyone turns up we have to

414
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:12,980
 we have to quickly turn their video off so that it doesn't appear on the eventual recording but

415
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:19,300
 hopefully that will all come out in John's beautiful edit um I think your fine video editing is much

416
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:26,100
 more complicated than podcast editing maybe the videos I think will probably be less highly

417
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,860
 edited than the audio so my my plan with the videos is basically just to cut out moments where

418
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:37,220
 it was someone else's camera coming up because they were joined and we hadn't managed to blank

419
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:42,500
 them out yet with the audio I will go through and kind of cut out the ums and errs and that will be

420
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:48,500
 available as a kind of audio book and then I will do transcripts of that on top um which Claire

421
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:55,700
 Breiley is assisting with in her capacity as person who does lots of work for very little thanks

422
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,020
 which is a thing that she is very good at and I try and make sure that I say her name and give

423
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:08,180
 her thanks wherever possible in order to address that balance I think it is good for uh the fan

424
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:13,540
 funds to move with the times a bit I think it is good not to exclude them from being fan fund

425
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,980
 candidates if their attitude is not for producing a giant rich and report but for doing something

426
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:24,900
 in audio form or video form or photography or whatever medium they would like to report it

427
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,340
 basically and I think you've got everything covered you're going to do it by video and audio and

428
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,980
 unfortunately not everyone will be able to watch live but there will be recordings and there will

429
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,780
 be transcripts so you've got all the bases covered yeah we are I think also going to try to do it

430
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,700
 different times to make sure that different recordings can have people from different time zones but

431
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,420
 I think I suspect most of them will be at times that US people can turn up because obviously

432
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:58,020
 TAF is most interesting to Europeans and people in North America and so obviously tailoring the

433
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:05,700
 time zones to the evening in Europe means that you hit that better but I think we'll try to at least

434
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:13,780
 one that is suitable for people who are in times zones ahead of London in order to make sure that

435
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,820
 they can have at least one experience of coming along just for you Liz and also for other people

436
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:26,180
 who live in far off places yeah I realize I have brought this upon myself by moving to a time zone

437
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,740
 which is either six or seven hours ahead of the UK but yeah you're not the first people to have to

438
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,620
 grapple with the problems of time zones virtual events and you will not be the last we will not

439
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:41,860
 and I suspect we will come on to discussing that a bit more when we touch upon Conzeland in the

440
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:47,460
 next episode do either of you have anything else you'd like to say about the fan funds I think this

441
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,980
 is probably a good point for you to mention your trip report your imminent trip report John so

442
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:59,540
 I have written a trip report it is 90 pages long and somewhere in the region of 25 000 words

443
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:06,180
 and it is very almost finished it only needs two more pieces of art and one of them is being

444
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:13,140
 constructed by a Alison Scott of Wartham stone so if Alison if you could sort of get your finger

445
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,820
 out a little bit and I can get my trigger while okay so there's a slight catch which is that

446
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,380
 this weekend a lot of the time that I might have done that has been doing things like

447
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:32,260
 helping with that as TAF thing and recording octa thought and in fact I've had I've had four

448
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:39,540
 kind of very work like zoom events where I've been responsible for managing the

449
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,780
 structure of the event this weekend which seems like more than you should have to have in

450
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:53,540
 I feel like I've discovered a new skill that's apparently a paying job skill in this new world

451
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,940
 except that I don't really want to do it for pay because I was very happy selling crap on the

452
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:04,580
 internet so you know anyway so yes so I'm sorry I will get my finger out but possibly still not

453
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,940
 this weekend so you know soon soon soon soon real soon now um as you've missed the east

454
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,740
 content line you don't really need to get a chat before comes elan do you?

455
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:18,740
 My new plan is probably to do it next year because next year will be the 10th anniversary and

456
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,860
 that seems like if I'm going to do it late I might as well do it properly late um but Anna

457
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:30,500
 does report so for those who don't know who aren't as red up on the various TAN funds as I am having

458
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:37,780
 been an administrator there are bounties available for submitting trip reports there is a bounty from

459
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:43,700
 a american organization and there is a bounty from a Canadian organization and when I have

460
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:49,140
 remembered their names I will put links in the show notes the Canadian one has a five year deadline

461
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,860
 and the American one has no deadline so I will get the American one which is five hundred dollars

462
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:58,260
 and there will be five hundred dollars for TAF the benefit of doing Anna's this year is that as

463
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,020
 long as we get it finished by the end of the year she will come under the deadline for the Canadian

464
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:07,060
 bounty as well so that will be a thousand dollars I believe for TAF. Is that five years from the date

465
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,940
 of trip or five years from winning the fund this this seems more relevant than it might be?

466
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:18,020
 It would be as long as we do it by the end of 2020 they are the same that they both of those

467
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,380
 will be true I actually don't know I assume it's from the date of the trip yeah I'm just slightly

468
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:30,900
 worried about this for my guff thing though projects that are left do fester so I kind of think I'm

469
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,940
 going to have to do it within a year of actually making the trip or all of those things that you

470
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:41,540
 remember I will have forgotten though I am when I do the proper trip I am going to take a lot of

471
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:48,980
 recording devices with me I'm going to try and make notes and scribble things onto Facebook and so

472
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:54,420
 on every single day otherwise yeah you know what it's like the words in my trip report were mostly

473
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:01,060
 committed to foundsings within the month after I came back and it is only the kind of written and

474
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:06,500
 nicely formatted trip report those day good ages I wrote all of the words as I was going along

475
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:13,380
 and editing it turns out is is effort I was trying to ask Claire to do it Claire did a proofread

476
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:20,260
 run on mine which took me about three days to go through because it was 500 comments on 25,000

477
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:27,140
 words okay I could beat that I did a poster I did a poster for Dublin it was a big post-scour

478
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:33,460
 on the wall Caroline gave me the words I did the layout I just happened to give it to Claire to

479
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:40,340
 proofread at a party and I think there were 500 comments on that and it was one poster Claire is

480
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:46,660
 a proofreading machine if you ever need a healthy proofread Claire is a good person to proofread

481
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,500
 it I actually think she should probably at some point start charging for her services because she's

482
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,340
 very good and also some of the comments may be laugh and I'm a bit sad no one else will ever get

483
00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:01,060
 to read them you could definitely put an appendix to your trip report that is the funniest bits out

484
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:06,580
 of the proofread there are footnotes in my trip report which are the thing that Claire said about

485
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,900
 that thing and I've just put that in a footnote how are we all feeling about staying sane in the

486
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:16,900
 apocalypse I have to say I'm feeling several degrees less sane than I was a couple of weeks

487
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:24,500
 ago if this were Call of Cthulhu or Arkham Horror or something my insanity would be rising or my sanity

488
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,540
 would be dropping precipitously so actually that's funny you say that because one of the ways me and

489
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:34,420
 Liz have been staying sane in the apocalypse is playing Arkham Horror over a tape drop simulator

490
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,540
 sort of simulating our lapsing sanity in order to prevent it happening in real life

491
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:45,700
 but I must admit I do I can feel my sanity slipping slightly I think I am getting less productive

492
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:53,380
 and slightly more frustrated to be indoors I bought a new portable telephone oh what's portable

493
00:46:53,380 --> 00:47:02,100
 telephone is it it is an iPhone SE so it's exactly like my old iPhone SE except bigger and much flash

494
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:08,740
 ear and very much faster and I'm not quite used to it yet because it feels very big and flashy and

495
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,700
 and it's too slightly too big for my hands which is the reason why I didn't have a phone in that

496
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:18,980
 form factor before phones have got too big for me I might have to go back to one of those little

497
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,860
 Nokia things and then I realized that it was stupid buying a phone because I'm not going out

498
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,900
 anywhere or seeing anyone or doing any of the sorts of things for which it's quite handy to have a

499
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:34,020
 phone on you I ride the review finding that you are turning to retail therapy to stay safe because

500
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,540
 I am definitely I'm spending less money because I'm obviously trapped in my house and I'm definitely

501
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:45,220
 buying more stuff than I was well I've said two things I've said first of all that my mother always

502
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:53,460
 told me to save for a rainy day and this day seems to be pretty rainy as days go so my habit of buying

503
00:47:53,460 --> 00:48:00,500
 nothing in my life has turned into a buy everything in my life so for example during this podcast I

504
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:10,500
 have bought a clamp on microphone stand for a blue snowball microphone from eBay so that next

505
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:17,460
 time we speak I will actually be able to have the snowball right in front of my face Liz how are

506
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,580
 you staying sane and what's the what's the COVID-19 situation like in Thailand are you

507
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,740
 allowed out or are you under curfew what are the what are the restrictions you're under?

508
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,820
 I can't go out between 10 p.m. and 4am which is fine because all the restaurants are published

509
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,380
 at any way so you're not going out drinking you also can't currently buy alcohol but fortunately

510
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:40,740
 I laid in a stockpile of gin I'm doing okay it turns out I'm quite well suited to sitting in the

511
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:45,780
 house all day and not talking to anyone but I have just got a very exciting message saying that

512
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,180
 people are coming around to deliver cookies to me this is not a joke so I will have to leave the

513
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:55,620
 podcast shortly in order to go and collect cookies is that okay that is okay we can use that as our

514
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:01,220
 impetus to ramp up so from the three of us thank you very much for listening to the

515
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:07,700
 Auto Thought podcast and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

516
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:13,940

 picture of them so I can put it in the show notes
