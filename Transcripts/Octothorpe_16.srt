1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
 every time you eat a new food at

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,980
 extencialife by 45 days.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,900
 I don't know if this is a real

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,140
 proper morality and I don't like to

5
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,900
 check too hard because you know,

6
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,620
 you discover that when you check too

7
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,540
 hard, you just go to the Coca-Cola

8
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,900
 does not own the world's second

9
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,500
 largest submarine fleet and things

10
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,340
 like this.

11
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,580
 Who was living a world where

12
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,220
 Coca-Cola is not a meaningful

13
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,220
 naval power?

14
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,980
 They're not a meaningful naval power

15
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,980
 because none of the submarines

16
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,980
 they own work, I'm told.

17
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,820
 That's not the reason I thought.

18
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,020
 That's not the reason I thought

19
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,020
 they wouldn't be.

20
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:42,580
 So that does make me happy in its own way.

21
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,740
 Hello everyone and welcome to the

22
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,260
 16th episode of Octa Thorpe, a science

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,140
 fiction and science fiction fandom

24
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,140
 podcast.

25
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,740
 This is the episode for the 15th of

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,580
 October and those eagerly waiting

27
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,620
 our emergency episode dealing with

28
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,940
 Trump and the coronavirus will be

29
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,420
 disappointed because it has been

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,700
 delayed but we promise it's coming

31
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
 soon.

32
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,700
 I'm Jon Coxon.

33
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,420
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

34
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,440
 We have had two letters of comment.

35
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,500
 We have a letter of comment from

36
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,340
 Karen Schaeffer who says that with

37
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,060
 another episode of Octa Thorpe comes

38
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,780
 another puzzle which is also

39
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,600
 wooden and also has hidden figures

40
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,100
 but this one is in Russian.

41
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,060
 We will attempt to put pictures or a

42
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,660
 link in the show notes.

43
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,060
 Karen has a neighbor who puts the

44
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,460
 edge pieces in a separate bag and

45
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,620
 then when he passes on to what else

46
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,060
 he passes on with the edge pieces

47
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,180
 already in the separate bag which

48
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,580
 seems like removing a part of the

49
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,460
 puzzle making process to Karen and

50
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,460
 to me.

51
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,180
 What's your opinions on this?

52
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,540
 My view is that if you do that you

53
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,060
 might as well be one of these people

54
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,900
 who puts the puzzle very carefully

55
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,220
 in four constructed sections back into

56
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,940
 the box so that the new person doesn't

57
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,220
 have to do anything at all with it

58
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,180
 apart from separate all the pieces

59
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,660
 whilst being quite annoyed but I

60
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,260
 think it's probably quite thoughtful

61
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,260
 to put the edge pieces back in the

62
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,420
 box because people do find sorting the

63
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,900
 edge pieces tedious and if they do

64
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,900
 want to do the puzzle properly and not

65
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,100
 cheat they can just kind of tip the

66
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,860
 edge pieces back into the box before

67
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,260
 they start and shuffle them around and

68
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,740
 that will also be fine.

69
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,500
 That is the thing that Karen notes you

70
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,580
 can do and she says that she dislikes

71
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,940
 what the previous puzzle puts the

72
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,100
 puzzle back in in big chunks which I

73
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,780
 would assume is a fake punishable by

74
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,500
 or sorry an act punishable by death but

75
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,220
 I'm not in the puzzle fandom.

76
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,820
 You just get the box and shake ups up

77
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,180
 and down quite a lot.

78
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,620
 Oh maybe not if you've got a nice fancy

79
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,380
 wooden puzzle that wouldn't work.

80
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,380
 Life hack.

81
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,380
 Yeah and also fairly expensive puzzles

82
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
 it did.

83
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,340
 Yeah I think that the advantage of having

84
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,820
 the puzzle provided in section is that

85
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,180
 it demonstrates that the puzzle is

86
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,940
 complete which as acquiring puzzle

87
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,100
 second hand is a kind of magic pastime

88
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,100
 roulette.

89
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,740
 I mean I suppose roulette is a pastime

90
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,380
 roulette but a kind of Russian pastime

91
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,740
 roulette where you never know until you

92
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,060
 finish the puzzle whether it was

93
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,060
 complete or not.

94
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,260
 I mean my mother and father do an awful

95
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,660
 lot of jigsaw puzzles and his spannier is

96
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,460
 a fan of them as well.

97
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,900
 In our how to stay sane in the apocalypse

98
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,020
 thing one of the things I've been doing

99
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,940
 after Caroline Mullen said she was doing

100
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,740
 jigsaw puzzles online and I said oh that

101
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
 really is a waste of your time dear you

102
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,140
 know that that's a really a really bad

103
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,180
 way to spend time.

104
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,220
 I am a I should not really rag on what

105
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,700
 other people are doing to stay sane in

106
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,940
 the apocalypse but also I started doing

107
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,140
 them because Colin Hins has been posting

108
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,100
 lots of puzzles on a website called

109
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,980
 jigsaw planet and it turns out that I

110
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,620
 quite like doing puzzles that my friends

111
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,860
 have made I find it quite fun and sort

112
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,340
 of connective and so if you're on jigsaw

113
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,780
 puzzle jigsaw planet then I'm behemian

114
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,340
 coast look me up we'll put a link in the

115
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
 show notes.

116
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,900
 Yeah and we have a little community of

117
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,500
 science fiction fans doing each other's

118
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,020
 puzzles that are not particularly

119
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,620
 science fiction all that there are

120
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,700
 photographs so so I became equally sad

121
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,140
 to Caroline and this is a chance to say

122
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,580
 that I have found websites that allow you

123
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,300
 to do large jigsaw puzzles collaboratively

124
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,580
 online and punctuation will probably have

125
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,380
 a jigsaw puzzle that you can do with other

126
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,300
 people because that's one of the things

127
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,780
 we liked. One of the things I've been

128
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,140
 doing one of the things I did on Facebook

129
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,380
 was that I asked people what sort of

130
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,980
 things they like to do and how they were

131
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,700
 doing them online and I got about 300

132
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,340
 replies many of which were things

133
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,540
 activities I had not thought of and my

134
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,700
 next task is to go through that list

135
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,180
 collating them and thinking about how we

136
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,660
 might do them at punctuation. Oh yes that's

137
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,300
 a good idea. No I have thought for some

138
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,500
 time that the fan funds need to do custom

139
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,820
 jigsaws of fanish bookshelves because

140
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,100
 Catherine and Colin have a great bookshelf

141
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,700
 and obviously Clara Mark have several

142
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,580
 great bookshelves but I just suspect

143
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,500
 that you could have a good line in

144
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
 different fans bookshelves and that and

145
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,740
 that could be something you could sell

146
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,660
 for money a fan fund auction but I've

147
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,580
 never got around to seeing if it's easy

148
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,580
 to get custom puzzles made. Neil and Nick

149
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,140
 also have extremely nice bookshelves you

150
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,820
 want extra bookshelves diversity. Yes I

151
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,940
 want as many as we can get. Many many of

152
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,020
 them yeah. We would need the problem is

153
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,500
 that if you go ahead Zazal and look at

154
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,300
 how much it costs to get a thousand

155
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,900
 piece jigsaw made it costs 60 quid so I

156
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,820
 think I think you do you need to go to

157
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,580
 a company you don't want to do it print

158
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,060
 on demand you need to go to a jigsaw

159
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,620
 company and I actually do it properly

160
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,300
 and I have no idea what the minimum

161
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,860
 like numbers are required to make it work.

162
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,380
 Yeah a thousand John come on now it's

163
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,060
 not going to work. Oh but you know what

164
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,260
 would work if you got like Neil Gaiman

165
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,220
 and George R.R. Martin to give you photos

166
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,700
 and then did them as one-off jigsaw

167
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,980
 puzzles like you can have this one-of-a-kind

168
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,820
 jigsaw puzzle of Neil Gaiman's bookshelf

169
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,300
 and you did that a fan fund auction at

170
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,980
 a WorldCom that would go from more than

171
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,700
 60 quid 100% especially if they signed

172
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,940
 it if they did the puzzle signed it broke

173
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,020
 it up and then you got to complete it.

174
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,100
 Have you just asked Neil Gaiman to like

175
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,420
 do a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle? I mean

176
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,060
 we would have to find an author who

177
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,020
 likes jigsaw puzzles. What you would have

178
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,740
 to do is get the jigsaw puzzle do the

179
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,660
 jigsaw puzzle put it very carefully

180
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,140
 back in the box without breaking it so

181
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,420
 that it was in four sections ship it to

182
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,820
 Neil Gaiman. Ship it to Gaiman have

183
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,980
 him sign it send it back that would work.

184
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,180
 No no no no we only you only have to do

185
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,740
 like the the modern corner of the jigsaw

186
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,380
 ship it to him get him to sign it. Oh yeah

187
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,780
 that's true. Have you ever done jigsaws

188
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,980
 you two? Yeah I think it's pretty easy

189
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,220
 just to do a specific corner Alison I

190
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,260
 don't see. No it's not. No no no no you

191
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,100
 you do the whole jigsaw but you'd only

192
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,460
 have to ship like a tiny corner. Better.

193
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,100
 Yeah no I mean I'm just saying though

194
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,180
 I the more I think about that idea the

195
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,660
 more I think that could work in a

196
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,220
 financially lucrative direction. How

197
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,780
 long did it take us to get irretrievably

198
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,740
 off topic? I mean and the great thing is

199
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,380
 there's literally no way. I guess I could

200
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,820
 put this in the podcast just to see if we

201
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,580
 get any locks because if people say that's

202
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,580
 a great idea and I'd spend 300 quid for it

203
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,500
 we know it's a goa. Right in if you would

204
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,940
 spend more than 60 pounds on a jigsaw

205
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,260
 puzzle of a famous author's bookshelf

206
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,100
 right in and let us know because that is

207
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,420
 useful information. Anyway we now move on

208
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,900
 from this emergency fan fund planning

209
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,100
 meeting to Liz's hand up. My I'm still

210
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,740
 commenting on Karen's letter of comment.

211
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,380
 Oh yeah we're still on Karen's log like

212
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,500
 it's all nested. Okay that's fine. Octa

213
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,540
 thought a podcast of jigsaws and fandom.

214
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,340
 It's because she says you know a puzzle

215
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,860
 may take up more than a

216
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,540
 painting but has the advantage that it

217
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,380
 goes back in the box afterwards and I

218
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,220
 cannot deny this is the advantage but

219
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,500
 what's actually going to happen to my

220
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,100
 paint by numbers is I will finish my

221
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,540
 paint by numbers. I will look at it and

222
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,460
 go yeah that was fun and then I will

223
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,460
 probably throw it away so it won't take

224
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,660
 up much space at all. Oh poor paint by

225
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,300
 numbers. I am made sense though. It's a

226
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,660
 journey not a destination. Exactly. I mean

227
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
 speaking as somebody who's got a build

228
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,980
 at yourself, Erdie Gurdie in the study

229
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,140
 that I can't quite bring myself to

230
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,260
 sling but has actual no merit. It has no

231
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,740
 Erdie Gurdie related merit because it

232
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,980
 it sounds like a cat being strangled.

233
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,220
 Karen wrote to us about puzzles and it

234
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,820
 was very good. Thank you Karen.

235
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,540
 Claire writes to us to say that Mark has

236
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,420
 Claire Breyerley of Croydon writes to us

237
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,340
 and tells us that Mark has also been on

238
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,580
 holiday this week and they have not been

239
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,780
 away and she notes that

240
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,180
 Waltham so hearing that Waltham so is

241
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,820
 great for holidays is really nice because

242
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
 it means that she might try it one day

243
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,660
 but she then asks whether she should

244
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,900
 believe everything she hears on podcasts

245
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,060
 and then she tells us off for not letting

246
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,220
 her join punctuation. Sorry Claire. We

247
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,540
 have never rectified that. I think on the

248
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,500
 basis of the last week I cannot

249
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,660
 really claim that Waltham so is great for

250
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,140
 holidays. Oh yeah. No I mean it was fine.

251
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,700
 Hey here.

252
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,020
 Far and on that very enthusiastic bombshell.

253
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:45,580
 So last weekend was Fyerturicon which was

254
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,940
 the virtual Eurocon membership was 10

255
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,020
 euros um Alison through a party and gave a

256
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,540
 talk which I missed because I was playing

257
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,100
 Arkham Horror of the card game with Liz.

258
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,500
 Oops.

259
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,700
 Okay I'm I'm not feeling even a little bit

260
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,020
 hurt.

261
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,660
 I wasn't a member of Futuricon so I'm not

262
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,100
 sure I would be allowed to come to your

263
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,220
 talk. Well I'm I'm very much hoping that

264
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,220
 I'm going to I thought I was recording

265
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,660
 it but apparently I wasn't recording it

266
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,100
 but they were recording it and they're

267
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,420
 basically like we will put the recordings

268
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,660
 up and I'm like yes but I want the

269
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,980
 recording because A) I'm hoping that

270
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,980
 somebody in fact somebody is offered

271
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,580
 Richard Bredger is offered to transcribe

272
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,860
 it so that it gives me some text towards

273
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,100
 the virtual GuffTrip report but also I

274
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,620
 wanted to just like shove it on the

275
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,660
 GuffTrip's Facebook page and it will be a

276
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
 bit past its prime by the time they

277
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,700
 actually get around to send him with

278
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,060
 the recording so I know they've got it

279
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,900
 but they haven't sent it to me or put it

280
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,580
 anywhere that I can grab it. I used I

281
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,380
 used software called Mm-hmm which we can

282
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,900
 put a link to in the show notes which is

283
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,580
 in beta and for Mac only but was very very

284
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,980
 nifty and it's just basically software

285
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,140
 that allows you to to manage your slide

286
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,660
 deck whilst having you as a little

287
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,100
 disembodied head in front of it and it

288
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,380
 worked really quite well after I rigged

289
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,820
 up the green screen in the study so I

290
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,980
 gave a talk it went down I think quite

291
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,700
 well but it was very talking into the

292
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,420
 void because I couldn't see any of the

293
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,100
 audience I did have some people on chat

294
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,380
 but I didn't have anybody with their

295
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,740
 faces and I am not used to that and I

296
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,980
 had a party because apparently that's

297
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,380
 what I do. Futuritcon pre-recorded a lot

298
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,380
 of its content which made it easier for

299
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,740
 them to and then they streamed it they

300
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,300
 used Jitsi as the back end and then they

301
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,460
 streamed it through OBS I think so that

302
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,340
 as a member you just kind of clicked on a

303
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,980
 stream and that sort of worked quite well

304
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,460
 but they had it set up in a way that

305
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,380
 they for pot they made it very easy for

306
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,980
 participants by giving them one click

307
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,140
 link but their one click link for me

308
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,140
 didn't it only it only put my camera onto

309
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,700
 their Jitsi it didn't allow me to choose

310
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,300
 different cameras and of course I wanted

311
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
 the combined feed from the software I was

312
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,220
 using this is probably a bit more

313
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,820
 technical detail than we need for this but

314
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,780
 I think there is a big takeaway for other

315
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,420
 online conventions here which is that

316
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,940
 saying to your program participants

317
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,020
 we will send you a link you can click 10

318
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,820
 minutes before your item is going to drop

319
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,980
 certain sorts of people anyone who is

320
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,460
 kind of nervous about how their tech might

321
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,580
 work into a flat spin and I'm here to

322
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,300
 say I am not very nervous about how my

323
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,620
 tech would work and I was absolutely

324
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,620
 bricking it before that presentation

325
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,300
 because I had I was like I can kind of

326
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,980
 contacted them a couple of days in advance

327
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,580
 and said can I have a tech run through

328
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,940
 for just five or ten minutes to make sure

329
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,300
 the tech I'm using all works with your

330
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,980
 system and they were like no he will send

331
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,340
 you the link 10 minutes and advance and

332
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,420
 it will work and I mean it did but I mean

333
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,980
 it's reassuring that it did just work

334
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,580
 it didn't just work it worked because I

335
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,180
 kind of shouted at them and said send me

336
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,060
 the direct link so I can launch Jitsi and

337
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,180
 feed by um um feed through it yeah yeah

338
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,340
 that is a stupid day for an app it's uh

339
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,420
 I've put a link in the show notes so if you

340
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,420
 are wondering how the f*ck do you spell

341
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,820
 mm-hmm then look at the show notes and it

342
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,340
 tells you it's spelt exactly as it sounds

343
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,580
 it's spelt and well yeah but then the

344
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,740
 question is like how long is the mm

345
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,780
 and how long is the mm and that is the sort

346
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,700
 of question that we really do you into

347
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,460
 here on the old thought podcast indeed

348
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,180
 okay but you also threw a party how did the

349
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,860
 party go I went to the party because the

350
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,180
 party did not require that I be a member

351
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,580
 of Futuricon it required that I ask

352
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,820
 Alison for a zoom link yeah that that

353
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,340
 technique did actually work for a couple

354
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,300
 of people at the um at the octagon

355
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,620
 parties but it was I had explicitly told

356
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,300
 people I wouldn't do it for octagon but

357
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,340
 for for Futuricon I just ran a party

358
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,140
 it was at an official convention item

359
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,220
 the convention didn't have any parties

360
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,460
 and its only social space was discord and I

361
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,740
 find um somebody who should be

362
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
 nameless but who is lily and edwards

363
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,940
 said "Ha ha!" discord is just clunky

364
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,780
 i-r-c isn't it and she's kind of got a

365
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,420
 point so so text chat is all very well

366
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,660
 but it is only text chat and I find it

367
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,220
 is not an adequate for me it is not an

368
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,980
 adequate substitute for actually getting

369
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,740
 together and hanging out with people

370
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,140
 in a way that zoom is also not an adequate

371
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,900
 substitute for getting together and hanging

372
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,620
 out with people but it's a much for me zoom

373
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,380
 is a much better substitute for that than

374
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,540
 any amount of text chat i'm not convinced

375
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,700
 discord has any functionality that's not

376
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,900
 possible in IRC gift sallison

377
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,980
 gifts oh no okay you know IRC is kind of

378
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,140
 I mean you could do a lot with IRC so I

379
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,980
 mean discord IRC is extremely flexible

380
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,300
 the problem is that IRC's got a kind of

381
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,980
 roll your own vibe to it that discord

382
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,660
 doesn't um though I will say the thing

383
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,660
 that I most hate about discord which is

384
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,380
 that it is incredibly difficult to export

385
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,620
 text from discord and I I really this this

386
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,700
 actually gives me the heebie gb's I do not

387
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,740
 like working in platforms that don't

388
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,820
 want you to export the things you write

389
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,220
 in them I don't I like that that is a

390
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,300
 valid christ you know and that and I'm not

391
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,780
 I think it's a deliberate design decision

392
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,020
 and I I hate it with a fiery passion I am

393
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,940
 all about the capturing the things I write

394
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,780
 for posterity um I think um so but I think I

395
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,540
 think there's two things where I think I

396
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,100
 think saying discord is clunky IRC like I

397
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,260
 think is the other way around I think IRC is clunky

398
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,500
 discord I know I know that discord came

399
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,900
 after IRC and it turns out like a proprietary

400
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,140
 software where somebody is making a profit

401
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,500
 though they probably aren't actually and IRC is

402
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,540
 a big old open source thing that nobody owns

403
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,260
 and is out there for the whole world to use as they

404
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,620
 as they need which is why it is hello clunky

405
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,900
 oh yeah discord came about to replace a

406
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,380
 piece of software called mumble and I say

407
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,300
 replace and like people who know more about

408
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,700
 this are yelling at their podcast playing

409
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,780
 device at the moment but effectively like

410
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,180
 mumble and team speak are both things where

411
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,260
 you could host a server for mumble or

412
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,700
 team speak and you could invite your friends

413
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,620
 to your server and they could voice chat on

414
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,980
 that server with you while you're playing

415
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,860
 games and they were very good and um the

416
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,900
 Mac app for mumble um is very very very bad

417
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,980
 and I dislike it intensely um and team speak is

418
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,220
 quite expensive because hosting a team speak

419
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,460
 server is not cheap and they're both very

420
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,220
 good and discord basically came along and

421
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,380
 said we're going to do this thing where

422
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,580
 we will offer you voice chat in an application that is

423
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,180
 nice instead of massively clunky and it

424
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,660
 will be free and in exchange we will sell

425
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,140
 you discord night throw and access to more

426
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,340
 emoji and try and make money in this way

427
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,180
 and in some ways that's a very compelling value

428
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,620
 proposition and I do and then as times gone on

429
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,860
 discord has started to compete more and more with

430
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,300
 slack so I think slack is the original um

431
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,540
 IRC replacement um proprietary platform

432
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,980
 um and then discord had text channels alongside

433
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,420
 the voice channels but it was more of an

434
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,780
 afterthought at the beginning and it has

435
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,740
 become discord has become more and more used

436
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,380
 for text chat primarily driven by reddit

437
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,060
 but it's a really interesting landscape and a

438
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,820
 landscape that i've seen developed from both

439
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,580
 ends because i use slack professionally and

440
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,860
 discord for leisure and um yes

441
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,180
 as so does everybody else so one of the

442
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,180
 things about zoom that we see one of the

443
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,660
 reasons i run all the zoom parties is that i

444
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,460
 don't use zoom at all professionally i mean

445
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,100
 i do very occasionally but basically i do

446
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,660
 not have to do video meetings with my

447
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,620
 colleagues regularly so you see quite a lot of

448
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,780
 people who don't like zoom parties because

449
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,420
 they associate zoom with things that they

450
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,740
 don't like like interminable meetings with

451
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,820
 their colleagues and you see and the

452
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,460
 the different although the slack and discord are in

453
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,780
 many ways i don't they aren't in many ways i don't

454
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,940
 at all but they have an awful lot of overlap

455
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,740
 and you see a lot of people who are like well i

456
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,220
 don't really want to be doing things socially

457
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,060
 and slack because i have slack the entire

458
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,780
 service in my work part of my brain is where i am

459
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,100
 on slack when i'm on slack i'm working

460
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,500
 when i'm although obviously there's a there's a

461
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,900
 queue in the name people lots of people slack is

462
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,740
 quite a good place for not working with the

463
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,860
 people that you work with um and then discord is

464
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,820
 is an entirely social space it is primarily social though of

465
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,660
 course some people who are using it for work

466
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,340
 and um and we're seeing so we see some of that with zoom as well

467
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,900
 and i think this is actually a huge um

468
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,540
 misstep on slack spark so i think slack if slack had had a more coherent

469
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,100
 mechanism for monetization at the low end

470
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,060
 slack would have much of this market and discord wouldn't really have had a

471
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,860
 look in but because slack has this model where

472
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,380
 if you want to upgrade to the first paid tier you have to pay 10 pounds per

473
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,500
 month per user it's basically the gulf between

474
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,580
 free and the lowest paid tier is so gigantic if you're not

475
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,780
 in enterprise that there's just no way you could possibly do it

476
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,220
 it's quite possible that slack dude just just do not care about trying to

477
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,740
 monetize low end users they're quite happy where they are

478
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,260
 which is providing paid services to businesses because they're more of a

479
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,860
 Microsoft Teams competitor than they are a discord competitor

480
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,260
 this is point leads on to something i do want to talk about and indeed put to the

481
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,580
 show notes which is that next week zoom is um

482
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,660
 holding its annual conference which does every year called zoom topia but this

483
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,620
 year it is free and online and i am going to take two days out of my life

484
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,140
 and go to it and as lis says these companies are not really aiming at the

485
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,580
 social market but zoom has a big social market

486
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,220
 and i want to go and be extremely difficult to them and talk to them a lot

487
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,220
 about what they should be doing um to nurture all the people who are

488
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,580
 having fun on zoom i feel that their conference

489
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,260
 thing doesn't really include enough about fun and i feel that it's actually

490
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,780
 would have merits for their corporate business as well because

491
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,980
 the big thing that businesses are losing as they go online as as people

492
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,660
 work from home much more is that that sense of collegiate fellowship

493
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,780
 is being lost in many workplaces and i actually did need that it you do better

494
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,940
 job work if you like and get on and have fun with the people that you work

495
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,220
 with who knew um so anyway i'm going to go talk to them a lot about that

496
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,780
 and i will come back and report but that's all happening before

497
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,100
 this episode goes out so by the time you hear this i will have already done it

498
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,860
 um and i want to mention their dress code because it said what is the dress

499
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,980
 code for online zoom topia and they said

500
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,220
 business on the top casual on the bottom well okay that works which i thought

501
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,500
 was quite funny and and i think zoom topia

502
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,100
 although there's nothing on the website about it having social space

503
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,660
 um the email gives me some hope it's kind of saying oh it's got lots of

504
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,580
 um different spaces that you'll be able to go and explore and get

505
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,300
 virtual virtual tokens and if you get enough of these virtual tokens you can

506
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,260
 cash them in for prizes such as virtual ribbons or

507
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:45,100
 merch or even a conversation with the a half az zoom with the ceo of zoom and i'm

508
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,620
 like oh that would be funny oh my goodness can you

509
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,180
 imagine allison getting to talk to the ceo of zoom

510
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,980
 recording for the podcast allison do it as an interview

511
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,820
 i mean obviously if i talk to the ceo of zoom i will be recording the

512
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,580
 meeting if i am allowed to do so and if i'm not allowed to do so i'll just be

513
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,740
 recording the meeting but not in zoom um

514
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,260
 don't tell them don't don't put that we can't put that out of the podcast

515
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,940
 i'm gonna bleep it so going back to future a con

516
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,980
 how did you so the reason i did not join was because i did not see a coherent

517
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,180
 social i think for me like i think the way conventions are using discord at the

518
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,900
 moment to kind of be the backbone of the convention and offer

519
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,780
 kind of a place to talk in between program items

520
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,620
 is like a good one and i think running the convention through the discord i.e

521
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,780
 having links to the parties and the panels on your discards

522
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,540
 on your discord server is a good way to kind of

523
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,220
 unify everything and and have people have a kind of

524
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,900
 central place to get information which is i think cool

525
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,100
 but i will say that like i didn't join future a con because it didn't seem to

526
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,140
 have a story for like social zooms or anything like that

527
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,700
 so what do you think about what do you think about that because like for me

528
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,260
 the big appeal of like oh there's a convention this weekend is

529
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,460
 i get to like you know beyond zoom in the evening and talk to interesting

530
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,460
 people and future a con other than the party you ran us and didn't seem to do

531
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,100
 that very much it didn't do it at all and it was

532
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,060
 really strange because they started by having a very sad

533
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,620
 little video of kind of what what future a con was like last year when it

534
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,940
 wasn't the year con and i'm sure it had lots of panels and

535
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,540
 events and things but nearly all of this

536
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,140
 the of the video shots from this convention with of people

537
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,780
 hanging out in a space and having fun together

538
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,860
 and i felt that they didn't really do anything like enough of that and the

539
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,340
 reliance on pre-recorded content made meant that quite a lot of their

540
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,300
 programming was less interactive than you would want it to be as well

541
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,580
 so although there was chat going on and they were

542
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,300
 they they basically had a chat in the live stream on the internet which i think

543
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,340
 is not a terribly good idea and they also had a chat

544
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,260
 in the discord which i think probably work quite a bit better i think twitch

545
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,020
 might give us the best of both of these worlds because twitch chat

546
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,780
 would work perfectly well and in fact has worked perfectly well for octagon

547
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,620
 um it does mean that people need to join another service but you know

548
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,060
 twitch is another good service that you should probably be a member of already

549
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,900
 um twitch i don't think twitch has quite realized yet that they're um

550
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,940
 they're going to be used as people suddenly realize they can be used for

551
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,340
 everything they will be used for everything and not really for

552
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,940
 streaming games i'm the fucking internet historian today

553
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,820
 i do apologize but twitch was originally a service called justin.tv

554
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,940
 which is a bloke called justin who just bloke quite like streaming random

555
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,820
 things and then twitch came about because everyone

556
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,300
 latched on to justin tv for game streaming and he launched twitch

557
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,260
 as a um companion to justin tv that was specifically for games

558
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,740
 and then eventually justin tv died because everyone just went to twitch

559
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,260
 and i think i think it's interesting to see that kind of coming the other way

560
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,860
 but i don't know whether twitch i don't know whether twitch needs to

561
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,060
 i don't know the extent to which twitch needs to take action is not clear to me

562
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,860
 because it might just be that they can carry on in the way they are and still

563
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,060
 kind of attract multiple groups i don't know

564
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:17,020
 and of course twitch is amazon speaking of evil evil corporate

565
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,700
 overlords so octagon avoided the fact that zoom webinars are expensive by just

566
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,300
 streaming out twitch and then encouraging people to chat in twitch

567
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,060
 which i think is it's a good way of doing it perfectly sensible i mean

568
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,500
 i have a vision of what twitch chat is like which is very different from my

569
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,380
 vision of what the chat stream at science fiction

570
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,220
 conventions is like so i don't know whether they've ended up somewhere in

571
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,660
 the middle but i normally think of twitch chat as being like a

572
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,780
 continuous stream of of unreadable copy pastor and memes

573
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,140
 well i mean is that meaningfully different to an east con bar

574
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,380
 mahingi liz how did you find futuricon programming

575
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,860
 oh i did not go to futuricon i thought you'd been to like a panel

576
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:06,460
 that was at the right time no okay no i didn't because it wasn't

577
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,700
 free it was like some small amount of cash but it didn't really seem worth it

578
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,580
 for the one to two panels i would be able to make

579
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,100
 and while i do believe you party hard you did not party hard enough to still

580
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,580
 be partying in my time zone we have been failing to do that

581
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,700
 did not attend any of it well it does require you to party essentially until

582
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,340
 probably at least one or two a.m we party till one o'clock last night

583
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,580
 yeah but but we were very we were very tired at one

584
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,300
 exactly well it's because we'd also party till

585
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,980
 one the night before and i had gotten drunk at noon yesterday

586
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,740
 so realistically i just made a series of bad bad life choices

587
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,260
 but i actually have uh liz i don't know if you were to see this

588
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,860
 i actually have a widget on my phone that tells me the time in bangcock that i

589
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,020
 can look at when i'm partying to see the likelihood that liz will be there

590
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,260
 oh that's sweet that's so thoughtful oh that's very nice

591
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,260
 but you don't it's very thoughtful though when do you think i get up in a

592
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,740
 morning john ah i um i think you get up at

593
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,780
 nine thirty that is on a weekend not far off well done john

594
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,260
 nice but it's fine because the i mean the reason to have that widget also is

595
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,220
 because the the time difference is not fixed

596
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,100
 hmm yeah because of daylight savings time

597
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,340
 by by the time of punctuation it will be seven hours which means i will be more

598
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,220
 likely to wake up in the morning when you're partying but actually i'll

599
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,620
 probably stay awake far too late anyway

600
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:43,020
 yay list list list list um so yes so fair enough um

601
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,180
 and i i meant to go to octagon programming and then completely failed to

602
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,220
 do so because i was busy doing social things

603
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,980
 which pleasingly replicates the experience of real convention so that's

604
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,660
 good i was interested in the fourth way feminism panel

605
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,900
 and i'm hoping that it might be recorded although i suspect i will be hoping

606
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,980
 uh in vain because i don't know if they're recording anything

607
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,220
 some twitch in it oh maybe make a good twitch yeah

608
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,420
 because that sounded really interesting and alleybakers great so

609
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,300
 yeah i kind of think if these things are on twitch then

610
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,020
 then you just get recording free and it keeps it for 30 days or something which

611
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,060
 feels ideal for me and you know i'm thinking stuff will be

612
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,180
 and you can export them out you can export them out to youtube as well from

613
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,060
 twitch um no twitch does it twitch increases the

614
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:37,500
 technology load um and it increases it like i think appreciably

615
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,780
 but it does seem like quite a good way of doing some of these things and i'm

616
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,260
 basically a very jealous of octagon because they're doing all the things i

617
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,580
 thought would be neat to do at punctuation but they're doing them five

618
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,740
 weeks earlier yeah so so octagon had i known octagon was

619
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,860
 existing and was doing a lot of the stuff i thought

620
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,340
 the convention should be doing um i mean i think that we will have more of

621
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,940
 it and more of the social stuff and that will all be fine

622
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,660
 um but i think um i think they are doing they are coming a lot

623
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,700
 close to my platonic ideal of what online

624
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,220
 convention should be like than any previous convention that i've been to

625
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,300
 they have a thing which i've not been to any of yet which are called fan chats

626
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,780
 which are essentially zoom get-togethers on a theme which is obviously like the

627
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:26,620
 kind of workshops we're planning to have um and and they have quite a lot of

628
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:32,540
 space that's thematic in the um in the discord's got quite a lot of kind of

629
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,660
 themed channels and things so you can hang out and talk about

630
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,860
 the sorts of things you'd like to talk about like pets or crafting

631
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,260
 yes whatever else that fans talk about book recommendations and things about

632
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,700
 these seem like the right sorts of things to be doing and i am having

633
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,100
 quite a good time um but i i did run both the parties

634
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,300
 which was kind of accidental because because Glasgow said can you run a party

635
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,340
 for us and i was like well of course Glasgow that's what i do um

636
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,420
 that's that is my the thing that i'm giving to the Glasgow 2024 World Cup bid

637
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,580
 is that i sit in zoom and then we thought it would be fun to have a punctuation

638
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,540
 party on the friday night so so we ended up having

639
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,980
 two parties with me doing both of them and um they have i believe they are having

640
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,540
 a dead dog tonight the john de_labelle the punctuation party

641
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,140
 and there are plenty of Glasgow people who would have helped the Glasgow party but

642
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,580
 so James Shields at the punctuation party was excellent because he brought

643
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,060
 some punctuation to the party and he was awarded one point

644
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,460
 and for those who don't know what points do

645
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,140
 firstly respect Bruce Forsyth come on but secondly uh you'll find out when you

646
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,940
 come to punctuation i think it's highly likely that

647
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,900
 points don't mean prizes unless you mean by prizes some kind of virtual badge or

648
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,860
 ribbon or some kind i'm not saying it's a good prize

649
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,900
 yeah yeah full disclaimer we make no guarantees of quality of

650
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,980
 prizes on this podcast or our convention i always take no

651
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:03,260
 vicon as a guide because um whenever i hear the police dog

652
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,620
 hogan's song which is white wine it makes me think of no

653
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,220
 vicon and the prizes for events oh i have no comment um

654
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,660
 liz what did you think of octagon programming uh i am in 20 octagon

655
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,220
 programming no i tell a lie i went to one piece of octagon programming

656
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,980
 which is they popped in this chord saying that they were randomly gonna stream

657
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,500
 the chair of the convention playing untitled goose game between panels and

658
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,700
 so i watched someone run around trying to play goose

659
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,140
 game uh on twitch for 10 minutes while people in the chat tried to give helpful

660
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,020
 suggestions about you know maybe carry some carrots or something

661
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,260
 and it was great um and then i meant to go to some panels

662
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:49,260
 but uh i was watching the cycle racing ah okay for enough for enough so yeah

663
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,220
 that is your other problem it's clashing with the attempts to put entire sport

664
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,700
 seasons into a two-month window yeah and then of course

665
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,500
 you know half the programming is too late for me

666
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,700
 so i didn't go to any of that and i failed the party as well

667
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,860
 it's very sad but i'm quite enjoying the discord and i think what i have seen of it

668
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,660
 is well set up and i do like their twitch streaming

669
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,860
 yes all right i hadn't realized they were doing untitled

670
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,340
 goose game in between but that is most excellent

671
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,300
 that was spontaneous i think they spontaneously just decided

672
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,820
 hey we've got some time let's have some goose game

673
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,460
 which is the kind of programming that one day i will be able to play untitled

674
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,220
 goose game you can play it now you got a switch

675
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,660
 you got a switch yeah on my ipad just get out of your switch

676
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,980
 allison is like 13 pounds okay i don't i should say i don't

677
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,100
 actually own a switch oh you're son owns a switch

678
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,460
 my son owns a switch so i mean i can do it and in fact

679
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,940
 obviously jonathan doesn't play switch all the time

680
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,100
 that's not i don't believe you that's not that doesn't tell you with any of the

681
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,540
 things you've ever said about jonathan or his switch

682
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,380
 um he is quite often playing on his laptop

683
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,980
 ah is he okay i mean it you know there are lots of hours of the day and

684
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,660
 switch gaming does not fill all of them it does if you try hard enough that's

685
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,140
 what i'm saying not if you have a knockulous quest

686
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:19,260
 yeah okay so is that so what are we what are we going to steal from octaton

687
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,420
 for punctuation everything i've sorted out with kathryn that we'll have a

688
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,340
 debrief middle and next week and can i come

689
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,940
 nickelling stuff i haven't had to sort it out of time for it but that's

690
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,780
 kind of that sort of time oh cool okay no because i do think and i do

691
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,380
 wonder whether this indicates that there are people

692
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,020
 because i mean obviously so not to disrespect the

693
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,780
 the fine and distinguished nuances between

694
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,180
 irish and british fandom but i think in many ways irish british fandom share

695
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,220
 uh quite a lot of dna in terms of like a general approach to

696
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,700
 program and social spaces at conventions perhaps

697
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,100
 and um i do wonder the extent to which like octacon is a sign that

698
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,740
 this end of the world are thinking about virtual conventions and beginning to

699
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,820
 come to the realization that perhaps they do need to be a bit more

700
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,220
 you know octaconne or east connie on over connie and um

701
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,380
 and yeah i've been thoroughly enjoying octacon in a way that um previous

702
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,340
 conventions have not quite been doing it the same way for me so um

703
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,300
 hats off to the octaconne career then they've been doing a fantastic job

704
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,980
 no it's been very good and of course octaconne is free which is making

705
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,900
 five pounds look terribly expensive but it doesn't look as expensive as

706
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,620
 some conventions i could mention a segue allison

707
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,380
 well what what are these other conventions to which you refer

708
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:45,740
 so in a in a move that i think will um as pleased a lot of us actually we're

709
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,900
 very pleased congratulations to confusion for um

710
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,780
 announcing that they are going to hybridize their

711
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,060
 convention that they will have physical elements if they can but they will

712
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,300
 also be planning for an online convention for easter 2021

713
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,660
 it's very good stuff very very good stuff i think

714
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,420
 that when we say we are hoping to have a hybrid convention it's a bit like when

715
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,020
 they say your dog has gone to live on a farm with

716
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,500
 all the other old dogs when it's going to be happy and play all the time

717
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,940
 i still think there is no chance that we will have anything that is at all like

718
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,300
 a convention in at easter though i i still i held out a tiny amount of hope

719
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,780
 that we might be able to gather locally in small groups by then

720
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,660
 and there's a thing that you could you might be able to say

721
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,220
 actually we're going to say we're going to tell you who else is a member of the

722
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,780
 convention is your area if you want to meet up in a

723
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,340
 pub or something which i think would be quite a cool thing

724
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,060
 if we're allowed to do that in atista which i think is

725
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,700
 you know possible possible maybe not very light yeah i mean if you assume by

726
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,260
 if you assume easter will have hopefully relatively pleasant weather then it

727
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,300
 could be like okay well you know ten of you are now

728
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,020
 allowed to go and sit in a beer garden and drink beer together

729
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,980
 and we are encouraged and so you could do things like say we're encouraging

730
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,580
 everyone to do that yeah and maybe at a particular time

731
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,620
 and that would and then we could have like a photo like a photo stream of

732
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,860
 photos for all of these gatherings and i think that sort of thing could be

733
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,460
 very agreeable and foster that sense of the

734
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,660
 of the community that the the community getting together so i think there are

735
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,980
 some things that they could do that are short of

736
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,460
 we will actually have a thousand people in a room

737
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,740
 in at the n_e_c_ because i don't that that doesn't seem

738
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,740
 terribly likely um and they've announced a price which is 50 pounds

739
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,260
 and yes and that was the basis of your segue

740
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,820
 ooh it was and what they said and there is a quote which we should probably use

741
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,980
 but i paraphrasing they've said doing this properly cost money

742
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:50,380
 um and and in that they are they are they are not wrong

743
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,420
 but they might not be right whether or not it costs 50 pounds is the tricky

744
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,180
 thing right i i'm curious to see the thing with

745
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,620
 the thing with consieland was that they said doing this properly costs money

746
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,380
 and they charged money and then they did it the same way as all the

747
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,540
 conventions who don't charge money did it or the

748
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,820
 conventions the charge 10 quid did it oh no they had lots of stuff so

749
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,340
 so one of the things that certainly costs some money is putting a paywall on

750
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,020
 your convention yes no and that is a good

751
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,180
 point that is a that is a very good point and and you clearly do want to have some

752
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,460
 sort of paywall on the easter con i think um

753
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,700
 octagon's not charging but as a tip bucket do do throw a fiber into that tip

754
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,020
 bucket if if you're enjoying the convention by the way

755
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,940
 but at the moment there's no clear evidence to me

756
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,100
 that using the free services or the very cheap basic services and then

757
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,300
 stitching them together in kind of with

758
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,380
 vanish gaffer tape is producing a result that's any worse

759
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,540
 than what you buy if you buy an integrated events solution

760
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,700
 and integrated events event solutions are expensive they are

761
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,460
 i i've kind of i'm not suggesting that that 50 pounds is not a good amount to

762
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,100
 charge and i have had at least one conversation with

763
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,620
 john tord who's working on um the easter con about something i kind of

764
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,140
 wanted to do for punctuation he was like oh yeah that takes service and lots of

765
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,420
 money and i was like oh yeah no i can see how it might

766
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,500
 and i and so that sort of thing they can easily do well

767
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,700
 with a budget of 50 quid ahead you could get a lot of

768
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,380
 good stuff for that and and anyway 50 quid ahead is still less than i paid

769
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,060
 for the easter con by a very long chalk and i have joined and i have totally

770
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,180
 forgotten the 50 pounds by easter so i'm perfectly happy with that

771
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,340
 but i would like to see their budget i just want to know i want to know

772
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,500
 where they think they're spending the money because i think actually starting

773
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,940
 to have that conversation about what things are really worth spending this

774
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,540
 money on and what things are maybe not worth spending the money on

775
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:52,300
 it's good i have joined easter con i joined um before it was online so i don't

776
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,060
 know if i'll get my 20 quid back but oh well 20 quid

777
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:02,140
 literally by half a board game um i think and i think you're right i think

778
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,460
 there is a there's a compelling argument to be made that you might be able to do

779
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,540
 some of this stuff better if you do charge like serious money and like

780
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,940
 i didn't go to conzeland um and i know that they did

781
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,460
 use things that they wouldn't be able to do had they not charged money so that

782
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:25,100
 is a good point i think that um i'm just i'm i'm still curious about the value

783
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,860
 proposition but i am rooting for them i will be

784
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,140
 attending because it is my home convention i've never missed an easter

785
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,580
 con don't plan to start now i i'm i'm definitely going to be there i

786
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:42,940
 mean i i i i was somebody when i was with bells on

787
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,300
 in with bells on somebody is a thread that i

788
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,780
 announced this in said and i think this is a very reasonable question is that

789
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,100
 per person or per household i assume per person but it is a reasonable

790
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,140
 question and it is of course per person but i think i think there's a real

791
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,260
 question for online conventions whether you should be saying

792
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:08,060
 we are going to charge you x amount per household and then extra people are

793
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,860
 a little bit extra but your your basic membership gets you that one stream

794
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,180
 because you're not i think so i think the problem i mean it's okay if you're

795
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,700
 john and his spannier and you have two totally separated offices

796
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,420
 but lots of households essentially sit on a sofa and do the zoom together

797
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,620
 i think i think what it needs to be is it needs to be per

798
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,700
 um account it's like if you are planning to be on the sofa together and just

799
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,220
 usually what account then paying once i think is fine and i don't know

800
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,780
 this is not the obviously this is not the opinion of confusion the 2020 what

801
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,420
 is to come because uh i am not um involved with that

802
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,500
 convention um but like my my assumption is it's basically per

803
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,220
 account and i think i think that would be the

804
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,220
 sensible way to do it if you were going to be doing it per household and like

805
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,020
 trying to implement some sort of like oh you know if you've got multiple

806
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,340
 accounts but you're in one household will give you some sort of discount

807
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,900
 that's enormously complicated you don't need the extra mental load

808
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,820
 but equally like if say me and his family decide we're just going to pay

809
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,620
 once and then everything we do at least call we're going to do together

810
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,500
 i kind of don't really think that council's ghosting i wouldn't feel bad

811
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,140
 about doing that so like that that would be more

812
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,340
 instinctive reaction but i don't know i don't know how they'll do it

813
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,500
 but by the time somebody raised this i had already bought two memberships for

814
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,300
 myself and my husband despite the fact that you know

815
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,420
 Stephen really doesn't do this online convention stuff he just kind of hangs

816
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,460
 around in the background of parties sometimes but i mean i think in that

817
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,180
 case i think you could yeah you could definitely get

818
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,060
 i've got away with one membership for that but i mean i think

819
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:43,180
 if you do have it never even i mean i did say to him do you want me to buy you a

820
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,220
 membership but i i was kind of doing it in a kind of

821
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,140
 because of but of course you do dear because it's the easter con and

822
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,780
 we really want to express lots of enthusiastic and vigorous support for

823
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,500
 our home convention which we which we love in

824
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,740
 ordinarily so there was a bit of that but it's also yeah it should be one account

825
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,020
 because it should be one account where you know

826
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,340
 then you can't be watching two panels at once and you get one account for the

827
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,940
 discord otherwise it seems a bit unreasonable for those people who can't

828
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,980
 split the prices though i do feel quite strongly that with

829
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,340
 whether i'm one membership i should be able to watch two panels at once if i

830
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,460
 want to say you know

831
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,020
 well i want to eat screens well one on each of my several screens i

832
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,540
 you know especially if they're not recording like like that scene from

833
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,780
 serenity where he's just watching the whole universe's news all at once

834
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,260
 because he's so good at news i love that movie but there are some

835
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:44,060
 haunt choices yeah my thinking is i'm just not sure at this point it's even

836
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,420
 worth aiming for a hybrid convention because

837
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,580
 i think that'll be really difficult it is an interesting one right because

838
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:56,220
 i think it's laudable but if it's going to cause a lot more stress and a lot more

839
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,860
 hassle and it's going to be unlikely to come off

840
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,420
 even even if you put the work in i do i do wonder at which point you just say

841
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,140
 like i i think it's still very likely that they have

842
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,540
 contractual obligations to the hotel that mean that they cannot

843
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,140
 ditch at this stage i think you need to be very

844
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:22,780
 soothing and kind to conventions that are supposed to be running online

845
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,540
 further yeah yes so liz are you going to

846
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:34,620
 timeshift and attendees to come i might um i'm trying to remember when

847
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,860
 easter is this year yeah i think if i'm gonna

848
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:43,420
 uh it was a while ago well next year is late april so i think we may have gone

849
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,260
 back to s no it's april of the fourth april of the

850
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,100
 fourth april of the fourth year of the pandemic no it's

851
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,380
 fourth of april is eas sunday because sometimes the clocks go back in the

852
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,580
 middle and that makes it slightly more complicated for me on account for the

853
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,420
 clocks do not change here um i probably will like

854
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,820
 if it's going to be 50 quid then like the only rational thing i think for me to do

855
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,940
 is to go okay in which case i'm going to do it i'm going to timeshift for a few

856
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,900
 days like i don't think i want to pay 50 quid

857
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,460
 for a thing where i sort of drop in and out and you know get to see

858
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,260
 roughly half the convention none of the parties i think i'm going to have to

859
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,460
 fully timeshift so let's see i mean if it turns out that i also can't go outside

860
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,420
 then that is a much more appealing prospect

861
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:33,020
 yeah then voluntarily staying indoors they've also not talked about

862
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,860
 day memberships but conzeland didn't have day memberships

863
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,300
 punctuation isn't having day memberships because a day membership would do two

864
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,380
 pounds 50 and that's just dense no we we are having day memberships they

865
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,860
 just cost the same as the weekend and give you a free extra day

866
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,260
 yes so conzeland didn't have day memberships i think

867
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,780
 because a lot of stuff for conzeland got sped up

868
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,100
 quite fast in a world where there wasn't really time to think hard about these

869
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,220
 sorts of things but easter con could have day memberships

870
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:08,060
 and i feel like that's something they should be talking about because i think

871
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:13,900
 liz may have said in chat that you wanted a two-day convention really

872
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,980
 rather than four full days of front of frolics and i think there are quite a

873
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,980
 lot of people who might like just one or two days of an easter con rather than

874
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:26,620
 the entire four-day thing yeah it's more that i i think i i mean i very much

875
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,580
 enjoy having four or five full days of frolics at easter con than

876
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,860
 will cons but i'm not sure i actually want to have four

877
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,860
 full days of what is effectively mostly sitting

878
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,780
 with my laptop open on discord and zoom and maybe streaming some twitch to the

879
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,220
 tv if they can go up with some way that i can sort of be engaged with the

880
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,820
 convention but also out and about a bit which i think is one of our aims

881
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,860
 of punctuation we're going to try and do something like that i think that makes

882
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,900
 it more appealing but even if there is a sort of hybrid

883
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,940
 well we're going to have meetups in these places with as many people as

884
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,540
 possible like obviously that's not much use to me

885
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,820
 as possibly the only easter con fan yeah you and Pete's family yeah it would be

886
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,860
 me and me and Pete's family who are in fact

887
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:14,460
 yeah who are in fact two hours away so yeah no so i think it's going to be

888
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,980
 interesting because obviously like there is a question as well as to whether or

889
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,860
 not it makes sense to offer day memberships because i

890
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,420
 assume most of their costs are going to be super like

891
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,860
 not it's going to be based on total people rather than like how many people

892
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,900
 you have at once so like i don't know to what extent they're going to be able to

893
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,140
 do that but like it's something they could definitely look at

894
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,100
 and like hopefully hopefully they can make all that work i mean

895
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:41,900
 i am planning to go with bells on um i'm very i'm like happy that they're doing

896
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,460
 it and like i say i haven't i haven't missed an easter conces so i started

897
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,300
 going um so like yeah i'm not gonna start now um

898
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,980
 but i am hoping that it will be great and like i think it is important to say

899
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,140
 that although for all of the like you know

900
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,980
 probably not gossiping smoughing cob running doesn't sound right because it

901
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,100
 sounds like you're actually doing it smoughing does sound much more like

902
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,380
 carping carping carping i mean it's it's like

903
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:11,420
 we're a podcast about fandom we're going to complain about the easter color

904
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,260
 we that's kind of what we're here for but we are all of course obviously

905
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,580
 rooting for the easter con we all uh definitely want it to be great

906
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:25,340
 oh yeah even if we can't root at the easter con anyway

907
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,020
 ha ha that's for our Australian listeners i assume that's for our

908
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,820
 Australian listeners anyway are you familiar with the word rooting

909
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:36,620
 Liz no it's Australian for f*cking oh okay

910
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:41,340
 but they still call their Wi-Fi routers routers and that makes me so happy

911
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:46,540
 is this something you learned on your guff trip it's Australian slang for

912
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:50,860
 not practicing careful social distancing

913
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:54,700
 is there anything else we want to say about easter con um

914
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,540
 i mean i as well as asking the easter con committee for a budget i would also

915
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:03,500
 like them to be thinking hard about compelling social spaces i'm sure they

916
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,340
 will be anyway i think the announcement they um

917
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,300
 released made it seem like they weren't of the opinion that this was a solved

918
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,260
 problem whether or not that means that they will have a compelling

919
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,380
 solution is obviously like slightly different but like i'm hoping the fact

920
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,140
 that they don't think is a solved problem indicates that they are

921
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,860
 kind of thinking of our how to you know improve um

922
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,780
 upon the current situation so so i'm kind of like cautiously optimistic

923
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,700
 that that is um i think that's happening

924
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:44,700
 upcoming conventions so um upcoming conventions fire fire the magazine

925
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,260
 uh that george ron martin can't pronounce uh is running a convention

926
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,420
 uh that is next weekend and at the time of writing everything except for

927
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,460
 the friday assault out by the time you hear this almost certainly the whole

928
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,820
 thing will be sold out but uh congratulations congratulations to them

929
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,340
 on running what looks like a great convention and hopefully it'll be brilliant

930
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:08,300
 for everyone who's going and um finland the all and islands are bidding

931
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:13,420
 for the 2025 euro con which is all very exciting

932
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:17,260
 um that might be in a country that doesn't have any coronavirus in 2025 so

933
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:23,500
 like that's gotta be good right and then um i wish you i should say i went to the

934
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,780
 2015 archipelago and this would be archipelago 2

935
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,780
 and it was great although it's very easy to stay up drinking till 2 a.m

936
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,740
 when it doesn't really get dark at night so a recommendation and a warning

937
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,580
 whereas of course if it does get dark at night it's very difficult to stay out

938
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,780
 drinking till 2 a.m

939
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:52,620
 we also have a note in the show notes that by the time we record the euro con in

940
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:56,460
 2022 will have been decided but i can't find anything about it

941
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,380
 during my quick googles on the internet so listeners if you know

942
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,700
 where the 2022 euro con is going to be please write us a letter of comment

943
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,620
 so we can be more informed next time

944
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:16,700
 we maybe we should talk about punctuation remind people it's still good we're

945
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:21,180
 still doing that guys right um so john here i'm recording a quick

946
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,460
 pickup because liz asked whether we were going to mention punctuation

947
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:29,020
 and then me and Arson agreed but immediately got distracted

948
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:34,300
 and then we didn't end up mentioning it in the podcast so i'm rectifying that now

949
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,980
 punctuation is a convention you can join for five pounds you can join today

950
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,820
 and it's happening at the 13th to the 15th of november 2020

951
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:46,780
 we would be very keen to see everyone who listens to oak to the up come along

952
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,220
 um we are super hopeful and super enthusiastic about some of the stuff

953
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:56,140
 we've got planned um and we are very much looking forward to welcoming you all

954
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:03,100
 to our idea of an online convention so head on over to punctuation con.uk

955
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,300
 and join now

956
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:16,380
 that was the 16th episode of the octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me

957
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,940
 and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me the theme music for this episode

958
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,340

960
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:46,940
 anyway welcome to octa thought the podcast about the movie serenity um

961
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,100
 very topical i was told that you could watch serenity without having watched

962
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,020
 far flight and i believe this to be not true i met someone no no

963
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,580
 alice said i said you are going to blow your i'm going to blow you right now

964
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:02,380
 right i met someone at my 30th birthday party i was in the bar and um

965
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,100
 someone was like oh you're having a birthday party like you know

966
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,900
 and started a conversation back in the days when there were bars you could talk

967
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,700
 to people less than two years apart you didn't know

968
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,340
 and he was like oh you know like he was here and i was like oh there you know

969
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,300
 they're french for university when i was at the university i was an engineer and i was

970
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,260
 like brilliant so i was like who's there i was like ah there french

971
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,780
 science fiction you went ah quite like sci-fi uh one of my favorite movies is

972
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,580
 that movie serenity have you seen that and i was like yeah and he went yeah i

973
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,060
 really wish that it was a sequel and he said and i said well obviously you've got

974
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:32,620
 firefly and he said what's firefly and i said sir you are about to have a very

975
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,460
 good week because i'm going to tell you a thing that is going to make your day

976
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,900
 and i told him that serenity was the follow-up to a series show called firefly

977
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:45,100
 and he was like what and i was like i have just i have just done such a good

978
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:49,180
 deed definitely getting into heaven now okay i i had not seen

979
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,500
 firefly when i watched serenity and i thought it was

980
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,140
 incomprehensible um and not at all good so imagine how excited you'd be about

981
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,340
 firefly if you'd enjoyed serenity yeah i think that's the issue actually

982
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:03,340
 because it's never occurred to me to go watch firefly though you know

983
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,660
 maybe one day when i get to the bottom of my television backlog

984
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,580
 queue i mean i will be honest i went back and rewatch firefly

985
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,940
 and there are some ways in which it has not aged well

986
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,940
 especially the first pilot rewatching it it is slow and it does take a

987
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,820
 long time to induce the characters and it is a little bit

988
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,980
 it takes us up a little bit too seriously and actually and don't tell any firefly

989
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,020
 fans i said this i think fox might have been right to make him

990
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,980
 shoot a different first episode because i think the train job works better as

991
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,020
 an introduction to the characters because it does everything in subtext

992
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,860
 instead of like as explicit exposition and i think show don't tell

993
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:44,620
 is a is a thing that's good um but i would recommend it because he's very good

994
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:49,660
 well this is certainly a change from our usual mcu based movie chat

995
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,260
 yeah now that we're discussing movies for 15 years ago so that's good

996
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:57,340
 uh well this is the after show sorted we're just going backwards in time

997
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,820
 that's because i have watched no mcu movies in the last fortnight

998
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:06,620
 you know next week 12 monkeys right oh yes 12 monkeys because it's all right

999
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,980
 player yeah 12 monkeys a movie i have no particular

1000
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:15,340
 desire to watch right now for some reason i do like it i do love it

1001
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:19,260
 are you saying you don't want to watch depressing apocalyptic movies

1002
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:25,180
 in which time doesn't seem to have any meaning i i love 12 monkeys i i mean i

1003
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,700
 quite like the the weird french short on which it's

1004
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:33,500
 based but i um i really like 12 monkeys i really like the fact that it's

1005
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,420
 uh hugely successful big budget hollywood film with

1006
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,900
 that nevertheless has quite a lot intelligent to say about its topic

1007
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:47,180
