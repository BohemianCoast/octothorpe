 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 46th episode of OctaThorp, a podcast for Science

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:26,560
 Fiction and Science Fiction fandom. This episode is coming to you on the 9th of December 2021.

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,440
 I'm John Gogson. I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty. And I think this might be our first three

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:44,240
 country podcast. Possibly. Because I am in Portugal. I have never been to Portugal before. Portugal

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,640
 is very nice. I've mostly seen the inside of a hotel because that's the way it works. But I've

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,120
 seen Portugal a bit and I've had some very good meals. Somebody led us, somebody basically took us

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,080
 into a restaurant where they had to, we all had to get into the restaurant, show our vaccination

8
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,040
 status or recent lateral flow tests. And it was the most science fiction experience I've had for a

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,600
 little while, not necessarily in a great way. But then they served us very large chunks of cow,

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,040
 apologies to any vegans in the audience. Maybe we need a content warning. But it's been very good.

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:28,560
 And it also, John's app tells me I'm an alcoholic. So for those who, for those who don't know,

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,160
 which I think probably is most of Alice in a ship, except for Claire Brierley of Croydon,

13
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,960
 I have written an app that helps you track your alcohol consumption. And I gave Alison the beta,

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,600
 the day that she went to a convention, because I am what is technically referred to as a

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,240
 bad friend. As a result of having an app that tracks your alcohol consumption,

16
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,320
 I know that when I sit up late in the bar and say, I sat up very late in the bar, but I didn't

17
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,200
 really drink all that much. I was mostly just chatting and drinking water. That is what is

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,360
 technically known as a lie. And so far, I've had the app for two days, but I've now had three

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,200
 consecutive days where I have drunk more than the UK government's recommended weekly intake of

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,600
 alcohol on each of the three days. So I'm slightly worried about that, but not very,

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,640
 because it will wear off next week and then there's Christmas Odea.

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,000
 Yeah, I had a similar experience at Corflour and Overcon where I was like, oh, that's how much I

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
 drink at a convention. Well, golly. It's a good app. It will be out of the

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,800
 through at some point. And we'll, yeah, we'll definitely plug it. But it's good for you.

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,080
 But it wasn't helped by the fact that James Bacon, who is one of the chairs of this convention,

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,560
 has been playing me quite a lot. So he, there was a lot of port and I like port a lot. There

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,120
 was port and cheese that I really, honestly, well, you are in port, you go. I am in Portugal. And

28
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,360
 it is the local, I have to sample the local delicacies, which in this case is port. And when we ran out,

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,200
 we we drank the hotel out of cheap, cheap Ruby port. So then we drank quite a bit of white port.

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:15,520
 Oh, go. And then there's been some shenanigans with the surplus from W and 2019 as well. Irish

31
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:22,320
 Bon amilla, they can call it infansines. So Swafcon is great. It's been ground at us. Yeah.

32
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,960
 John, does your app have any social features so that you can wander around and

33
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,880
 used to come bar and know what everyone else, how much everyone else has been drinking as well?

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,080
 No, it does not. Because that is, I think, what would be called a privacy nightmare.

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,360
 Oh, well, we've got some taps anyway, don't we?

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,200
 So I went to Swafcon, by which I mean, I was on a panel. I did not actually attend any of the kind

37
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,440
 of convention. I just appeared on a panel as a sort of informed person, which is a bit weird.

38
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:05,040
 What were you informed about? I was informed about the role of publications. The people who

39
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,480
 are listening to this may know I have opinions about, from my opinions about them in previous

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,320
 episodes. But basically it was me and Case Van Tawne and Marcin Clack and Sarah Felix,

41
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,000
 who moderated. And we had a jolly good discussion in which I think I was the person most in favor

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,920
 of electronic things on the panel because Marcin is quite a big fan of physical artifacts.

43
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,560
 And Case is also kind of a big fan of printing things out. But I think it was a good panel.

44
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,360
 And Sarah, I think Sarah is less of a fan of printing things out, but she is a very great fan

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,080
 of having all of the previous work lined up beyond her bookshelves so that she can get design

46
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,880
 inspiration from things that people have done before. So I feel like you were the,

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,080
 yeah, you were definitely the most pro-electronic of the people on the panel. And it was a good panel.

48
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,040
 I've been on a panel about overworking at conventions, which was sparsely attended. And that's because

49
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,280
 there are about 50 people in here in person. And then there's more people online obviously,

50
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,200
 but there are often four streams running simultaneously. And I'm here to say publicly,

51
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,360
 SMOFCON, that is too many streams, even if you are a "program heavy convention." You should be

52
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,840
 having fewer better program items. I know that I say this to all the conventions except Corflum,

53
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,080
 which only have five program items. But Corflum and SMOFCON are not dissimilar in size,

54
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,520
 and SMOFCON has 10 times as much program as Corflum did. And the ideal amounts of program

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,680
 is almost certainly somewhere between those two, even if you're quite a program heavy

56
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,560
 convention, because we did a perfectly good panel to a room of about four people.

57
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,200
 Just to say, it would be difficult to advise Corflum to have smaller, better program, because

58
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,560
 Corflum had about three program items, and two of those were meals.

59
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,760
 Also, how much has SMOFCON been affected by travel difficulties? I mean, how many people

60
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,280
 had to drop out last minute, because I saw quite a few. Oh, lots. And they lost quite a few last

61
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,040
 week. I mean, so one of the things that's been very interesting about SMOFCON is that

62
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,800
 over the course of this weekend, everybody's return travel arrangements have been disrupted

63
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,160
 by change testing requirements in the country that they are flying to when they fly home.

64
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,840
 Almost everyone I know in the UK has texted me in the last 24 hours to say, "When are you returning?"

65
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,560
 Because, "Did you know that?" And I'm like, "Yes, I did know that. I am returning four hours and

66
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,600
 20 minutes before the requirement for a pretest comes into force." So hopefully, unless we're

67
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,280
 very, very late, we will not have to have a lot of flow test at the airport. We will just have

68
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,720
 PCR so we'll get there. So the other thing I wanted to say about SMOFCON is that it's a really

69
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:48,480
 good example about a convention that's had to take very careful account of the need to keep

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:56,560
 all of its members safe, because there are a lot of strains of worldcon at this convention.

71
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,600
 And if you're not very careful, you're likely to catch one, including Margarit Smith, who was,

72
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,840
 I guess, last time, who has spent quite a lot of the weekend going for 17 weeks. Mary Robin

73
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,560
 Eckhole came on to the, came on and gave us a presentation about DISCON in which she said,

74
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,760
 "This convention is cursed and we are giving it an exorcism, so you should all have protective

75
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,480
 amulets to help DISCON. But there are many strains of worldcon circulating. There is a

76
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,720
 particularly virulent Glasgow in 2024 strain, which many of the people here are infected with."

77
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,360
 I recommend social distancing for avoiding infection with Worldcon. Just don't go anywhere

78
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,920
 near anyone who's got it. I'm lucky in that I have some residual immunity from London in 2014.

79
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,320
 This has not quite worn off completely yet. So that's why you're only working on one Worldcon?

80
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,040
 I'm only working and I'm only very, very slightly working on Glasgow, that's right.

81
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,560
 So that's why third convention is six weeks, which is very strange. I had a notion of what SMOFCON

82
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,960
 would be like. I've never been to a SMOFCON in person. I'm that SMOFCON, as regular root listeners

83
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,480
 were low because of the auspices of Dublin in 2019, which decided to use some of its surplus

84
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,880
 to encourage con runners from around the world to come to SMOFCON. The average age of the

85
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,280
 SMOFCON crowd is about half what I was expecting. And there are a lot of fans from around Europe

86
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,960
 who are talking about their conventions in their area, are talking about what they're doing locally.

87
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,560
 I have plans to maybe run a year ago on. It's just a much younger and more diverse crowd than I was

88
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
 expecting it to be and it's been great.

89
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:42,240
 Our sponsor for OctaThorp is once again Stowe shirts, reminding you that you can just about

90
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,680
 get shirts for Christmas as long as you choose rush shipping. Our chapter art features listener

91
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,880
 Gwen wearing the spaceman from the punctuation logo by Sue Mason. Gwen says this is her favourite

92
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,600
 sweatshirt and people are always asking her where she got it. It turns out it's not a secret. You

93
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,160
 can get it and many more lovely things from the OctaThorp shop at octaThorp.stoweshirts.com.

94
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,640
 I'm actually wearing this sweatshirt right now and it is extremely comfortable and very nappy.

95
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,680
 Use code OctaThorp for a 10% discount. Thank you to Gwen for letting us use her photo and thank you

96
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
 to Stoweshirts for sponsoring the podcast.

97
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,520
 We held off on discussing World Fantasy Con's single COVID case because we were at Nova Con and

98
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,320
 we didn't know how Nova Con would interact with COVID and it turned out that Nova Con interacted

99
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:47,120
 with COVID. Enthusiastically I would say. So Liz as our resident biology person and COVID expert.

100
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,960
 Nova Con, so Nova Con wasn't a convention that happened and I was not there. The two of you were,

101
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,200
 the reports seem to be quite good about you know everyone was vaccinated. Lots of people did tests

102
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,360
 before they went. A lot of mask wearing. Okay no everyone was not vaccinated. Let's be clear here.

103
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,240
 Everyone was asked to be vaccinated but nobody checked anything. Yeah this is a major problem I think

104
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,960
 in the strategy is it was very much done on the honor system. So what we know is that

105
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,480
 after Nova Con there were I think eight or nine people that we know of who had positive tests

106
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,760
 and it's plausible based on the timeframe that they were infected at Nova Con and given that

107
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,840
 sort of cluster around a single event it does seem quite plausible that the infection did happen

108
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,880
 at Nova Con. Yeah which is obviously not a great outcome for your for your convention.

109
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,240
 And there were also a couple of people at Nova Con who were definitely showing symptoms which

110
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,080
 showed compatible with COVID. Those people were testing negative regularly. I think this is really

111
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,240
 important to stress that the people, a lot of people were testing negative all the way through

112
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,960
 the convention and yeah I mean I think that it's won't just stress but my general feelings on

113
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,400
 lateral flow tests are they catch the people who are most infectious and we don't really know any

114
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,520
 like chains of infection here. We can say it seems like these people were probably infected at Nova Con

115
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,640
 but we don't know how, we don't know if it was another 10-day at Nova Con, we don't know if it was

116
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,840
 you know anyone else they met while they were at Nova Con or while out in Nottingham.

117
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,720
 Buxton. Okay it was in Buxton this time. I don't know I didn't go. They're all the same.

118
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,200
 I was and I'm working on a fancy an article about this but I am of the opinion that the

119
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,400
 they had said that people should have the NHS COVID pass before arriving which obviously means

120
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:48,000
 that either you've had two doses of the vaccine or you've tested negative on APCR or you've tested

121
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,600
 negative on an LFT within some time frame and we'll put a link in the show notes so that

122
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,160
 eager listeners can go and read more about that. I do think it's become clear especially

123
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,520
 in the last month like since Nova Con that two doses of the vaccine does not actually necessarily

124
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,600
 give you as good an immunity as we would like and this is why we're currently having a large

125
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 discussion about boosters and things like that and I do wonder whether the next conventions

126
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:23,200
 to run kind of post boosters and Omocron may need to consider whether or not they want to

127
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,680
 mandate negative tests and vaccination rather than either or. For instance I've had both

128
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,560
 Jabs of the vaccine but my last dose was in July and I don't know what that means from my immunity

129
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,320
 at Novocron whereas Alison had had her third jab like two weeks before Novocron and so was probably

130
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,680
 at a lot less at risk than I was. Now obviously I'm a lot younger so like I wasn't particularly

131
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,080
 worried on a personal level but yeah I just I do wonder whether what we had been saying kind of

132
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,960
 before the convention season started maybe that was a bit too simplistic and maybe we need to be

133
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,400
 looking at mandating negative tests and vaccinations rather than rather than doing all

134
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,800
 the same but I don't know. I think Eastercom's thinking about this. I am also slightly concerned

135
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,120
 that there's a model that seems to be standard for events where we say oh well when we're actually

136
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,920
 in the like the program rooms everyone will be masked and we will have social distancing and

137
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,200
 ventilation and obviously people will take off the masks when they're eating and drinking

138
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:37,440
 in an assumption that people eat and drink in kind of small contained groups of their personal friends

139
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:46,560
 and then you get people like me and I don't think I'm alone here who go oh Novocron how many people do

140
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,480
 I know who will be at Novocron? 171. How many of those can I realistically have an in-depth

141
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,560
 conversation with over a drink over the course of a weekend? I think we have a word for people

142
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,840
 like me and I think that's also true at things like smofkong. So if you have a lot of people who's

143
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,960
 purpose in going to a convention is to talk to as many of their friends in

144
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,400
 conversation in lengthy conversations as possible I think that does make it quite hard

145
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:25,840
 even with vaccinations and negative tests and social distancing and aeration I think there is

146
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,080
 only so much that you could do. I think the other thing I will say is there are a couple of things

147
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,280
 I think Novocron did which I don't think helped and then there was one thing I think that we could

148
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,640
 do as a community which I think would help which is starting with the community one. I think if you

149
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,960
 are in the bar and not drinking I think we do need to normalise mask wearing kind of even in

150
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,440
 kind of static social groups. I mean and I speak as someone who has trouble hearing people speaking

151
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,880
 through masks I do appreciate it makes conversations harder and I don't like it but I do like covid

152
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,760
 less so on balance I think I do think I was I was wearing my mask when I didn't have a point in

153
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,320
 front of me and trying to try to make sure that I was doing that. The other thing Novocron did that

154
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,800
 I think may have been unhelpful was they did have several program items which were everyone come to

155
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:20,560
 this giant room and drinking in in it for a while and I'm not sure like whether or not that was good

156
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,560
 practice necessarily it was very fun but I just I wonder whether they'd have been better off

157
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,880
 instead of having a big party where there was free wine in the program room saying oh we've put

158
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,200
 some money behind each of the bars and you can just kind of wander up and get a drink with like a

159
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,160
 token that you found in your membership pack or something instead because it was fun but I did

160
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,080
 think at the time is this actually a sensible program item to have at the moment and I do wonder

161
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,480
 whether the answer was no but. Smofcon also has programs of this kind but I think the other thing

162
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,240
 about Smofcon is it's a very small convention again and I think being physically a smaller

163
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,840
 convention makes all of this much better still we are still probably rolling in a bucket of each

164
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,680
 other's germs though portable much safer in lots of ways big airy bar rather than small comfortable

165
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,560
 badly ventilated bar that sort of thing. I think the thing is you can never make anything you can't

166
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:22,080
 make anything 100% safe and if we had this level of non-COVID-con crud after a Nova-con then we wouldn't

167
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,840
 find it particularly remarkable although I appreciate that that generally a non-COVID-con crud doesn't

168
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,800
 have people feeling quite as bad as some people did after catching COVID but I think I think you're

169
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,280
 right I mean I think we have to say okay well we can't be 100% safe but how can we make this safer

170
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,520
 and you know you have to base this on what the kind of environment is at the time but I think you're

171
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,000
 right in that maybe we do need to try and drop the culture where everyone sort of sits around with

172
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,040
 a pint in a closed room and you are continually kind of drinking your pint without your mask on

173
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,480
 and say okay if we're going to have a really young conversation maybe we're better if we went

174
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,720
 somewhere quiet where we can sit like a meter and a half apart and keep our masks on and have a really

175
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:06,560
 long conversation like maybe there is our different models of socializing we should be doing I appreciate

176
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,360
 that you know in many ways might make things less fun and it might mean that the convention is not

177
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,280
 fun enough for people to want to go in some cases but I think there probably are ways we could make

178
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,600
 it slightly slightly better it's also it's very difficult in November it's going to be it'd be a

179
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,840
 lot better if you're in June you could actually say right well let's go and like you know sort of

180
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,040
 bench outside and have a natter and that kind of thing but you you can't do that sometimes we

181
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:39,360
 spent quite a lot of time at Bristol either outside or in extremely drafty pub environments

182
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:47,120
 so nearly all of the weekend was spent in quite drafty spaces and then Buxton one week later I

183
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,000
 think we got to the Cheshire cheese or Saturday lunchtime took one look at the outside tables and went

184
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,360
 oh no we we there is no point avoiding Covid if we catch pneumonia through other routes I am very

185
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,160
 different from Alison in this regard in that I went out for my birthday last year and it was

186
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,920
 about -2 outside and I just wore three jumpers and so outside I have been very much of the

187
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,640
 opposite opinion which is I would much rather need to warm up when I get home than catch Covid

188
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,320
 yeah you're much less likely to catch pneumonia than me it's much less likely possibly but I

189
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,760
 have bought I have now bought some long johns and some merino wool socks I think and I think

190
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,320
 something I wanted to bring up is that well fantasy calm had one case despite being much

191
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,680
 bigger than over conned despite having a lot of people from disparate places going which I think

192
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,400
 is probably because they had a lot more negative tests kind of en route and so I'm wondering whether

193
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,360
 having a stronger requirement for negative tests and not just relying on vaccine status would make

194
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,800
 British convention safer and I'm not saying you can make them completely safe but I am saying that

195
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,880
 I don't think we have achieved the best safety to compromise ratio we can I think there are small

196
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,800
 compromises we can make to increase safety that are probably still worth making but yeah I am

197
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,840
 actually not sure world fantasy was that much bigger than over conned this year oh interesting

198
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,480
 I did go and I mean I I went and fished out I took on fish at the membership list at some point

199
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,200
 take a look at this but no overcome was unusually big and I think world fantasy was unusually small

200
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,920
 and possibly that is partly because it is quite difficult to get into Canada at the moment for

201
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,840
 instance I would not have been able to attend world fantasy but I could have attended no we can't

202
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:35,200
 I think also the US conventional spaces are much larger generally you know that the

203
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,920
 Bucks of Palace Hotel was very nice but it was not hugely spacious so there were things like

204
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,720
 corridors and and comfortable badly ventilated bars and things like that and we could probably

205
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,080
 have done more I'm on a program item later about hybrid conventions and one of the things I've

206
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,240
 been talking about is designing social spaces and the way that we need to we need to be thinking

207
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,320
 more about how we're designing our social spaces and our social interactions for in-person

208
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,160
 conventions at the moment than we have been for for this exact reason because I probably shouldn't

209
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,640
 be allowed to spend any time on masks in that library bar that I spent the whole year before

210
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,560
 we can't do I mean I should say I did tell any symptoms didn't catch Covid I was quite lucky

211
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,120
 yeah I mean I think that's it ultimately we could have you know you could have tried to require like

212
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,360
 proof of a negative pre-arrival PCR test but in the end it's kind of incremental

213
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:35,200
 things that may not lead you to definitely prevent an outbreak so Nicholas who had the most severe of

214
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,760
 the Levcocock cases is very much of the view that he was 100% going to catch this thing at some point

215
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,000
 and he might as well have some fun while doing it and I definitely I'm clearly way over towards

216
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,720
 the Nicholas end of the scale here you know but the thing is that like as a direct result of that

217
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,840
 attitude as spaniel now doesn't want to go to Isakom and so it's all very well for the people

218
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,640
 whose risk level is such that that's a fine statement for them but they're pushing people out of the

219
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,400
 community and if we can make small compromises that keep those people in the community we should do

220
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,440
 that and I don't think that saying yeah no I'm happy with that and Phil Dyson is looking really

221
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,720
 closely at what they can do what they can legally do what they can practically do and what the

222
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,240
 community will tolerate in terms of what they're going to say for for Eastergone I would be 100%

223
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,120
 happy to have them say you cannot enter this convention unless you have your vax you have your

224
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,200
 booster and all you have a thing saying medical a medical a medical or exceptional exemption and

225
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,800
 you show a negative of 48 hour negative test like like is that's what's going on here I mean

226
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,160
 I know that everyone at the convention I've had here is vaccinated and has has had a recent

227
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,640
 negative test because that's what you need to show to get into Portugal yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

228
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,040
 yeah and I mean I would say like I just want to say that I mean I think when Nicholas saying you

229
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,600
 know he's a bad take that risk what he means is he's prepared to go to conventions but I think

230
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,720
 Nicholas saying like he's going to get at some point and so you know I don't think that means

231
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,680
 anything made the convention less safe or the attitude makes it less safe it's just a

232
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,640
 difference between am I willing to go to conventions knowing there is a risk or not go

233
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,480
 not talking about Nicholas necessarily here it comes back to what you said earlier is about like

234
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,600
 we can never make it completely safe and I agree that's true but I think that attitude used to

235
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,960
 prevent trying is is spania doesn't listen to octa though anymore because she finds our

236
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,840
 discussions about covert two stressful because she doesn't think we're taking it seriously

237
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,320
 enough and I think part of this is because I and I think one of the things I'm coming around to is

238
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,800
 it's not academic it's a real thing it's it's not like a hypothetical that we can discuss in a

239
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:57,040
 scientific context which is devoid from considerations of personal safety and fear I very much get

240
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,520
 frustrated with the I think we do if there are steps that we can be taking to make conventions

241
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,720
 safer which are not like super owners like I don't know making everyone LFT on the door hello

242
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,960
 why aren't we making everyone last you on the door John I think we should actually make hello

243
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,600
 and LFT on the door I'd be up that is that I'd be up for that 100% well like I mean like I don't

244
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,160
 think we could have like the LFTs in the lobby but I'd like I'll tell you what I said like I'd

245
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,160
 like all the hotel staff to wear a mask all the time while they're working thank you very much

246
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,280
 yes that would be good I need to get more water because it's a very very very dry hotel on the

247
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,560
 back of just a sec I mean I think actually the yeah if you made people literally taken LFT at the

248
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,440
 entry of the hotel when they came in on day one that actually might be a quite effective thing to

249
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,920
 do because it removes any uncertainty about I know or maybe you know maybe you have to do that if

250
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,480
 you don't have like a negative PCR test from the last 24 hours or something because that would

251
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,880
 probably be more effective at catching infectious people it's impossible to evade and it probably

252
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:10,800
 like gets people right as they appear I also I've got an anxiety thing apparently I didn't realize

253
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,320
 but it took because I'm quite face blind anyway so so one of the things that happened this weekend

254
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,920
 is the people I have known for many years and seen many times I failed to recognize because they're

255
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,840
 wearing masks and it's been it's been quite difficult so there's that I mean and you can

256
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:35,600
 get you're dazed to the social I would say it is definitely true that like as someone who does

257
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,120
 sometimes struggle to kind of hear people sorry it is harder to keep up with conversations where

258
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,640
 people are wearing masks in the bar I have I have been trying because you do that thing and I suspect

259
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,760
 many people do this but like where you you say what like twice and then you feel awkward

260
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,400
 continuing to say what but I've been trying to be like I've been trying to explain to people like

261
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,920
 I can't hear you it's tricky these are all considerations I should say and I know I said I

262
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,960
 wouldn't be at the Easter Car I will be at Easter Car and one of the reasons I'll be at Easter Car is

263
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,720
 that I am bidding for the 2023 Easter Car and a core part of the 2023 bid is the contention that

264
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,640
 some people no matter what we do for COVID management and making the convention safer for people some

265
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:31,040
 people will prefer not to come to a physical Easter Car in 2023 and so we need to be designing

266
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:37,600
 an Easter Car from the ground up that has both online and in-person elements and that is so

267
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,640
 that we are not what I think the thing that John said was driving people away from the community

268
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,160
 we are hoping to have people in the community in a variety of different routes and I think that's

269
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,600
 really important because there may not be an Easter Car that both España and I are happy to attend

270
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,400
 and this was something that came up on a panel at Nova Carne like one of the panelists at Nova Carne

271
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,240
 made some disparaging remark about how like zoom is like very privileged and like by relying on

272
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,400
 zoom we're like pushing people out and I was like yeah but all of the healthy people getting

273
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,880
 together in a room is also very privileged it's just a different privilege like it's there's I think

274
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,800
 I think using as many streams as you can also I'm here to say this on Opti-Thought I'm reasonably

275
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,400
 certain I can get you on to zoom using crap I have lying around my house and if you're listening to

276
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,640
 this and you cannot use zoom because of a lack of access to technology you need to get in touch

277
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,760
 I will sort you out so that you can get on zoom if you haven't got the internet then that's

278
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,520
 a problem but if you haven't got the internet I don't see the internet listening to Opti-Thought

279
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,400
 No I think our listeners probably have a certain amount of technical privilege vested in them

280
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,280
 I do like you know print out a copy of what you know will print out copies of Opti-Thought

281
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,880
 and put them in the post for you if you'd like it will just be like a print out of the WAV file

282
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,680
 so it might not be very easy to understand well Chris Garcia who will be listening to this

283
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,840
 episode hi Chris did do a podcast that he recorded on cassette tapes so Chris if you want to bootleg

284
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,200
 this podcast onto cassette tapes and send them to John Hertz we would be very happy for you to do

285
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,320
 that um have we have we worked through kovit do we have lost thoughts on kovit at conventions

286
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,880
 for the moment they'll be more unsure John can you trim that down so because I'm pretty sure we

287
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,320
 said most of that like before and I'm not sure it's oh no I thought we took it I thought the stuff

288
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,240
 about actually getting into the where some people's boundaries are I think is really good and new

289
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,560
 but it might be quite hard to edit it will be difficult to edit just because it will be difficult

290
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,480
 to listen back to I will keep that sentence in the podcast because it is hard to talk about this

291
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:50,640
 stuff like it genuinely is scary it's scary to put it it's scary to have to define and defend your

292
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,720
 boundaries you know this is a very new situation we find ourselves in where we suddenly all have

293
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,480
 this this very big thing in our lives that we all have very different boundaries to and we have to

294
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,880
 I think it is difficult to talk about these things because it's a thing we don't often have to talk

295
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:13,680
 about we don't have to talk about like how we are comfortable and think about why and it's it's

296
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,840
 hard it's hard to talk about it makes me very anxious to talk about it but I hope it's useful for

297
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,080
 people listening to hear different people's takes so I hope it was good even if it's stressful

298
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,360
 yeah just stressful then I think I find it less stressful because I can view it in a more academic

299
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,080
 way and also because I'm aware there's like I don't know lots of diseases to my catch um that's

300
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,680
 what we are all about you know I'm in a position where one of my close friends from uni is dealing

301
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:55,680
 with chemotherapy failing and my mother has dementia and I feel like we did have 10 cases of covid

302
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:02,320
 but there all everyone there is fine and we may at this point be getting to the stage where we are

303
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:10,880
 over people are being overly worried about things that are actually not as likely to kill them or

304
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,880
 severely limit their lives as the other terrible things that we all have to deal with every day

305
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:27,200
 and and we need to live our lives and that that is and I'm not by any means advocating massive

306
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:35,840
 risk taking here so listeners may not know I have anxiety and one of the things that I found

307
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,120
 I had a very anxious reaction to having a bad concussion at work a couple of years ago because

308
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,840
 I was very worried that like basically I was going to have a stroke and die and most of my anxieties

309
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,800
 do revolve around kind of things that would be life ending uh mostly professionally but but

310
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,040
 sometimes in a health context so it doesn't normally manifest as hypochondria but but the concussion

311
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:06,400
 really did a number on me and it is terrifying it was very scary when I was like still having

312
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,440
 concussion symptoms like three weeks later because I was like this is not I don't like this I don't

313
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,120
 like the idea that my brain could be doing things it's not supposed to be doing and in some ways it

314
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,520
 really did and I think this goes a little bit to what Alison was just experiencing it really did

315
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,440
 help me with some other things I've been having anxiety about like realize like yes but being

316
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,880
 afraid of literally dying is very different to being afraid to like having a paper come back

317
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:41,120
 with bad comments and it really did recontextualize some stuff kind of that I had been worrying about

318
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:48,160
 and so I do take the point that like we do need to be careful that we don't overcorrect in a way

319
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:56,640
 that basically means that that we're not kind of carping the DM as it were I mean I had two things

320
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,240
 one is I was I'm curious as to how job managed to get concussed at work because as far as I knew

321
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,880
 your job most evolved sitting at computers all day and now I'm worrying about how I like get a

322
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,880
 concussion maybe if I fall off my desk chair but I mean I think the other thing is also true in that

323
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,480
 I think COVID is making everyone reevaluate the risks of various things and in fact I think we

324
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,520
 will have a strong reevaluation of things like people used to get concred or the flu or various

325
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,040
 other viruses and we just sort of like accepted that as a thing and maybe in the future we actually

326
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:38,320
 won't accept that as a thing even if COVID is you know mostly you know not an ongoing issue we might

327
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,720
 say well actually maybe we should wear masks when in large situations because it'll stop people

328
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,360
 getting nasty coughs and colds you know I think there's going to be a big reevaluation because I

329
00:31:49,360 --> 00:32:00,400
 think certainly the UK has not been through this kind of multi-year evolving pandemic that most of us

330
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,680
 can remember. So the point I actually wanted to make was a tiny one about anxiety which is I think

331
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,640
 one of the things that you see throughout opto-thorpe which is that John is a very anxious person

332
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,400
 who has treatment for anxiety and I am the person who spent six hours at hospital with

333
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,440
 while I kept going is it okay if I go home now and they went no we really need to do some more

334
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,720
 checking to make sure you haven't had a stroke so people have different risk appetite so I think

335
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,040
 that's probably good. Some of what people's personal risk appetite is also comes off as not

336
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:40,080
 being sufficiently considerate of other people's risk appetites. I think it mostly works one way

337
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,560
 in that people people who are much more concerned about COVID tend to be much more concerned about

338
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,320
 people who are not taking it seriously whereas the people who feel that people are taking it too

339
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,960
 seriously tend to be less bothered because it doesn't make huge differences to them but it might

340
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,720
 if you had things like masking in bars and stuff. I don't think people are I wouldn't say so and

341
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,160
 so is taking it too seriously that's you know what I would say is because I'm worried about

342
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,080
 testing not being very reliable and I might not do two conventions in two weeks again for a very

343
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,520
 long time. Safe as Mofcom you know I've been sitting in the house for a week I could only have got

344
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,440
 over by a macular conception I am not infectious at this convention and that makes me very much

345
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,600
 more comfortable about sitting up till the bar and three o'clock in the morning talking bollocks

346
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,800
 it's because the risk I'm taking is the risk I might catch it not the risk I might spread it

347
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:38,080
 the risk I'm but spread it is much more worrying to me and that's why at Novocorn because it turns

348
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,080
 out it would have been possible for me to catch COVID at Corflu have no symptoms test negative

349
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,760
 cause continually and still have spread it over com I don't think it's very likely but it's clearly

350
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,920
 possible I am actually more worried about that behavior now in retrospect. I will say something I

351
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,600
 did think of and I don't know whether I said it on the podcast or whether I said it in a conversation

352
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,520
 with people like at first Thursday or something was I was like I was a little bit concerned about

353
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,440
 the week between Corflu and Novocorn because I was like if you get pinged in between it will be a bit

354
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,640
 of a tricky thing and I think one of the things COVID is going to do is that kind of will hold

355
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,800
 a convention a week before in the same country so that people can do both is going to get a lot

356
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,200
 trickier because you do have that consideration of well what if there's an outbreak at convention one

357
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,000
 and I do wonder whether that will have an impact on cons kind of for the next couple of years

358
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,080
 so I think that is an interesting thing. Yeah that's interesting should you space them apart so you

359
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,600
 don't end up turning one into a spreader event because the other yeah okay so so there are

360
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,040
 several reasons why people are not at smothcon this weekend but one of the reasons that are

361
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,240
 people are not here is that people who have large jobs on disc on are like oh we would normally fly

362
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,320
 to smothcon two weeks before the world con and we are not doing that because the consequences of

363
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,000
 catching COVID either on route or at the convention are just too great and that's perfectly I think

364
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,040
 that does seem to be like a very sensible risk judgment but there are people who are not here

365
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,360
 in need of expectancy because they have to be fit for disc on and there is one senior member

366
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:17,680
 of the disc on team here and that's what and I'm done are we done with COVID guys yeah I just I

367
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:25,760
 want to tell this how I did my concussion oh god I lent down to get my bag and I hit my head on a shelf

368
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,040
 at speed and I I don't know if I blacked out but my knees certainly gave out and one minute I was

369
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,720
 standing up in the next minute I was sitting down and my colleague looked at me and went what just

370
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,200
 happened I was like hit my head and then I didn't really get symptoms of a concussion for another

371
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,800
 few days and then they stuck around for an enormously long time and I was very worried

372
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
 mostly because they keep saying if you blacked out when you had your concussion it's very

373
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,640
 important you tell us and I was like I don't know if I did I don't remember it well enough and

374
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,680
 many doctors seemed very displeased without answer I've bang my head on many things many

375
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,640
 times I never got a concussion so also like now is my head extremely solid or Liz absolute unit batty

376
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:15,600
 yes we're going to talk about site selection listeners in a ginger style

377
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,200
 palate cleanser from our pretty serious discussion about COVID so I have paid my 50

378
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,040
 dollars site selection fee and I have filled in my site selection PDF and I have emailed it to the

379
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,480
 disc on site selection email address and your deadline to complete all of those steps if you so

380
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,880
 desire is some point on the 14th of December I recommend doing it by the 13th to avoid any time

381
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,200
 zone based shenanigans especially if you're Liz I'm going to suggest that you do it right now you

382
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,880
 are listening to ops thought right now and you should stop what you're doing and sort your site

383
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,400
 selection ballot out this will also give you a supporting membership in the new welcome whether

384
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:05,760
 it is Chengdu Chengdu or Winnipeg and I think it's a good thing to do and it's a bit tedious the

385
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,280
 kind of you know you print out a PDF and you fill it in and you scan it and you email it but

386
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,480
 you have no idea how much better it is than it used to be we kind of go we have to reward

387
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,600
 progress here one day one day Novocod is going to have an electronic hotel booking for it

388
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,560
 note it is a lot better than it was kind of when I entered World Confundum it's still not quite

389
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,400
 perfect but it is a lot better so well done to all involved Liz have you got any thoughts on site

390
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,520
 selection I just haven't done it yet because I have to I mean I don't have a printer or a scanner

391
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,120
 I've won in the office so I'd have to go and use the office one oh so I can't take your photograph

392
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,360
 of it with your phone come on we live in the 21st century yeah but I can't sign it yeah no you

393
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:55,120
 gonna have to print it off yeah I have to print it out to sign it and then take a photo which is

394
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:01,200
 actually like at this point stricter than like when I tried to prove my identity for a bank account

395
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,200
 at this point like I think I should be able to just stick it like an electronic signature on there

396
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,760
 and take a photo of it well what I am actually going to do with this form is I'm going to put it

397
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,120
 onto GoodNotes 5 on my iPad and then I'm going to sign it with my Apple pencil and then I'm going

398
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,120
 to send it to them and if they don't I don't think they'll notice I think they'll be completely

399
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,560
 fine with it I think I think I'm going to throw a file anyway it'll be fine I will try sticking

400
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,720
 in there like my electronic signature on there which is just you know an image of my actual

401
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,960
 signature and send it to them that's why I did tell you what Liz you feel it and add

402
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,520
 send it to me by email and I will sign Liz Batty on it and send it back to you and then you can

403
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,440
 send it in because they don't know what your signature is like this is not in any way an

404
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,720
 actual security thing this is even less secure I'm just right just writing X Liz pretend you

405
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:59,280
 don't know how to do handwriting just put an X on oh right are you going to vote for Winnipeg

406
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,320
 or Chengdu Liz um probably going to vote for Winnipeg I sound very gluey about that I'm not

407
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,760
 actually glue me I think the Winnipeg bid looks pretty good I just think that like the Chengdu

408
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,000
 bid also looks good and the reason I'm not voting for Chengdu is not related to the individuals or

409
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,640
 the like facilities they have accumulated all the Worldcon I think they would be able to run

410
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:28,400
 it's based on whether we should award the Worldcon to China at this moment in time I am much in the

411
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,640
 same boat but in fact Tony from the Chengdu bid has been at smothcon virtually this weekend

412
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,840
 and I've had a number of conversations with swaps where they have been a Chengdu is kind of like the

413
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:51,200
 Austin Texas of China and is very cool place and these are very cool fans and they want to do a

414
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:59,920
 very cool convention but they are in have you nowhere ready to do the Worldcon quite yet in a way that

415
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,160
 is totally different from the conversation about oh we also don't want to give it to China because

416
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,080
 the Chinese government thinks I feel like there is also a bit of oh yes Chengdu but not yet going on

417
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,240
 though this smothcon which is not not where I thought we would be I thought we would be much

418
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,440
 more not Chengdu because China and it's it's not it's not been quite like that one of the things

419
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,320
 that you get at smothcon which is very exciting if you're a total nerd is the detailed answers to the

420
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:32,480
 Spanish Inquisition questions and they are published and they're on the smothcon website and you can

421
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,000
 go read them all for a bit and it is really interesting and the Chengdu responses are very

422
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,280
 quite interesting but I will be voting for Willabeg for those reasons and hopefully the Chinese

423
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,960
 fans will not be too discouraged by this and hopefully the Chinese government will put it

424
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,880
 sacked and what we're gonna have to resolve what we do about that one day. I would say that I think

425
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,480
 that is interesting because from looking through kind of you know the bids um stuff they've submitted

426
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,080
 to Worldcon and their social media and things like to me it looks like you know the Chengdu team

427
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:13,920
 would be able to put on a pretty good Worldcon but it sounds like there is kind of more detail that

428
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,920
 comes out if I would have more conversations with them and you know one reason I haven't done that

429
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,720
 is because I haven't met the team at any conventions because they've been 20. Yes so I'm seeing a bit of

430
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,160
 we think they could probably put on a good convention but they do not yet understand enough about what

431
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,760
 Worldcon's need and are like and we are not sure that they could put on the sort of broad

432
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,160
 generalist science fiction convention at Worldcon is. They could do a different style of convention

433
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,560
 that would certainly be Worldcon. Yes this was not going to vote for that one right it's like if

434
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,200
 somebody came along and said yeah we'd like to bid for EasterCon but we wanted to be a 10,000 person

435
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,600
 gate show you know they could do it as much as they liked but they would look at that they wouldn't win.

436
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:10,560
 While we're on topics that are more light-hearted topics I have been bleeding on for literally 30

437
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,080
 years about the possibility of getting a digital membership of the British Science Fiction Association

438
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:23,520
 so I was thrilled thrilled I tell you listeners to discover that is that possible to join the British

439
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,560
 Science Fiction Association as a digital member what's the catch boys and girls? I can do it you can't do it

440
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:39,200
 Well but Alison is currently international so if she just joins the BSFA before coming home I'm sure

441
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:46,640
 it's all fine Liz. Yeah no I mean it does save residents in the UK it does not say on staying in

442
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:55,120
 a hotel in Portugal. It is and I say this with love and a spirit of constructive criticism bollocks

443
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:03,120
 I think BSFA if I want PDFs the fact that I live in the UK should not prevent me from getting PDFs

444
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,440
 So I'm pretty sure why they're doing it is because the economics of running the British Science Fiction

445
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:18,800
 Association rely on the costs of printing about your publications and so the thing about printing

446
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,840
 as you know Bob is that if you do more of it it doesn't become any or if you do less of it it

447
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:29,600
 doesn't become any cheaper that essentially printing about 10 other thing costs as much as printing 10,000

448
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:38,880
 of a thing more or less and so they are worried that if they are worried that by giving UK members

449
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,440
 a lower rate for the digital versions they won't be able to make the books out of I assume but I

450
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,400
 would be very happy for somebody from the BSFA to come and tell us why they're doing this absolutely

451
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,920
 appalling thing which is terrible for the planet and incidentally I'm one member who will not join

452
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:01,280
 the BSFA because of paper publications and it's been 30 years you know I was in the BSFA for two

453
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,000
 years I was concerned about the amount of paper I was getting I was like can I have a membership

454
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,320
 with less paper and they said no and they have carried on saying no ever since oh that is what

455
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,560
 I want so if you will gain some members who don't want your paper publications but would like to be

456
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,000
 members of the British Science Fish Association because we know was that radtida for you? Yep yep yep

457
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:34,160
 are we doing to do are we going to do picks? Picks, picks, picks do we have any picks? Yeah but I got

458
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,800
 question in the show notes which is did us normally do Hades I kind of do Hades as a pick because I

459
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,760
 haven't done anything this week you could do Hades as a pick I think it's quite funny I kind of like

460
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,000
 the way that eventually John will get back into Hades and then John could do Hades as a pick and

461
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,160
 they'll laugh at me three for three all right that'll be good okay nice um who wants to go first

462
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,400
 Liz you can go first let us think of picks yeah so I have a pick which may be familiar to

463
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,760
 listeners of this podcast but my pick is a video game Hades because I've been quite busy recently

464
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,640
 and then my brain goes I want a video game which is chewy enough to give me kind of something to

465
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,640
 think about something to do but you know I when I my brain is too dead for reading etc and so I've

466
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,520
 been playing Hades which is great it is is it a roguelike I think that's what you call I don't

467
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,640
 play many of this type of game it's a it's a road light with mess progression it's a roguelike

468
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,480
 with mess progression apparently like roguelike with rest progression it's not a roguelike it's a

469
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:42,320
 roguelike it's yeah oh I see yeah it takes it like about the internet says that takes certain elements

470
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:50,080
 from roguelikes but it's typically but it's different yeah basically I think yeah I am old and we should

471
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,960
 stop inventing new categories for games like four should be enough for anyone but I am enjoying Hades

472
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,320
 you are Prince Zagres who is trying to escape from Hades and basically every time he's trying to

473
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,720
 escape you get killed and then next time you get slightly further and then you kill the game and

474
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,880
 you kind of you know as you do it you are leveling up and getting better better weapons better

475
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,720
 strategies and uncovering the plot as well I am playing it on god mode because I'm bad at video

476
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,200
 games and I would prefer to actually finish this game and see all the stuff that's in it more than

477
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,360
 I would prefer the challenge of defeating it without an assistance so basically the game is

478
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,480
 automatically getting slightly easier for me every time I die and I really like it because that

479
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,920
 means it feels like I am getting better when really I'm getting a tiny bit better and the game is

480
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,880
 getting a tiny bit easier and so that is a great function there are many good things about this

481
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,800
 game but it has got the best god mode because that is a very very clever way to do it and it works

482
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,400
 very well is an incredibly clever way there are other games you know where I will play them on

483
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,800
 very easy modes if I'm more concerned with the story than the you know game mechanics but here I

484
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,200
 actually you know I do enjoy playing it I just would not enjoy if I was dying every 10 minutes but I

485
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:09,280
 do enjoy it when I'm dying every roughly half an hour yeah and I will I will get back with a full

486
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,440
 verdict when I have escaped although I sense that may not be the end of the game I did everything

487
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,920
 in Hades I did not turn god mode on I got to the point where I hadn't explored every single one of

488
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:29,760
 the 700 000 voice lines but you know there were a lot I spent 300 hours on it so I would not

489
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:36,000
 record so god mode would be a good idea in retrospect because 300 hours is a lot. Jon a pick!

490
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,320
 My pick is going to a cottage with my friends for a week and playing board games.

491
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:50,240
 Did you have fun? I did I played lots of board games it was good I would specifically like to

492
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:56,400
 pick a few of the said board games so we played a game called escape from the aliens in out of space

493
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,800
 which is a hidden movement game where some people are humans and some people are aliens but the

494
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,280
 aliens and humans don't know who the others are at the start of the game and you sort of work out

495
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,800
 as you go through and that's very good I like it a great deal and it's it's like a you write where

496
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,680
 you're going on a little dry wipe kind of pad. I think it's our print I found a copy on eBay that

497
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,720
 looks legit for not too much money so I'm hoping that it is legit and I don't end up just not getting

498
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,000
 anything or just getting a moth in a box. I also played again called sushi go party which I friggin

499
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,880
 love highly recommend if you played sushi go you should play sushi go party because it's better

500
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,560
 and if you haven't played sushi go you should play sushi go party because it's good.

501
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:40,800
 Is it is it better as it just sushi go with more people? Is sushi go with more more stuff?

502
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,600
 More sushi? Yeah you shuffle a different deck every time so the it's not as static

503
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:53,040
 so it's it's better. Oh and it's also like £19 and it comes in a lovely tin.

504
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,880
 If I had a complaint about sushi go it would be that my family played sushi go enough that we'd

505
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,880
 kind of done the sushi go and that was not that much playing. Yes sushi go party basically you have

506
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,480
 like you still make a deck with the same like you know two specials an appetizer some rolls

507
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:17,520
 etc but you you have like a vastly higher variety in each deck because each play through is different

508
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,600
 so yeah I also have a problem with sushi go in that every time I play it I am sad because I am

509
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,600
 not eating sushi and so that's a problem. There's an easy solution to this whereas that doesn't you

510
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,960
 know if I if I play zombie dice I'm not sad that I'm not being killed by zombies you know

511
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,840
 lots of I've played zombie dice but Meg Mcdonald was saying you got her into zombie dice.

512
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:46,080
 Yep that's true zombie dice is great I have recently decluttered some board games I've recently

513
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:54,400
 got rid of uh King of Tokyo, Luchador, Snake Oil and Geek Out basically because Luchador and

514
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,920
 King of Tokyo and Zombie Dice are all kind of push your luck games and I kind of eventually

515
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,080
 decided I would rather have the push your luck game that I could carry in my bag and crack out in

516
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:07,840
 the pub and what and that's zombie dice. Zombie dice yeah it's a good it's a game it takes about 20

517
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:15,680
 minutes the components are waterproof and um it's good in the pub. Yeah no um I think I might have

518
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,800
 played it but anyway yeah I believe the time I should have been drunk while I played it and I

519
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,160
 think Meg is getting attacked in the pub of the dead dog so hey good stuff and the last day was my

520
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,120
 birthday and my friend bought me the exit the game advent calendar and the exit the game advent

521
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,720
 calendar is very good we have been doing puzzles every morning I say that we did four puzzles yesterday

522
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,880
 because that's when I got home and then we'll do a puzzle today after I broadcast I'm very excited

523
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,200
 I like puzzles. I have a genre anti-pick this week oh hello we haven't done this before I think it's

524
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,880
 okay I think it's legit right I've had a convention so I haven't been thinking very hard about podcast

525
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,320
 apart from you know yeah go on you can have one someone's out there every week so genre anti-pick

526
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,240
 which is that Stephen and I have finished the end of the Amazon Brian series we have finally finished

527
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:08,480
 watching the band and the iCastle of what after what seems like a decade and it is like literally

528
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,480
 the sunk cost fallacy of science fiction television and I feel like I may have been spoiled for science

529
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,520
 fiction television forever by this series because I think SF television does this a lot where it starts

530
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,920
 off very good and very interesting and very engaging and very evocative and by the end there's

531
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,760
 really not a lot left and if you look at it you go well this doesn't make any sense

532
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,520
 and one of the cool things about this is that I read a review of the last episode of the

533
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,360
 man in the iCastle of like the thousand hours of god knows what and it said the end it doesn't

534
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:47,680
 make any sense Philip K Dick would be rolling in his grave and thought if any listeners have not

535
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,880
 read any Philip K Dick books the one thing which you can pretty much guarantee is that when you get

536
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,840
 to the end of them you go oh wait that doesn't make any sense so I feel that making the ending

537
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,720
 not make terribly much sense is the back when it's one of the most consistent things with Dick's

538
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:09,920
 over over he showed it so I think I am now worried that all other science fiction that is longer than

539
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:18,720
 say Russian doll has this problem that at some point it skates away from where it was going because

540
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,800
 they ordered more episodes or they ordered less episodes or they got a series more than they were

541
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,280
 expecting or they got two series less than they were expecting or or an actor left or an actor

542
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,480
 demanded more money because he was very good or whatever and as a result the thing doesn't hang

543
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,480
 together as a piece of science fiction it just kind of plods on for 40 episodes and is that really

544
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:46,160
 what you want so I'm like go on listeners tell me what I should be watching on television next

545
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,960
 and should I do I need to wait till it finishes so I can say oh yes that was a consistent share

546
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,200
 because the man in the high castle is not a consistent share however it does have lots of good

547
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,920
 things and lots of the stuff about the worlds that it draws are interesting and continue to be

548
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:06,160
 interesting right up to the end but the actual plot and structure make nuisance whatsoever

549
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,920
 what should I be watching? Well I watched two series about the high castle and then stopped

550
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:16,560
 so it sounds like I chose wisely good choice good good choice I have not watched any I confess

551
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:22,000
 on the subject of long-running TV shows that I think are going to stick the landing the expanse

552
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,200
 is back next week I believe and I'm excited about that the last series and you'd say it's been

553
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:35,840
 sticking things so far would you yeah I in general think the expanse has been in the unusual position

554
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:43,120
 that every season has been superior to its previous season I think I would say that is broadly true

555
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,840
 I think that is true of the books as well I think I think in general the story the expanse gets better

556
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:55,680
 when the events of book one have happened and you can start exploring the ramifications in direct

557
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,600
 contrast to Westworld where they were like oh we made season one because we thought you needed

558
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,120
 the backstory but the story we really wanted to tell was in season two and three I watched

559
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,480
 season one which was a masterpiece and then I watched season two and three and I was like and this is

560
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:12,480
 this is the story you're excited about was it hmm so yeah you know I mean fun fact listeners

561
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,760
 is that I also watched the first series of Westworld and then stopped so apparently I'm just very good

562
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,520
 stopping before series get bad I think it's meant to be good yeah I mean I think in a way the expanse

563
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:29,200
 has the same thing where if you watch the first series it feels like it has two fairly bland white

564
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:37,040
 guy protagonists but actually the later seasons get much deeper and in fact I think those characters

565
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,840
 themselves become more interesting and also other characters become more prominent and it is also

566
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,840
 interesting that they definitely pulled some characters who kind of appear later in the books

567
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:51,680
 into the earlier seasons to give it a bit more interest and a bit more depth I think yeah I

568
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:58,160
 think it's mostly been sticking them I wasn't not taken with that series where um oh they're on a

569
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,760
 planet with mean Owen from torchwood or whatever you think that season you think that season in

570
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,040
 the tv was dodgy you should read the book I bloody love that book it I think it's fair to say

571
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:16,240
 divided opinion but yeah in general I think the expanse I don't think the put it this way I think

572
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:23,040
 you you even if you don't love season four I think in general the expanse is not um it is definitely

573
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,760
 telling the story I wanted to tell I mean part of this is because if you are the favorite tv show

574
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,080
 of jeff Bezos presumably you get the support you need to continue telling the story you won't

575
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:37,040
 tell until you've finished telling it and so like I'm not advocating all art moves back to the

576
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:44,640
 medieval patronage model but clearly it benefits some arts in some situations thanks jeff I mean

577
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:52,080
 screw him forever for gels he does but this one thing hurrah I might cut that out yes that was the

578
00:55:52,080 --> 00:56:10,560
 ock of our podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

579
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,480
 I think it's much more difficult but that's also sorry can you actually see me I've turned the

580
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,280
 lamps on but I've bit up I love that I so one of the key things about this podcast is that

581
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,480
 lisless god this is sitting outside and this has become dark while this has been sitting outside

582
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:39,120
 today lisless and my fancy lights come on and she has tiny lights and they're very good they're

583
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:45,520
 solar powered in my view it came it became dark quite suddenly yes no not doing it um they're

584
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,560
 actually they're actually solar powered lights so they charge up all day and then they come on

585
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:54,400
 in the evening for lara too we we have them in our garden which is significantly colder than lis

586
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,440
 is yeah probably also significantly less than time to charge them up the theme music for this
