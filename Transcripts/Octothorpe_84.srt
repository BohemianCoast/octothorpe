1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
 Oh, Alison's gone.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,800
 I'll carry her going and assume she'll come back.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,140
 - Yeah, why not?

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,720
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:19,960
 - Hello, everyone, and welcome to Octa Thorpe,

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,920
 a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,760
 This episode is a special episode,

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,160
 and we don't know when it's coming to you.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,320
 - Oh, I'm John Coxon.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,920
 - I'm Alison Scott.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,000
 - And I'm Liz Batty.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,620
 - And today, Liz has made us read a book.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,620
 - Yes, I mean, this is the first of probably three episodes

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,680
 in which we all read a book.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,800
 One of us chooses a book and we make the other two read it,

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,120
 and then we're going to discuss it for you.

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,200
 And the book, which is at first, happens to be my choice.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,920
 So I should start with why I like it

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,560
 and why I made these two read it.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,560
 So my book choice is a face-like glass by Francis Harding,

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,000
 which is a 2012 book.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 It's about an underground city called Kverna,

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,240
 which is full of skilled craftsmen who toyle away

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,840
 to make kind of magical delicacies.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,000
 And we start in the cheese mongas.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,880
 So there is a cheese monger who makes kind of magical cheeses.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,560
 And one day he finds a child in his cheese store,

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
 whose name is Neverfell, and he adopts Neverfell

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,440
 as his own apprentice, but Neverfell never leaves

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,000
 the cheese factory, and she comes to believe

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,080
 there is something hideously wrong with it

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,880
 because she always is forced to wear a velvet mask.

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,720
 But there is naturally, it's not anything wrong

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,960
 with Neverfell, it's the fact is that Neverfell

35
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,440
 is the only person in a world where people do not wear

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,240
 their emotions on their face who will naturally

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,680
 kind of have a face that changes with her emotions.

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,240
 So that is the face-like glass.

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,520
 You can see everything going on in Neverfell's face.

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,000
 And she goes into this very strange city

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 where there are delicacies that can change your memories,

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,880
 give you premonitions, bring back hidden past memories,

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,240
 but where no one can ever show emotions on their face

44
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,520
 unless they have a face that they were

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
 trained by a face myth to show that particular emotion.

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,960
 And so Neverfell kind of cannonballs into this world

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
 as a kind of agent of chaos.

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,000
 She eventually leaves the cheese shop,

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,880
 falls in with some of the other artisans of Coverna,

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,720
 ends up meeting the leader of Coverna,

51
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,960
 and generally discovering kind of the rot which sits

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,680
 at the heart of this underground world

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,360
 where the rich feast on precious delicacies

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,840
 and it's the underclass who keeps everything running.

55
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,800
 And everything is very kind of rigid and constrained,

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,040
 as you might imagine from a world where you can show

57
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,480
 only the set of emotions that you have been taught to display.

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,400
 And Neverfell essentially upends the whole thing.

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
 So why do I like it?

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,800
 I think it's one of the first Francis Harding books I've read.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,320
 I've read nearly all of her books apart from the new one,

62
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,840
 and I felt John Allison had not read enough of her books

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,080
 to be made to read more.

64
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,880
 I just find that I find it hugely, hugely imaginative.

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,800
 There's a whole load of different things going on,

66
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,880
 possibly almost too much stuffed into this book.

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,920
 But you know, there's whole sections about the cheeses

68
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,480
 and the names of the different cheeses

69
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,880
 and the more of this cheese will, you know,

70
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,320
 show you your greatest fear or greatest power.

71
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,320
 You know, there are wines that can erase memories.

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,680
 At one point, Neverfell meets a man named Maxim Childerson,

73
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,120
 and you can just tell from his name

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,480
 that he is not going to be a good guy.

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,600
 Boilers, Liz.

76
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,280
 Nomineeative determinism.

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,480
 Boilers, if you don't pick that up

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
 within the first few minutes, well,

79
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,880
 I mean, maybe we'll get into that later,

80
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,480
 whether it is a little bit too obvious.

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,600
 But I just kind of find that it's very,

82
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,040
 just kind of filled with delightful things at every turn.

83
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,640
 I love reading kind of every page of it

84
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
 and reading about the different things.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,960
 While it also has a, you know, a fairly,

86
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,280
 some fairly serious messaging

87
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,720
 and some fairly serious things going on in it.

88
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,800
 I just love every page of it.

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,240
 And I love Neverfell.

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,200
 I like a lot of Francis Hardings, heroes and heroines

91
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,320
 who are generally children or young adults.

92
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,000
 And I just love the way she gets plunged into this.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,600
 And it essentially ends up winning out

94
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,560
 by being completely unpredictable,

95
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,800
 because no one really knows what she's going to do,

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,640
 even though she wears all her emotions on her face.

97
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,760
 So that's why I picked it.

98
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,000
 - So, Alison, have you read the book?

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
 - I have read the book.

100
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,240
 I read the book when I was supposed to.

101
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,320
 - Well, all right.

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,440
 (laughs)

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,400
 - I read it pretty quickly.

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,760
 It's quite a long book.

105
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,440
 This is a young adult book, which is pretty chewy.

106
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,280
 It's about 500 pages, which feels like quite a big book.

107
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,320
 I read it in two or three chunks.

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,840
 I read quite a lot.

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,400
 And then I got to a point where I went,

110
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,600
 because as Liz says, a lot of different stuff's going on.

111
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 There's this and there's that.

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,320
 It's got multiple great premises.

113
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,000
 It's got these craft projects

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,280
 that are imbued with magic.

115
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,600
 And it's got the whole face thing

116
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,480
 about which I'm going to talk a bit more about.

117
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,480
 And it's got an extraordinarily interesting cat burglar.

118
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,520
 And it's got this really strange society.

119
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,600
 And it's got underground living.

120
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,480
 And just huge amounts of stuff.

121
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,160
 And so I got to about halfway through over and I was like,

122
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,720
 okay, I do not myself like to be delighted on every page.

123
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,360
 I like books that tell me a story

124
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,000
 where all the words support the overall theme

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,360
 and the underlying message.

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,760
 And I like to, you know,

127
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,640
 I like to be absorbed in a world.

128
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,200
 But she kept bringing in a new thing

129
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,880
 and I'd be going like,

130
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,400
 one more thing, she's never going to pull this back together.

131
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,920
 And there's far too many loose ends

132
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,440
 and why am I bothering really?

133
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,080
 And I guess I'll just have to go on.

134
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,120
 And then I think literally in the next chapter,

135
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,640
 she starts bringing it back together.

136
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,720
 And in fact, everything turns out to be all one part of one.

137
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,800
 Fairly well put together whole and it all fits in.

138
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,440
 And it's fine.

139
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,280
 It's better than fine.

140
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,200
 It's a really good book.

141
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,120
 I liked it a lot.

142
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,560
 - I will say I find it like,

143
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
 the episode title is going to be,

144
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,200
 I don't like being delighted on every page

145
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,200
 'cause I never heard such a nihilistic view of picture.

146
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,600
 It makes me very happy.

147
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,640
 - I mean, I do know what you mean.

148
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,880
 I mean, sorry, don't you care.

149
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,880
 I mean, it can get a little bit like it is,

150
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
 I mean, for a book which is all about delicacies,

151
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,560
 it's like it's too much rich food.

152
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,800
 - So the other Francis Harding book I read,

153
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
 I've slightly forgotten the name,

154
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,920
 is the one about the coastal divers

155
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,920
 and the old ones and piracy

156
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,440
 and that had far too much stuff.

157
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,400
 And I didn't feel it came back together in a satisfying whole.

158
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,440
 I got to the end of the book, read it one going,

159
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,600
 "Oh, I wish I'd read the book

160
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,360
 that this is obviously a sequel to

161
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,800
 that she didn't actually write.

162
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
 She wrote this book."

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
 That would have been my only previous experience.

164
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,640
 But I think this one,

165
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,720
 she does actually pull the whole story together.

166
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,880
 It's got a very good ending, I think.

167
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,240
 It's pretty great.

168
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,240
 I wanted to say a little bit more about a couple of things.

169
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,320
 So my subtitle for this book would be

170
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,960
 "A Child's Guide to the Class War,"

171
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,800
 because this is not actually a book about cheeses

172
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,560
 and magic and caverns and wonders

173
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,920
 and delights at every turn.

174
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,080
 This is a book about how you systematically

175
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,440
 oppress an underclass.

176
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,440
 And that's good, that's the sort of nihilistic theme

177
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,280
 I like to see in novels.

178
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,120
 So I really like that.

179
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,640
 And I wanted to pick up one thing about the faces,

180
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,800
 which ties into that,

181
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,360
 which is if you are a member of said underclass,

182
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,000
 you are delivered five faces,

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,800
 which include things like expectantly waiting for orders

184
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,040
 and diligently carrying out your tasks.

185
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,480
 And if you're kind of an artisan,

186
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,960
 a middle-class sort of person,

187
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,680
 you get a fairly good range of faces

188
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,480
 that gives you a lot of emotions.

189
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,600
 But only the super rich people in this world

190
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,480
 actually get a really good range of faces

191
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,320
 and can go and get custom faces

192
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,440
 for particular emotions they want to exhibit

193
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,280
 and things like that.

194
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,640
 And I thought that was quite clever

195
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,440
 and also ties into the whole

196
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,320
 class war theme of this novel.

197
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,480
 - I enjoyed it.

198
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,880
 I read it quicker than I thought I would

199
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,960
 'cause as Alison and Elizabeth said,

200
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,840
 it's not a short book,

201
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,760
 but it does read very quickly.

202
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,760
 And I did find several of the concepts very delightful.

203
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,720
 I found the ending a bit disappointing.

204
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,960
 I wished it had ended 30 pages earlier.

205
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,760
 I just, the bit where they all actually make it up

206
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,000
 to the surface, I was like, I didn't need to see that

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,440
 because it just felt,

208
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
 I would much rather an end

209
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
 where the judges had actually taken over caverna

210
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,240
 rather than being refugees.

211
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,120
 I don't know if I like the underlying message of

212
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,760
 if you are the oppressed, you can leave

213
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,360
 rather than if you are the oppressed, you can rise up.

214
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,240
 I think that is a very British take on an underclass.

215
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,400
 I imagine if Francis Harding was French,

216
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,320
 this book would have gone a different way.

217
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,480
 I think I would have rather the French ending.

218
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,800
 But it's a very minor quibble.

219
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,240
 It's the only thing I didn't like about the novel.

220
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,840
 And I did very much enjoy,

221
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,280
 especially how Harding brings together some of the characters

222
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,080
 which don't seem obviously related at the start

223
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,400
 and brings them together and also kind of make sense

224
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,120
 of some of the things that have been happening

225
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
 that as soon as she points them out,

226
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
 you're like, oh, I should have realized that's what's happening,

227
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,440
 but you're not necessarily thinking about it in a way

228
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,200
 that would let you notice, which I thought was good.

229
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,520
 I very much enjoyed that.

230
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,440
 I did love the Claptomancer.

231
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,160
 I did think the end of his story arc was like,

232
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,240
 this is a really interesting character.

233
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,520
 I don't really know what to do with him.

234
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
 So it ends now.

235
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,720
 And I'm like, no, I didn't like, yeah,

236
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,480
 I didn't think it could hit as well as Alison did,

237
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,480
 I don't think, but I did still very much enjoy it.

238
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,760
 - Yes, so the Claptomancer is basically

239
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,680
 a celebrity thief and we discover that the only way

240
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,320
 he has managed to pull off his many heists

241
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,160
 is that he's kind of come up with his entire plan,

242
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,640
 then erased it all from his memory

243
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,960
 and now just systematically remembers tiny bits of it

244
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,760
 at a time so that he never ends up ruining his plan

245
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
 by doing something which would let you predict

246
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,280
 the rest of his plan, which is just kind of convoluted

247
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,520
 and brilliant and in the end of it,

248
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,120
 he basically gets a point where he gets a message.

249
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,480
 He obviously, his past self wrote to him saying,

250
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,440
 if you're reading this message,

251
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,920
 well done, your grand plan has come to fruition,

252
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,040
 enjoy essentially ruling the city.

253
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,520
 And it's kind of about like,

254
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,200
 clearly what the Claptomancer wanted originally

255
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,560
 was power, but now he's ended up with power

256
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,960
 that he doesn't really know why he ended up wanting the power.

257
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,360
 So basically by raising his own memory,

258
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,000
 he's almost become a different person.

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,520
 And I don't know, I kind of like the symbolism

260
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,640
 of the ruler of this kind of very empty,

261
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,440
 hollow society being a man who's basically erased

262
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,520
 all of his memories and now can't remember why

263
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,840
 he spent years in the assessing up this elaborate plan

264
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,880
 to be the ruler because he wasn't,

265
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,400
 he's not the same person who set it up.

266
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,320
 - That's a good read of it

267
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,800
 and I hadn't thought about it like that, that's good.

268
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,560
 - That delivered the ending that John wants as well

269
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,440
 because I think it's made pretty explicit

270
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,880
 that he is on the side of the drudges

271
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,080
 and is now going to deliver a more egalitarian society

272
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,760
 where they don't do all the nonsense

273
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,000
 that you see at the beginning of the novel.

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,880
 And in exchange in the outside world,

275
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,440
 because we assume that we're gonna get some free trade

276
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,120
 as a result of this, in the outside world,

277
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,640
 they will now have the artisanal skills

278
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,800
 that Coverna's been holding to itself and all the magic.

279
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 So it is extremely disruptive.

280
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,680
 There's no suggestion that Coverna's going to go on

281
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,400
 as before, I thought that was fine

282
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,240
 and I liked the kleptomancer's ending

283
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,480
 and I really liked the way that selectively

284
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,400
 removing bits of memory was key to the plot of this novel

285
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,200
 and I would have quite liked to have seen a bit more of that.

286
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,680
 I'd also liked to have seen it brought into play earlier

287
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,480
 in the novel, but this may be a thing

288
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,680
 that would make it more like an adult novel.

289
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,960
 So there is a how much can you do with this in young adults?

290
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,680
 So they do a certain amount of it

291
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
 and they explicitly say that's what they're doing.

292
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 You know, if this had been written for adults,

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,320
 I think you'd probably have had lacuna in the plot earlier

294
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,280
 on that you would realize made sense

295
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,360
 because of the memory removals.

296
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,080
 But that doesn't happen because it's not a very complicated,

297
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,560
 it's complicated in kind of plot and structure,

298
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,200
 but it doesn't have that second level of complication

299
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,440
 that a more tricksy adult novel would probably have.

300
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,920
 - Yeah, I think it's a fairly straightforward plot

301
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,880
 and it is kind of a little bit episodic,

302
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,800
 kind of have the first section where, you know,

303
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,120
 she's with grande-ball, the cheese, the cheese manga,

304
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,440
 I love the name grande-ball.

305
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,280
 - And then she's coming out

306
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,680
 and discovering this new society

307
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,800
 and you get to do the very lovely thing

308
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,960
 where the central character is discovering the society

309
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,120
 at the same time as we are

310
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,640
 and so you can introduce everything through her eyes.

311
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,400
 And then there's kind of a segment with the leader

312
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,920
 of Kavurna who never fell,

313
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
 ends up working for as a poison tester

314
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,200
 and who comes to a not particularly sad end

315
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,560
 and then you kind of get into the end section

316
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,600
 where, you know, never fell, is on the run,

317
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,880
 discovers what's going on with the judges

318
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,600
 and then, you know, leads them,

319
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,040
 many of them to the surface of Kavurna.

320
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,520
 So it's kind of like split into chunks,

321
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,800
 but it kind of has a section with the leader of Kavurna

322
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,960
 and kind of gets that done and out of the way.

323
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,640
 So it's not trying to pull in every single thing together

324
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,520
 at the end.

325
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,240
 I don't know if that's a way of making sure

326
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,760
 you don't necessarily have to remember

327
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,000
 a crucial thing that happened on page 200

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,720
 by the time you get to page 500.

329
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
 - Yeah, I think that's fair.

330
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,160
 Oh no, it does though because the poisoning

331
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,640
 is all part of one of the many grand plans

332
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,200
 that are playing out through this novel.

333
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
 So many of the characters have a plan,

334
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,640
 never fells really the only one who doesn't.

335
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,880
 I did have, 'cause I think about the faces a lot.

336
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,600
 I was like, this book has several great premises,

337
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,120
 but the faces are, I think, the most great of them.

338
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,920
 There are a couple of things that I felt unclear about.

339
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,600
 I believe that the reason that the judges

340
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,840
 have very few faces is because the children

341
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,320
 are separated from their parents

342
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 and then put into a nursery where nurses

343
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,280
 have only shown them the faces they want to learn.

344
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,080
 But that doesn't really explain to me

345
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,320
 why the rest of the people in the society

346
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,200
 are going along with the whole separating children

347
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,400
 so that they don't learn all of the possible emotions.

348
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,000
 And I'm also quite skeptical about the idea

349
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,160
 that you'd actually be able to interpret

350
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,280
 facial recognitions if you'd never learnt

351
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,480
 to be a baby.

352
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,960
 So those two things I feel were kind of big holes

353
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,360
 that, you know, Fadsley books

354
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,840
 could have big holes in them, it's fine.

355
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,880
 But I always go, well, this feels like a big hole to me.

356
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,560
 - I don't think the first one is a hole

357
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,200
 because it's kind of explicitly mentioned

358
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,800
 that all the babies are strange and silent.

359
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,240
 And I think the implication is

360
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,760
 it's something about being in caverna.

361
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,160
 Who is implied as a sort of maybe a living magical organism?

362
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,320
 - They specifically say that babies born in caverna

363
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
 don't have facial expressions

364
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,840
 and it's not just the judges,

365
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,320
 it's all babies born in caverna, they have to be taught them.

366
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,280
 And it makes perfect sense to me that, you know,

367
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,600
 in a world where I think in this world

368
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,840
 we have a severe disparity between the quality of care

369
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,880
 that newborns get depending on how much money

370
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,720
 their parents have.

371
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,640
 So I think criticizing hardening for reflecting that

372
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,400
 in a fantasy novel is maybe,

373
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,240
 is maybe looking at our own world

374
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,200
 with too rosy in a complexion.

375
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,640
 'Cause, you know, well, as I said,

376
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,360
 it's a class one novel, right?

377
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,920
 - So I think criticizing it for accurately reflecting

378
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,920
 the class war is probably not a fair criticism.

379
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,240
 But I also think that in terms of

380
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,000
 not fully explaining caverna, it is fully explained,

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,080
 it's magic.

382
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,960
 Like, I do not mind a fantasy novel

383
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,800
 being like, there's some magic.

384
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,480
 That, that, like, I don't need, I don't need,

385
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,960
 like, I love that the Expanse explains FTL

386
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,080
 and like has like a coherent thing.

387
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,320
 But I also don't mind that Star Wars is just like,

388
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,880
 there are hyper drives and it's fine.

389
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,280
 And Star Trek is like, we have warps and those are numbers

390
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,440
 and they don't really make any sense.

391
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,480
 But, we didn't, we,

392
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,160
 - But if you go up 10, you turn into a lizard, John.

393
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,520
 (laughing)

394
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,920
 - Like, I think you're allowed one kind of,

395
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,000
 this is just, this is just like a thing

396
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,360
 you're gonna have to go along with,

397
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,160
 especially in fantasy, but I think a large genre novels

398
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,880
 do tend to, um.

399
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,360
 - I think this novel might have more than one thing

400
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,560
 like that.

401
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,640
 - I don't, I didn't, the only thing I don't think

402
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,960
 is fully explained is like, well, like the true delicacies.

403
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,000
 Like, and the fact that it's magic, but it is magic.

404
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,520
 And that is enough explanation for me.

405
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,360
 I don't know.

406
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,600
 I, I, and I think she uses it to do interesting enough stuff

407
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,960
 that I'm not annoyed, I guess.

408
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,120
 - When I said I didn't think caverna was properly explained,

409
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,800
 it's just kind of, it's suggested that caverna is a kind of

410
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,160
 magical living organism,

411
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,600
 but I would have liked a bit more about why,

412
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,360
 you know, motivations for my magical living city.

413
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,720
 - So I, one of the things I kind of love is how

414
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,600
 she sets up the faces being like, you know,

415
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,200
 you can literally read someone's class from their face

416
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,680
 because of how many emotions they have.

417
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,840
 But she also doesn't neglect to say, you know,

418
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,640
 the dredges are shorter, the dredges, you know,

419
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,280
 do not have access to good food and water.

420
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,320
 The dredges do not look to be in good health,

421
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,320
 whereas the higher citizens of caverna are functionally immortal,

422
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,320
 thanks to delicacies they can afford to take.

423
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,840
 So I like that they're all ties together.

424
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,480
 About caverna, the city, I mean, I don't know.

425
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,080
 I like, I like a bit of, bit of uncertainty.

426
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,440
 I mean, it was not really clear to me

427
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,480
 whether caverna is a really a living organism

428
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,440
 and the cartographers are learning to speak the language

429
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,280
 of the place or whether the cartographers are just having

430
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,840
 some kind of enormous shared mass delusion

431
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,920
 and what's going on there.

432
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,760
 So, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

433
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,600
 I'm alright to go with that as just a thing.

434
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,080
 - Your point about the dredges and not having access to faces

435
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,000
 that let them kind of express themselves

436
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,720
 is really interesting because I think it reflects

437
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,920
 the state of media.

438
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,760
 I'm wondering whether it's designed to reflect

439
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,880
 how much more control the people in our culture

440
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,880
 who have wealth and power have over what we see in here

441
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,400
 versus like you and me, like the number of times

442
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,480
 that you're like, oh, the reason everyone thinks X

443
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,880
 is because someone with a lot of money

444
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,400
 bought a lot of Twitter accounts and like fed that message

445
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,560
 and like kind of affected the conversation

446
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,320
 and before that people like Murdoch and stuff.

447
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,520
 I'm wondering whether the dredges lack of ability to emote

448
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,840
 is kind of getting at that a little bit, which is interesting.

449
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,120
 I do think this book clearly has a lot to say about class

450
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,000
 and is doing it very cleverly in general

451
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,560
 and I liked that a lot.

452
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,440
 - Yeah, and it feels like, I don't really know enough

453
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,920
 about children's, as you just say this,

454
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,320
 we need Ali Baker on this.

455
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,160
 - Farah.

456
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,640
 - But I'm sure there's like a long tradition

457
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,440
 of kind of like little lost orphans who go

458
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,440
 and find their magical city and see what's going on.

459
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,920
 So it feels kind of very much in that sort of tradition

460
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,160
 of children's books, but with it just loads going on.

461
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,760
 - I have a question that might be unfair.

462
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,760
 Do you think that never fell being the catalyst

463
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,280
 for the dredges like at the end of the book

464
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,080
 is a sort of saviour thing?

465
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,360
 Is that problematic because she is not a drudge,

466
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,040
 she is an outsider?

467
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,280
 Or like, is it understandable that a children's book

468
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,840
 that you have a heroine and they make the plot go?

469
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,920
 And how do you square that circle, I guess?

470
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
 - That's interesting 'cause she is kind of an outsider,

471
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,600
 but you could argue what she brings them is,

472
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,960
 she literally brings them the tools of rebellion on her face

473
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,800
 and she does catalyzes, but you know,

474
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,760
 it's not that she persuades them all to rebel.

475
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,960
 They were kind of almost primed to do it,

476
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,040
 but didn't have the tools to do it themselves.

477
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,520
 And I think hiding does bring in erstwhile a lot

478
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,120
 to his never-fell's dredge friend

479
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,640
 and really kind of maybe only genuine friend in the book

480
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,080
 who doesn't have his own sort of hidden agenda

481
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,320
 for which he's using never-fell.

482
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,720
 Yeah, you could argue you could maybe

483
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,320
 have made a bit more of that because she is the outsider.

484
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,160
 But that's also a classic plot, isn't it?

485
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,320
 Kind of the outsider who brings something new in

486
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,840
 or stories of something new and that leads to

487
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,000
 a rebellion happening.

488
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,160
 - Yes, and I think the society's been structured,

489
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,440
 so the judges needed a catalyst here.

490
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,200
 I'm not sure how you could have told this story

491
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,640
 to have a dredge-led rebellion given the premise.

492
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,400
 They never-fell does point out that the judges

493
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,400
 have found other ways that are not their faces

494
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,520
 to express emotion to each other and do that quite a lot.

495
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,880
 And you don't hear that about the upper-class family

496
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,320
 that we meet and spend time with.

497
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,080
 - Yeah, who are, I think it's fair to say, arseholes.

498
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,360
 Although no, the cheesemaker isn't,

499
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,000
 but most of the other upper-class people

500
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,600
 we meet are not nice people.

501
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,760
 - Cheesemakers artisanal class.

502
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
 Well, the cheesemaker has been at court

503
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,920
 but has rejected it, which I think is the key thing, right?

504
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,280
 Like he has the class and then reject it.

505
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,720
 - So the courtiers are kind of soaked in it

506
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,200
 and it's not that they're all being actively terrible.

507
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,600
 It's that quite a few of them haven't really thought about it.

508
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,400
 You know, they're very unquestioning about their privilege.

509
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,120
 So that's one of the themes, isn't it?

510
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,840
 You know, they don't wonder why it is

511
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,720
 that they're growing stronger and fitter

512
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,360
 than other people around them.

513
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,960
 - Yeah, and we see that, you know, grandeble rejects that

514
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,240
 in one way by essentially walling himself off

515
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,680
 from the rest of the city.

516
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,200
 And then we see Zuelle, the niece of our villain,

517
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,240
 Maxim Tilderson, who she didn't really befriend

518
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,160
 never fell at the start.

519
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
 She's happily going along with her uncle's schemes

520
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,240
 and using never fell where she fits in with it.

521
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,480
 But she is the character who really does come

522
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,480
 to have all that challenged and in the end,

523
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,400
 reject it and decide actually, yeah, this is a corrupt city.

524
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
 And I'm getting out.

525
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,080
 - It's interesting because although at the beginning,

526
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,160
 I completely believe like Zuelle

527
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,160
 is a very manipulative person who is using never fell for

528
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,680
 whatever she can use never fell for.

529
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,600
 By the end, I also completely believe

530
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 that never fell has won her over.

531
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,160
 And I like the book's kind of testament to sometimes

532
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,400
 if you put trust in someone

533
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,520
 or if you put your friendship in someone,

534
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,200
 they will like that will kind of reap its own dividend.

535
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,560
 And I like that as a message generally,

536
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,120
 maybe because I am a sap.

537
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,800
 - Trusting soul, John.

538
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,880
 - I am.

539
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,920
 - It did also ring true to me that you can see how

540
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,920
 being friends with never fell could be incredibly annoying

541
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
 at times.

542
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,800
 I mean, she's a wonderful character,

543
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,360
 but she can be quite irritating.

544
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,480
 She's kind of constantly on the move.

545
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,920
 Everything is new to her.

546
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
 She takes an interest in everything.

547
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,520
 She's got a 10 second attention span.

548
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,080
 And I find that to be a very realistic,

549
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,920
 you know, a very realistic depiction of someone.

550
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,360
 You don't want her to be the perfect saying

551
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,760
 to come to bring rebellion.

552
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,400
 - Okay, so, so yes, she's taking the role of a child

553
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,440
 in this novel.

554
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
 And so yes, she does all the things that children do.

555
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,640
 She's very naive, she's very trusting.

556
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,640
 She fails to appreciate the political shenanigans,

557
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,360
 which are completely ludicrous.

558
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,360
 I mean, they're very much ramped up from even the,

559
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,680
 even the madest real world courts,

560
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,560
 because, and that's shown as a function of the grand steward

561
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,120
 having had a 500 year reign in which everyone else at court

562
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,800
 has been developing backstabbing strategies.

563
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,280
 I mean, I really like never fell.

564
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,840
 I thought she was a very enjoyable character

565
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,560
 to follow along with.

566
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,480
 - I didn't interpret never fell as the child at all.

567
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,480
 I interpreted her as a love letter to ADHD.

568
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,000
 And I was like, I saw a lot of me and never fell.

569
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,720
 I very much liked the solution of maybe just not planning

570
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,600
 will work.

571
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,440
 And it did.

572
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,640
 And I was like, good, 'cause that is, again,

573
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,840
 it speaks to me.

574
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,760
 I don't know whether that was on purpose.

575
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,240
 I don't know whether Harding has any experience

576
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,360
 with ADHD or any friends with ADHD.

577
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,040
 But certainly I saw aspects of me in the character

578
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,480
 on that, that made me happy.

579
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,640
 I did also, there's, I dunno, there's a lot.

580
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,400
 The part at the end where the novel turns into a heist.

581
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,560
 Oh, we haven't really talked about that,

582
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,160
 but there's a part at the end where Harding uses

583
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,160
 like a very kind of tried and tested heist movie trope

584
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,240
 to great effect, which I enjoyed very thoroughly.

585
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,120
 And that was very good.

586
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,760
 'Cause this, I guess this is as much about memory

587
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,880
 as it is about class, but it's, I dunno,

588
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,560
 quite what it's trying to say about memory as much.

589
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,040
 But it's clearly a recurring theme.

590
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,800
 - The ending basically puts in the position

591
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,480
 where the readers know less than never fell, does.

592
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,320
 - Yeah.

593
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,000
 - I guess you're trying to say she has now figured out

594
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,920
 this world a bit, we're not learning about it with her,

595
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,440
 but she knows what's going on.

596
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,080
 And so it is one of these complicated things

597
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,560
 where everyone's erased parts of their own memories,

598
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,880
 which is like in a high-smithy way,

599
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,080
 you see things going on and you don't really know

600
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,840
 the secret twist that's gonna occur.

601
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,720
 And in this case, no one knows the secret twist

602
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,440
 that's gonna happen because they erase a bit

603
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,280
 their brain that knows about the secret twist.

604
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,320
 So I enjoyed all that.

605
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
 - Yup, that's great Liz.

606
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
 I've got a soft spot for heists in general,

607
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,560
 so I did, I very much enjoyed that whole thing.

608
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,960
 - There's a lot of different stuff in this book.

609
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,800
 - Yeah.

610
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,480
 - Yeah, and I think that might be,

611
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,880
 that might be why I picked it.

612
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,160
 I mean, there's, you know,

613
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,640
 quite a few Francis Harding books,

614
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,960
 and I think most people would probably pick

615
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,720
 maybe Fly By Night from her early ones,

616
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,640
 or, you know, something like The Lightree,

617
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,880
 which I think got more widespread acclaim.

618
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,400
 I think I just like this one for having a sort of,

619
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,160
 let's kind of cram in six different ideas

620
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,200
 and make them work.

621
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,080
 Maybe a later one's a bit more kind of focusing on one thing

622
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,720
 and in a more kind of controlled way,

623
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
 but I've got a soft spot for this one,

624
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,640
 'cause it's just got everything in there.

625
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,520
 - This book has everything,

626
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,360
 but imagine I'm saying it like Bill Hader in SNL

627
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,800
 to get the joke listeners.

628
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,080
 Now, and this actually might be,

629
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
 'cause I've always preferred early Pratchett

630
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,640
 to late Pratchett, like I,

631
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,400
 colour of magic is one of my very favourite books,

632
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,320
 and I think that might be also because

633
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,840
 he's not trying to tell tight satires

634
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,400
 that have like a central message.

635
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,720
 He's just telling loads of jokes and having a good time,

636
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,560
 and I very much enjoy that kind of just romp through,

637
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,440
 like, romp through a thing.

638
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,640
 Yeah, I wonder whether that is something

639
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,000
 that I also feel.

640
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,280
 I haven't read any late hardings,

641
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,160
 so maybe I should read it and let you know.

642
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,800
 - Let me give you one minute to look up her bibliography,

643
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,760
 and then I will tell you which one of the late ones

644
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,120
 I might recommend.

645
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
 I mean, I think Alice in Red Deep liked

646
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,720
 which I quite like, but it's not,

647
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,880
 I would say, one of the best.

648
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,280
 - I mean, I think it may be,

649
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,640
 I suspect that some of her ambition with that novel

650
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,880
 is in areas that I'm not very interested in,

651
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,360
 and I found the kind of central adventure story

652
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,680
 to be rather dull.

653
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,760
 I enjoyed this one a great deal more than that.

654
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,200
 But I will read more farting, probably.

655
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,680
 - Yeah, I mean, I do like fly by night

656
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,960
 and the sequel Twilight Robert robbery,

657
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,160
 and they've got a goose.

658
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,240
 - Yeah, and I think other than that,

659
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,680
 I like the light tree, which is essentially,

660
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,680
 there's a tree which bears fruit if you lie to it.

661
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,480
 And again, it's one of these great ideas

662
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,520
 where you then kind of unravel all the possibilities of it.

663
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,880
 - John, you really need to read fly by night

664
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
 and Twilight robbery, because you need to know

665
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,520
 why "Moska the Cat" is called "Moska."

666
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,360
 - I have read, I have read one other hardening book,

667
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,200
 and I should have, if I was a good co-host,

668
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,160
 looked up which one it was in advance.

669
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,200
 A skin full of shadows.

670
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,440
 Is that the other one I've read?

671
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,480
 I gave it four stars.

672
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,640
 - Skin full shadows is the one with the Civil War setting,

673
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,040
 isn't it, I think?

674
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,880
 Yeah.

675
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,400
 - Yep, and "Make Peace" has a ghost dinner.

676
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,240
 - Yes.

677
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,000
 - I remember enjoying it.

678
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,200
 I don't remember many of the actual details.

679
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,280
 I just have an impression of having enjoyed it.

680
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,400
 But now I will probably read more hardening in the future,

681
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,880
 'cause I have liked the two books of hers I read.

682
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,640
 I think I would give this book a five star.

683
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,960
 So maybe I liked it more than "Skin full of Shadows."

684
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,680
 - Whoa, I'm gonna declare my pick a success

685
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,520
 even before we hear what Alice and I give it.

686
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,520
 - Yeah, 'cause I, as John finds very annoying,

687
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,040
 I have stopped giving star ratings to things.

688
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,280
 - It's true that my goodreads rankings are sort of like,

689
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,200
 they're not like a nice normal distribution.

690
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,720
 They're sort of really like tightly compressed

691
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,040
 around like the 3.5 to four star mark.

692
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,760
 Because, I don't know, I feel bad like,

693
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,000
 because everything on goodreads is like pushed up

694
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,040
 to the higher end of the star rating distribution.

695
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,600
 So I feel bad if I just like, oh, that was all right.

696
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,760
 And I give it two stars and it drags the rating down.

697
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,560
 But I also try not to put star ratings

698
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,040
 on books by friends or not for a little while later.

699
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,640
 - Anyway, what did you think of the book, "Allison?"

700
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,440
 - Overall, I thought it was jolly good.

701
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,120
 I think people should read it if they like,

702
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,400
 you know, fantasy that's got some,

703
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,600
 some pretensions to doing more than just telling a story,

704
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,760
 books about interesting societies,

705
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,520
 I think it's fine.

706
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,600
 And it is quite long, but it's an easy read.

707
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,720
 So, you know, it's a great book to just get stuck into

708
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,120
 and enjoy.

709
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
 Recommended.

710
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,080
 - Do you have, oh, do you want to sum up Liz?

711
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
 Do you have anything you want to sum?

712
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,120
 - No, just I'm glad you like the book.

713
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,440
 I'm glad I liked rereading the book.

714
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,880
 And I'm glad that, you know,

715
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,800
 sometimes when everyone likes a book,

716
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,640
 the discussion is not actually that interesting

717
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,200
 because it's like, oh, we all like that.

718
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,680
 Hmm.

719
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,000
 So I'm glad we got a good discussion out of it

720
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,960
 without having to pick a really contentious choice

721
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,120
 or anything.

722
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,360
 - Don't worry listeners,

723
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,040
 'cause when we've done the first three of these

724
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,680
 we'll be starting to pick more avant-garde choices.

725
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,240
 And I'm sure Liz will pick a couple of absolute shockers

726
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,120
 in that bit. (laughs)

727
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,680
 But they will be, they will be shockers that Liz picks

728
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,920
 as revenge for the fact that at some point

729
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,360
 I will make both of my co-hosts read Rogue Squadron

730
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,840
 by Michael A. Stackfall,

731
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,520
 a book with no redeeming literary merit whatsoever,

732
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,960
 but which I still love.

733
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,520
 - Okay, so, (laughs)

734
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,760
 I'm not convinced you you're gonna like my choice, guys.

735
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,920
 I should probably reread it

736
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,840
 so that make sure I am happy to still recommend it.

737
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,240
 - I can't remember either of your choices.

738
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,840
 Anyway, that's what made me w-

739
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,960
 - That was the "Ock to Thought" podcast.

740
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,320
 And it's goodbye from me.

741
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,920
 - It's goodbye from me.

742
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,600
 - And it's goodbye from me.

743
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,180
 (upbeat music)

744
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,760
 (upbeat music)

745
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:12,220
 - What was the cat behind you, John?

746
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,060
 - What?

747
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,980
 - The cat behind you.

748
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,820
 - Is there?

749
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,180
 - Oh, hello, Ellen.

750
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,300
 - She says meow.

751
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
 She enjoyed the book too,

752
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,140
 because I read it under her most of it.

753
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,140
 And so she got a lot of cuddles this week.

754
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,220
 So she was a big fan of that.

755
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,180
