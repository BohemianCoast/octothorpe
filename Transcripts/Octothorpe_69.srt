1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 Actually, I'm just going to pause and look one thing up on the internet if that's all right.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,240
 On the internet!

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
 Yes.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,880
 Disgusting.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:26,880
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 69th episode of Octathor.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,080
 Nice!

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,520
 But this episode is coming to you on the 27th of October 2022.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,440
 I'm John Coxon.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,120
 I'm Alison Scott.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,080
 An ominous batty and I don't know these people.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,840
 And that was the best interruption you've ever done in the history of the pod.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,240
 This is a unusual episode of Octathor because we can't record this week listeners

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,600
 and so you're going to get some audio of me, Alison and Christopher J Garcia chatting in

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,520
 the fanzied lounge at Tricon 8 and we're also going to talk about Hugo Stats because Hugo

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
 Stats are timeless.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,760
 Liz as our Chief Statistician in Chief has read the Hugo Stats.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,040
 Yeah, every single word.

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,080
 No, that's a lie.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,120
 Have a new?

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,760
 No.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,280
 I mean, I've skidned every single word.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,800
 I haven't read like every single column of EP8 votes for, you know,

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,480
 best short story or anything like that.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,040
 But hopefully Nicholas White and his team who did the Hugo Stats document have in fact put

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,960
 some helpful notes on things that might be of interest on some of the pages.

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,840
 So and put some very interesting final charts in there.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,480
 So thank you very much, Nicholas and Kat.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,680
 I understand this was a joint effort between Nicholas White and Kat Jones.

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,640
 So they argued quite a lot about which things should be included and eventually included both

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
 of their favourites.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,920
 So that's why it's so long this year.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,760
 We appreciate your efforts, guys.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,200
 So I think one thing that I thought would be interesting to look at is E-Proibis Hugo.

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,120
 This year, the business meeting confirmed E-Proibis Hugo as the nomination counting system

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,560
 for the foreseeable future unless the business meeting decides to change that.

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,640
 So I thought it would be interesting to see where this actually made any difference either

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,560
 E-Proibis Hugo to make a difference or just the top six within the top six number of nominations

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
 were the top six nominees.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And I think it made a difference in four categories.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,680
 Possibly the most significant of these is in Best Novella where Agent Tricoski's elder race was

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
 actually, oh, I've got to count.

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
 It's one, two, three, four, four.

43
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
 It was actually nine in number of nominations if you just counted by number.

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,000
 But it got on the ballot because the top nominee was by Martha Wells and she declined to take the

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
 nomination.

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,120
 And then Elder Race beat out another Catherine Valente Novella as well as actually an Eddy

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:05,440
 of Corifor Novella which both had more kind of nomination, but on E-P-H Elder Race won out.

48
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,040
 Which is quite interesting, but I mean it's kind of predictable that if you nominated

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,600
 one Catherine Valente Novella you might have also liked another Catherine Valente Novella.

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,080
 So I think you can see there where E-P-H has helped Agent Tricoski who might have a slightly

51
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,440
 different set of voters get onto the ballot.

52
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,960
 So this is actually, I think it might have crystallized something I already thought,

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,840
 but I didn't know I thought if that makes any sense.

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,320
 Which is that E-P-R-S Hugo may well mean that especially as the world con attract more diverse

55
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:42,000
 groups of fans in terms of nationality, E-P-R-S Hugo might make sure that like any given block of

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,600
 one nationality gets a nomination onto the ballot.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,560
 And so it might be that sort of if Adrian Tricoski leads in terms of like the people voting and

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,520
 nominating in the UK, he gets on the ballot and that reduces how many of the people on the ballot

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,280
 are American authors because obviously the American pool will be bigger, but from the E-P-H

60
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
 perspective it will look like slave voting.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,360
 And so that's really interesting and might actually make the Hugo awards much more international

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,080
 over time, especially as we see other communities come in, which is I think perhaps really really

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,120
 really positive.

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,480
 One thing that somebody who probably doesn't want the name attached to this quote on a podcast

65
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:26,240
 said is that you are correct that E-P-R-S Hugo does tend to favor people with smaller minority

66
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,240
 groups of voters and therefore makes the Hugo final ballot more diverse.

67
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,080
 But the effect this is having is it's getting quite men onto the ballot because in the context

68
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,320
 of the major block of Hugo voters now they're the minority.

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,480
 And I thought that was very weird and strange, but this is an example of where it happened.

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,920
 And as Elder Race was in fact my favourite of the novellas.

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,360
 I'm quite glad to see that.

72
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,800
 Because there hasn't been a male winner of one of the big four since 2016, 2017,

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,200
 which is obviously like really positive in many ways, but does mean that at the moment

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,480
 a lot of these mechanisms try and make sure that the less recognised get onto the ballot might be

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,440
 working in the opposite way to how you might expect them to.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,320
 I think that's a lot about how strong the Hugo is as an award at the moment.

77
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,840
 We go say Elder Race actually came in second, so it clearly was a popular finalist.

78
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,440
 Well that's the other thing, right? Like I think it would have been a weaker ballot without Elder

79
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,640
 Race on it. And I think that was the argument because I think last year one of the EPH,

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,320
 one of the finalists that got onto the ballot because of EPH ended up winning that category.

81
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,200
 And my argument last year I think was if EPH is putting the eventual winner onto the ballot,

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,160
 EPH is clearly acting for the good of the award.

83
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
 Elsa, Siennasson?

84
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,880
 Siennasson, yeah.

85
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
 Who I met at will come for the first time.

86
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,640
 And was obviously very deserving, so hurrah.

87
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,520
 So that's good, good knowledge Liz, thank you.

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
 What else did EPH do?

89
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:06,800
 So it made a difference in fan writer where if we just took the straight nomination count,

90
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,720
 we would have had Alice's duet instead of Bitter Corella.

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,880
 Great to have Bitter Corella and also they were very, very thrilled.

92
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,840
 And yeah I think in that case it kind of got as a first time nominee.

93
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,760
 First time finalist onto the ballot.

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,840
 And also Dufit's just one of the things where Bitter Corella was writing a very different

95
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
 style of thing than Alice's duet rights.

96
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,120
 So you can kind of see how people may have voted for the similar types of fan writing that they like.

97
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,040
 And some people obviously voted in a slightly different way, a slightly different constituency

98
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,080
 and it got on there.

99
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,440
 The other place it made a difference is there would have been a tie for sixth place,

100
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,200
 sort of trying for fifth and sixth place actually, a three-way tie on fan artist.

101
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,360
 But actually what happened is that Richard Mann had the lost out in EPH.

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
 And there I think that is a bit of a shame.

103
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
 Who got on instead?

104
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,240
 Well no one got on instead.

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,280
 The thing is I think because there was a three-way tie essentially for fifth,

106
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,080
 sixth and seventh on that ballot under number of nominations.

107
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,440
 Oh.

108
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,240
 You know they would have all three of them been on there.

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,840
 But because you can break ties with EPH to end up with two of the people who were nominated by

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,880
 15 people getting on there and the third one not which just feels a little bit harsh.

111
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,400
 Yeah no we can see that.

112
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,760
 And then the last place it made a difference was best editor long form.

113
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,880
 But let's just talk a little bit about best editor long form.

114
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,640
 So EPH did make a difference in that, I mean it's hard to work out what would have happened

115
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,040
 with that EPH because there were five people who would have been fine lists who formed the

116
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,480
 administrators. Well there were four people in four the administrators that they were not

117
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,960
 eligible in this category and then Tony Viscof declined nomination as she has in the past.

118
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,120
 So essentially the people who came third, sixth, seventh and then tenth on the ballot were not

119
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,840
 actually eligible. And then so when you remove them all I find it quite difficult to work out what

120
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,040
 would be maybe going on with the EPH. But certainly Olivia Evans got 13 nominations and

121
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,800
 went out under EPH. But Oliver Johnson for instance also had 13 people not make them and was not in

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,440
 the ballot. I've also had a conversation with another finalist in this category where they

123
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,600
 had a conversation with the administrators to go am I eligible in this category or not and

124
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,280
 eventually after some discussion concluded that they were and so is on the ballot. But this I

125
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,560
 think demonstrates that this is an extremely problematic category. I think when it was

126
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,840
 created I think people hoped that it would make the work of long-form editors and the process of

127
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:55,360
 long-form editing more visible to Hugo voters and to the community more generally and I'm not sure

128
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,440
 that has worked. I mean there's also the 25% threshold which we haven't discussed much yet but the

129
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,800
 business meeting has removed that so it no one accounts but I bet that long form was the closest

130
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,800
 to not being awarded under 25% rule. So you said that in fan writer Bitter Carrera got on?

131
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:23,360
 Yep. You said that in best editor long-form Nivia Evans got on in Novolettes the Adrian

132
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,920
 Tricoffs sorry in Novella the Adrian Tricoffs killed us on. What was the fourth one sorry?

133
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,000
 It was fan artists it was fan artists there was a tie and in fact in Beth's editor I think there

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,280
 would have been a tie but I find it a bit confusing because there's somebody missing.

135
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:45,760
 EPH got two black women on took one white man off and put one white man on so I think in balance

136
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,880
 Alison's point about EPH favoring white men is probably wrong. This is this is um data over

137
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,960
 several years that have been crunched for for that quote not not just this year. There is data

138
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,720
 over several years yeah I mean it's for a future discussion but I mean it's not it's

139
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,120
 but it doesn't seem like an overwhelming effect indeed no but it's kind of like EPH is only having

140
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,080
 small effect I mean it's having kind of effects here on only four categories and in some case

141
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,560
 a couple of cases it's just breaking a tie for sixth position but as we said you know it remains

142
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,240
 out there is a challenge. Interestingly last year Octa Thorpe would have Octa Thorpe was seventh

143
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,200
 under EPH but only because of EPH we were quite a long way downstream without EPH but this year

144
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,720
 we were in the top six even without EPH so that was kind of interesting and kind of nice so thank

145
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,280
 you everyone who nominated us. We were second under EPH and we were third I think under yeah

146
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,080
 nominations which is pretty good but Liz you were going to talk about the 25 percent rule and I

147
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,240
 interrupted so please go ahead. I mean the 25 percent rule I you know it has been removed it will

148
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:11,040
 not be there in future really I'm talking about best editor long form because I think a category

149
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,800
 in which people are nominating a bunch of people who are ineligible is a problem I mean you always

150
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,280
 get people a casual person who's nominated who is ineligible especially in things like fan artists

151
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,840
 and pro artists where they have to have done a qualifying piece of work but there's a lot of

152
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,720
 people being nominated who you know just inform the administrators that they are not eligible so

153
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
 they're not declining it they're really not eligible it had the lowest number of votes in that category

154
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,600
 so it was had 635 votes and you needed 559 to get 25 percent so it was it was well above but it's

155
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:52,160
 still a low number it also had kind of the lowest number of people nominating in that category I think

156
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,440
 yeah the finalist range was 12 to 44 which I think is lower than any of the the lower end of

157
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,720
 that is lower than any of the other categories I can see on the finalist list yeah and there's also a

158
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:13,120
 new table thank you to Nicholas and Kat saying how many nominations people made in each category

159
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,880
 and so you can see that actually only 33 people even nominated five editors invested in long form

160
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,240
 and the same is true in fan writer where that was low but only 72 people 72 people nominated

161
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,040
 only one editor so I think there is a real problem here in that people are not really

162
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,000
 nominating for this category when they do nominate they're nominating people ineligible because they

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,120
 don't have the information to know who is eligible and then the number of people actually voting is

164
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,680
 low so it's kind of doing quite poorly in all three categories well and it is striking that that

165
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,760
 that distribution is by modal because you've got 72 people who nominate one and then you've got 34

166
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,720
 people nominate two and then it goes down to 26 and then down to 17 by the time you're nominating

167
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,440
 four and then there are 33 people who nominate five so what that says to me is that most people

168
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,280
 know one or two editors and then there is a group of people who know lots of editors and the sort of

169
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,840
 people who know quite a few editors they're not really big and so you presumably got incredibly

170
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,080
 incredibly engaged people at one end and not so engaged people at the other and actually I hadn't

171
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,320
 noticed but this repeats in most of the categories which I find really interesting and I'd never

172
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,280
 noticed before it's fascinating yeah they're all by modal basically yeah I don't think we ever had

173
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,360
 these I don't think we ever had these actual numbers before but yeah you get all these by

174
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,680
 modal distributions people I then nominate one work or they nominate five works in a lot of categories

175
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,920
 yeah nice really nice that really really cool yes thanks to the people who put it together

176
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:55,200
 on the subject of long-form editor the problem is obviously editors have a huge huge impact on the

177
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,120
 field and we should recognize that impact somehow because it is much more the the sort of the editors

178
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,880
 of science fiction are much more important especially to the Hugo electorate than for instance podcasters

179
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,080
 and so like I do think there needs to be recognition of editors but I just I don't think this is how

180
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,320
 because you like you say Liz it's abundantly clear that people don't really know

181
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,400
 who's doing what work who's doing eligible work etc I'd much rather and I think I've said this on

182
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,880
 the podcast before I I've always thought it'd be more sensible to just give the editor of things

183
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,680
 that win a Hugo as well as the author there's probably problems with that but like it seems to me a

184
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,360
 more elegant way of doing it but certainly I never vote invested in long-form because I have no idea

185
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,880
 what how you would judge I never feel like I can give a informed opinion and I don't know how

186
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,480
 if you if you are listening and you do vote in best editor and you don't just vote for editors

187
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,360
 who took you to dinner one time please let me know how you decide because I I would I would be very

188
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,440
 interested to know how people do yeah I found an extra thought here as well on best editor long

189
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,640
 form if you look at the constitution best of the long form is the editor of at least four novel

190
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,560
 length works that's quite a lot isn't it yes but the crucial thing is the person who came in third

191
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,640
 on nominations was Lee Harris who is a senior editor at tour.com so he will be acquiring a lot of

192
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,920
 novellas so that's the thing is possibly people have been looking at you know if you publish a

193
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,120
 lot of novellas which are all published kind of as standalone books then maybe people start to

194
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,960
 nominate you in long form when really they should be nominating you in short form he also did quite

195
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,640
 well in short form but that is a possibility that is interesting I feel like there was a year when

196
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,960
 Lee came six in both and was eligible for both yeah and what you know five things on the ballot

197
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,560
 and he was six in both categories and I thought that was a bit hard yeah so possibly in some years

198
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,960
 he is eligible in both categories but it would be a shame if the fact that it's got to be novel

199
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,480
 length and a lot of these a lot of these ton of allas are quite long and because they're published

200
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,480
 just downloads you might think they might be novels and it should go in long form but your

201
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,080
 nomination should go in short form. I think I am right in saying and I'm sure that one of our

202
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,040
 listeners will write in if I am wrong in saying but I believe I'm right in saying that if if a lot

203
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,000
 of people have nominated someone in the wrong category their votes are moved to the right category

204
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,080
 so I think if like a hundred people nominate Lee Harris in long form editor and Lee Harris is

205
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,360
 actually eligible in short form editor those hundred nomination would be moved. I'm gonna say that's

206
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,040
 works I think that's works I don't think if you get a load of votes in pro artists but you're

207
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,920
 actually a fan artist they're gonna ship them I think it's I think that's only the case for works

208
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,640
 that works get shifted around categories but votes don't. Off to the wussfus constitution liz

209
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,720
 I in fact have it open right now because I was checking the wording of the editor category

210
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,320
 okay so the committee shall move a nomination on an individual ballot from another category to

211
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,080
 the works default category only if the member has made three of them five nominations in the final

212
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:10,240
 category. That doesn't say they come but work yeah because the interesting thing is that Lee Harris

213
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,200
 got 33 nominations in in short form and 30 nominations in long form and if you combine them

214
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,720
 I mean can't predict what the UBH effects would be but that would have got him on the ballot in

215
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,320
 short form. This year he would have been he would have been eligible in both. My guess is there's some

216
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,480
 overlap there that the people who nominated him in long form will also have nominated him in short

217
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,520
 form but anyway Cat Jones, Nicholas White if you're listening to this please write in and tell us

218
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,080
 what you do for categories where it's not a work but a person do you shift them or not?

219
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,720
 Yeah. Inquiring minds what to know. Does the constitution, does the constitution define work

220
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,560
 and person like very rigidly or is it one of those things where there's a dry and whole?

221
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,080
 It's just a little hole John. Waff a thin hole. Enough about holes.

222
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,200
 But yes that is also very interesting. I do not want to be at the business meeting that tries to

223
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,320
 write a definition of person. Me neither. This is a live issue in the artist arguments there's a

224
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:20,480
 whole thing going on about corporations and whether they're eligible so it's not this isn't this is

225
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,680
 a live issue this isn't something that's just um yeah can I can can I nominate an AI as best

226
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,480
 fan artist? Oh this is going to be a big issue for next year so yeah I've asked to be on Sarah

227
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,360
 Sarah Felix's committee but I haven't heard anything yet. Listen as if you could all please nominate

228
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,400
 mid-journey in best pro-artist or stable diffusion or darly. It doesn't matter which one I just picked

229
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,280
 one. The important thing is we nominate one with enough votes that it would get on the ballot and

230
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,560
 then we have a precedent and we all love a precedent and I'm sure whoever is doing the Hugo's next

231
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:01,920
 year will thank us for starting this campaign. In Chengdu. News whose head of wussfuss division

232
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,480
 for Chengdu? No one knows. Um I mean I think we do but I think it's someone from China with a

233
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,440
 deputy from the US. Do you suppose they listen? I think it's Dave McCarty. Oh Dave McCarty. So if

234
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,800
 you know Dave McCarty tell him that the fix is in for AI artists tell him that John put the fix in

235
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:30,560
 for AI artists. Yeah I mean I think it is particularly funny probably not it's funny to me because I'm

236
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,880
 not an artist I suspect it is not so much funny if you are an artist so no. I'm an artist and I

237
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,200
 think it's pretty funny. I think it's funny okay. Well and also I will say that if the precedent

238
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,960
 came out that mid-journey got on the ballot I would be fucking outraged so there is that. I was

239
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,040
 very much hoping that the people who made this decision would be rightens and not wrongens.

240
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,280
 But it's a tool right? You're a tool. All of these things are tools that artists use.

241
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:09,840
 Good interruption John. I'm so sorry. There's but the Hugo Committee is

242
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,840
 Genyu Zhang and Dave McCarty for 2023. Do you want one more little bit of Hugo stats? Yes Liz

243
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,720
 obviously we want one more little bit of Hugo stats. Oh the Hugo stats. I went and looked for

244
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:31,360
 categories in which single transferable vote makes difference. So essentially in what categories does

245
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,320
 the person with the most first the most first preferences on the first round not win and there

246
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:45,280
 are three. Oh interesting. So one of these is best related work so basically being seen by

247
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,720
 Elsa Shunison had the most first preferences and it's not until quite late on in the vote

248
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,960
 redistribution that the votes go to never say you can't survive by Charlie Jane Anders which one.

249
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,280
 So that's one case and the other case is again are the editor categories where Neil Clark does

250
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,360
 not take the lead, invested in his short from from Ogunna Tovri Donald-Eckpecky until the third round

251
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,800
 and again in best editor long form it's not until the third round that Roxie Chen takes the lead

252
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,760
 from Mavowulf. So those are the three categories in which I saw the lead shift but it only ever shifts

253
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,800
 from the person with the second most first preferences to the ending up with the most at the end.

254
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:33,680
 Basically. Okay. I'm going to say performing as expected there that's doing what we want it to do

255
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,160
 it's fine. Yeah it's fine I mean it's just it's interesting to me that actually doesn't make

256
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,320
 us as big a difference like there are is generally like a front runner or even only two front runners

257
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,120
 and one of them wins out. It's not that people are you know putting their first preferences

258
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,920
 to something which ends up coming in fifth and has no chance of winning a lot of the time without

259
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,240
 having the single transferable vote. I guess people would not vote the same under ST if it wasn't under

260
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,040
 STV so it's hard to predict but yeah. The reason you have STV is that without it you get weird

261
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,640
 anomalies caused by first-past-and-past systems. Yeah. So so you want to have it to prevent to

262
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,280
 prevent voting anomalies rather than to get the right result. I don't think there's a right result

263
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,680
 in awards. That is not what you said in the pub last time we discussed awards.

264
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:27,360
 No but it would be interesting is something which had very few first preferences you know when people

265
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,640
 had a choice of all the options ended up winning. Yup. You know basically when in a case it was sort

266
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,960
 of everyone's second third fourth preference. It seems to be a lot of things people put down as

267
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,640
 first preference. For instance "A Way With Children" series by Sean McQuire which won. On the first round

268
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,920
 it had 476 first preference votes which was about 220 ahead of anyone else. Interesting.

269
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:57,520
 Thank you very much Liz. And that ends Hugo's Dats Corner for now. And listeners if your podcast

270
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,080
 app supports chapter arts there will be a graph and if it doesn't there will be a graph in the

271
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,320
 show notes and the graph is the bimodal distribution I got very excited about earlier. You've already

272
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,080
 done it. It's a graph. The work will be to make it in map plot live and make it actually look good.

273
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,720
 This is a very quick and dirty numbers graph but it is really interesting. You're going to do an

274
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:27,600
 elegant graph. I normalized it by number of ballots that had one nomination. I love that both my co-hosts

275
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:36,000
 are really into analyzing large data sets professionally. Yeah. But you can see that like it is bimodal but

276
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,040
 it's really interesting in novel that there's almost twice as many ballots that nominate

277
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,640
 five as there are that nominate one. So most people, the mode is that people nominate five

278
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,760
 novels which is interesting. And then the one where the bimodal distribution is least apparent I

279
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,080
 think is load star but this is going to be part of making this nicer is that the color key is not

280
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,760
 very difficult. No sorry best fan artist, best fan artist. Yeah because you've only used six colors

281
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,920
 and there's like 20 categories so we might need to work on that. Best podcast is not very bimodal.

282
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,920
 It's one five four seven six fifty seven twenty five seventy one so it just is low in four.

283
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,840
 Most people who nominate four and this is true in most categories. Most people who nominate four

284
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,480
 you know a lot more people nominate five because once you've won't you double age four,

285
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,240
 finding a fifth is often is not as hard as as nominated your favorite thing and then finding a second.

286
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,320
 Well it's percentage isn't it? Finding twice as many is way harder than finding 25% as many

287
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,120
 one hundred and twenty five percent as many I should say. Anyway spinning off from the discussion

288
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,480
 of the Hugo statistics one of the things that happened at the business meeting at Tricon 8

289
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:57,040
 was that the best interactive experience slash best game Hugo was passed. This is very good and has

290
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,280
 widely been accepted by everyone as a good move and it means that after it's ratified in Chengdu

291
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:09,360
 you'll start to see best games appearing in these Hugo stats which is very exciting. Congratulations

292
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,040
 to Ira Alexandra for getting it passed and for showing the exemplar of how you get stuff done

293
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,240
 in the business meeting which is you spend five years debating it hashing out the details and

294
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,360
 everything outside the Worldcon in people's leisure time and then at the Worldcon you spend

295
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,080
 literally two minutes being like well we all think this is a good idea don't we and winning 70 votes

296
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,480
 to 15. That is how all business being a moment should be done in my home but very good news in

297
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,840
 this particular case. I love that I was like I really really want to congratulate Ira and then

298
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,600
 John said everything I was going to say sorry it's really good it is amazing we're very very pleased

299
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,800
 for Ira for everyone who's done so much work on making best game happen and yeah we have a new

300
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,960
 Hugo hopefully that won't happen too often because I think people are like oh here's eight more

301
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,520
 hugas we could have and no don't do this is the last new Hugo yeah it's finished yeah we're pulling

302
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,040
 up the drawbridge now guys if you want another Hugo you have to you have to overtake games as

303
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,600
 the largest part of the genre and then we'll have a think about it that would be a really how would

304
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,200
 you put that in the Constitution the last that last added category you have to demonstrate that

305
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,160
 you're better than that one and then you get on we need some kind of Hugo Thunderdome Thunder

306
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,920
 Hugo there's got to be a pun in here somewhere one in one out in order to get a new Hugo you have

307
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:43,600
 to recommend fun for actual slaughtering I do think like generally speaking I mean because I am

308
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,040
 in general opposed to Hugo proliferation because like I don't want there to be infinite hugos but I

309
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,960
 am very strongly in favor of this particular Hugo and I do I'm very very excited that it is on

310
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,760
 especially after it had such a great showing when we did the trial Hugo which I think just went really

311
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,640
 really well it's true I'm usually like no more Hugo's too many Hugo's no more Hugo's and then I'm

312
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,720
 like oh but we can have best game yeah maybe maybe one more Hugo maybe a wafer thin Hugo

313
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:18,960
 wafer thin yeah is it that the category gets added when it's ratified or is it added now

314
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,440
 for Chengdu so it is going to be the first one's going to be in Glasgow okay so UK video game

315
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:33,280
 studios this is your chance to yep but also listeners listeners please write in with the games

316
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,680
 that are scheduled for release in 2023 that we should be playing that would be very good for a

317
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:45,440
 future episode I think that was the arc to thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye for me

318
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,200
 it's goodbye from me

319
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:58,560
 hello everyone it is the the Friday I'm reliably informed

320
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,280
 allegedly it is the Friday I welcome and I have a question for you

321
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,520
 why we have not previously heard the wittish expression hanging out my arse

322
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,600
 how how would you not heard that happened I had to look it up on the I knew what it meant

323
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,480
 from politics fair enough we are here with Hugo award-winning fans in editor

324
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:31,120
 and all about man about town man with the beards man with a mask man with a plan Mexican wrestler

325
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:38,880
 Christopher J Garcia that's so reductive of all the things that I do but I admit the most

326
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,440
 important of them is human being the most important thing you've ever done is the hard

327
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,480
 copy podcast that's correct actually which we brought up at our podcasting apple yeah and is

328
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,240
 coming back next year because I finally got another tape deck hey all right so I have to have I have

329
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,200
 to have tape split you will have tapes there is no question yeah so when you get me tapes can you

330
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,560
 do me now can play please yeah so last time christ did hard copy podcast I immediately ripped them

331
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:11,840
 all to my computer I don't know if I can still do that I got I used to get a hard copy podcast from

332
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:19,200
 Jim moat Jim track yeah yes he did a couple I think and apparently in the 50s fans did this all

333
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,080
 the time they sent all your time yep audio tape audio recording of material happened at a lot of

334
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:33,760
 world content lugging around the reporters would have been insane um but they're also from 46 I

335
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:41,280
 47 someone has wire recordings of panels from the world column that's cool and that's the one

336
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:47,760
 that it survives insane because it's basically made out of wire made out of a combination of toilet

337
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,760
 paper and dreams you know audio recording and fandom goes way way back including there was a

338
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:59,360
 group that did something more along the lines of an app amateur press association that would

339
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,760
 pass around these tapes and then they would put your own with them and would go around around

340
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,680
 table I cannot remember what they called it I'm gonna say tape thingy and those some of those

341
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:18,720
 exist I would have called it tapper leave this pause in because it's important

342
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:27,600
 Chrissy's staring deeply into my soul with the expression the only a father can have

343
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:39,520
 how how do you realize that yeah resemblance is uncanny yes uncanny now you were in the room

344
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,000
 where famous community body the Hugo was study committee was abolished yes can you give us your

345
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,120
 live reaction sorry can I give you my life reaction were you in the room as well no I read

346
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,880
 a taut disc golf i have a live reaction from that oh no oh no okay

347
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,600
 that's fat i'll give you i'll give you my reaction that this is literally exactly what it was

348
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:22,240
 as far as i can tell the the ex chair of the committee and i got the other committee members

349
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,600
 decided to fuck around and then they found out yeah i don't i've read the i've read live

350
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,280
 blog but what happened i'm like i don't understand what they were trying to achieve i think it was

351
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,280
 entirely predictable the world they did achieve was pissing the room off and yeah now it is no more

352
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,120
 well yes and i think one of the things we have studied the hugos in multiple dimensions

353
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:53,440
 and time wine yep um and what we have learned is nothing and i think that is actually very

354
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,320
 important that there may be nothing to the hugos and we may just have to keep going forward

355
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:07,600
 except for we need an audio you know oh no surely oh god oh my personal preference would be

356
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,000
 that we split raspromatic presentation in a way that splits out an audio

357
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:21,120
 audio presentation category but i don't know i am broadly opposed to an audio category i'm sorry

358
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,600
 rigorous yeah i'm narrowly but also i think it's something that's at the very early stages of

359
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:35,360
 thinking about it and it needs somebody in the community who cares quite a bit to do some actual

360
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,360
 work and that's probably not me for itself it's and i've decided in 2024 it will be the one thing i do

361
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,160
 is bringing that forward i think we do need we don't necessarily need the category now i wish

362
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,600
 one of the world pound of a few now and then we'll take it on as their uh discretionary

363
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:02,720
 but uh john is also completely wrong wrong uh as usual because we do need a category because the

364
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:10,000
 number of podcasts in our space if you count fiction nonfiction exceed the number of feature

365
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,320
 films in our space yet we have a category for future films yes yeah but the number of terrible

366
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,680
 fanfics about Harry Potter exceeds the number of feature films we don't have a category for

367
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,640
 terrible fanfics about Harry Potter best related work maybe you've heard of uh archive of our own

368
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,840
 well best related work can have all the audio and this is not fun theoretically

369
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:42,640
 maybe should it sure will it no anyway it is it's a day of 2020 something 20

370
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,800
 so in a year in a year that was in the past after Brandon Sanderson made a podcast with

371
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,520
 Mary Robinette and some other people who i temporarily forgotten they won the best related work you go

372
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,680
 i believe voice up in a year that began with 20 so were you in the room where it happened

373
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,760
 when it happened no that's that's why i asked the chris for his rewe were in the room where i

374
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,640
 had i read i was in the room where it happened because you left this fancy land with a mission to go

375
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,400
 and be in the room where it happened yes and as i was in the room where it happened and they didn't

376
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,480
 get to Ukraine they didn't get to Ukraine because they were too busy pissing around with the Hugo

377
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,600
 War study committee yeah and to be fair i don't think they were going to solve Ukraine so i don't

378
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:28,000
 really mind everything no they would have told i i guarantee you a resolution non-binding would

379
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,240
 have solved the entire piece yeah non-binding resolutions are you know as we know a fine fine

380
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:42,400
 yeah a long history from the past to today but i think actually it was a strange business meeting

381
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,320
 even by business meeting it does sound weird there was a point where someone rambled for like

382
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,360
 five minutes and then someone said so what are you actually saying and her response was i don't know

383
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,840
 and me chris or this James Bacon and Dave McCarty were all sitting in the back Dave

384
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:07,440
 wheels with laughter it's it's open there i mean especially on a Hugo War nominated

385
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,200
 podcast you start talking you realize you don't know where you're going and you're like i don't

386
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,560
 think any of this had a point um it's like life the point of all things is the same pancakes

387
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,880
 oh well i'm see i'm not needed here but by the way let me say this actually to all the listeners

388
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:33,760
 of this there are gluten-free pancakes available at wildberries and i know this isn't an ad for

389
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,320
 better best fiends or purple mattresses but all podcasts need to have a plug and wildberries is

390
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,720
 the plug for this podcast yeah i love to i think it's my favorite breakfast so far yeah just saying

391
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,720
 something the breakfast here the hotel is great too i was shocked um but wildberries was so good

392
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,120
 and sitting next to one of my favorite people on earth the john the rocket coxin yeah because

393
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:04,880
 he's going to have a Hugo come this time sunday night that is the first lead not over long

394
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,880
 and secondly it's not night now it's night like god that's me it's night all right all right

395
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,000
 all right burn up burn up no burn up all right my favorite breakfast so far this week has been our

396
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,160
 capisito which was amazing little Cuban place and i had a plantain omelette which was gorgeous

397
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,640
 all plantains are my literal they also had a carafe of uh Cuban espresso to myself oh which was

398
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:40,720
 enough coffee what what yeah hold on i had more coffee since then your people found trade routes

399
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,400
 enabled to get coffee yeah that was enough coffee for you yeah yeah with a princely sum of four

400
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,600
 dollars and 95 cents plus tax your princes are not as well healed as they used to be apparently

401
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,680
 that is reasonable yeah is reasonable no Chicago food is fantastic i haven't yet we have the

402
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,000
 minor problem that we have my wife is gluten free so i tend to eat gluten free but we are doing

403
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,800
 did you ask these girls to come in oh hello hello i like your get up so for the recording

404
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:20,800
 kevin and Andy have arrived kevin the fast will concert of san jose in uh 2018 and Andy his husband

405
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,960
 who is mid chair who is mid chair and who is a man in his own right damn it

406
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:33,840
 dressed as a violent or petty peckettess yes i'm dressed as rainbow dash it's very so dash and yes

407
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:43,040
 i that's very silly it's very good it's very nice it's bright and it's colorful so i have a question

408
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,520
 because i saw i saw on whatever day was i passed from the t-weds day i guess that you had redone your

409
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,360
 uh mohawk uh as as a rainbow so was that for this cosplay or did you just fancy it's for it was

410
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:01,840
 i was toying with the idea in double all right uh double and i still have the zebra stripes

411
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:09,920
 yeah um but it was too blustery to put the blade up all right yeah and windy so the without the

412
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,520
 bangs the front of that four lock was platinum so i can sponge in color so the way bangs were

413
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,360
 different color every day in double and the last couple days i actually striped

414
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,280
 that for like a rainbow and i was toying the day did going to the phone and then i found this very

415
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:39,600
 silly christmas or which featured a rainbow mohawk unicorn mermaid excellent carrying a cosmopolitan

416
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:47,760
 so how how how did you get how did you commission that christmas ornament i did not i did buy it

417
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,240
 and then i made the costume which will be in the masquerade tomorrow absolutely excellent i'm

418
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,360
 looking forward to the best so this is like a like an extra extra bonus it's a bonus for your

419
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,440
 last grade so what's the what's the best angles in this costume darling um probably about like

420
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:12,720
 probably three quarters you got to get the ass this is exciting audio content yeah christopher yes

421
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:20,320
 have you heard of a fantasy called journey planet you know i have worked on at least two journey

422
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,840
 planets as time goes through how do you respond to accusations that we have done more octopus and

423
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,880
 you have done journey planets i know sure um they are true they are true actually yeah really

424
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,600
 yeah as well yesterday no we only got sixty four yeah we overtook yesterday yeah we just we also

425
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,480
 had a discussion about this yesterday i'm pretty sure we're drunk and i've been as a recording

426
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,800
 of you and me and drug discussing it so like i'm pretty sure that i can put that before this

427
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,760
 yes i know it'll be very funny so that yeah he's like flash back town

428
00:39:51,760 --> 00:40:00,720
 i think we did i'm pretty sure i think it's possible i wasn't paying attention

429
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:09,040
 but yes we've done sixty four issues in 15 years yep yeah you know 14 years that's a pretty

430
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,720
 good going because they're big undertaking they are big undertakes and a certain john the rocket

431
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:26,080
 coxin has done three with us yes uh two star wars one the matrix the matrix i'm smart yes yes

432
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:33,760
 but it's yeah no it if you haven't read journey planet uh there is guaranteed at least one that

433
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,360
 you will enjoy that is true that is absolutely true yes um the most one of the reason was on

434
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,960
 like jillipino culture and stuff right yeah jillipino alamat which is sort of the overall term for

435
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:53,120
 urban legend myth uh tradition all put in the sort of one overarching concept and jine martin was the

436
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:59,920
 co-editor and uh we had i think every contributor except for james and me were

437
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,720
 philipino or philipina the stories we got were fantastic the art is phenomenal i got to play

438
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,800
 with dolly too my favorite ai generator uh it's just it's one of the it when we finished it we

439
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,400
 don't always print issues and i decided we're gonna print this issue because i found a place that

440
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:26,320
 would do it inexpensively in color hey that's good i got to print my uh i got to print my um

441
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:32,560
 worth um alison's gonna charge me bad dollar i'm not i don't how many companies you find

442
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,840
 to print you know it's black you know i print it black and white right oh i did tell you

443
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:43,520
 our beautiful color images readers pdf mine's also going to have a load of pieces of color

444
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,640
 images um you could also run to the fedex and do the printing there but it's real expensive

445
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,520
 i'm not running anywhere christ but there's a reason why i printed black

446
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,560
 so that we can do printing but that if people watch this look amazing they're gonna have to

447
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:06,960
 yeah i just sneak away to progar ox so they have color print air no chills no there's not a single

448
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,640
 color they do have it i blame you for this most people don't have print them damn you liz um

449
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,360
 the weird thing is had when i did the fancy lams here last time i did have a color printer i was

450
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:24,080
 actually they gave me a color printer and every it's every division at one point or another

451
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,120
 came and printed something on our our printer yeah i see that i could have generated a color

452
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:35,360
 printer probably if i be special at my job no that means you're the best at your job i didn't

453
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:44,160
 really work so i mean i kind of wanted to do it yeah and honestly black and white printer is

454
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:55,280
 it's worth everything it's there's reflecting the primacy of the text the immutable object of

455
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,600
 wolf will be more likely the pdf version which will be in full color yeah so i would i would

456
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:07,280
 definitely send your when you're PDF yeah we're not all librarians we're like but you're not a

457
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,200
 wash i'm an archivist technically oh you didn't know this that's the guy from the end of the second

458
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:22,000
 matrix here yes which i've never seen uh kind of yeah well it really depends on your point of view

459
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:33,280
 he is very good at saying ergot and that's you know that's a skill i know you said ergot but i heard

460
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,680
 ergot and i'm thinking wheat rust is one of my favorite elements i want you to say niche again

461
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,720
 niche you mean niche i mean niche no niche yeah it's a niche interest

462
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:54,320
 we're a niche podcast we are an inch podcast see told you i mean and to that i say Chris

463
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:07,760
 to to fire fire uh but we're in the shape of a coaster oh well that's how uh when we're

464
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,600
 going to get pancakes from the Cuban place obviously the spanish for pancake is pancake

465
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:19,200
 that's just that's real that's like genuine that's how is that actually yeah because it's like a

466
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,160
 loan word yeah there's a loan word but obviously they pronounce it like the spanish for pancake

467
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:31,120
 so parquet oh and see i've around my my grandparents house it's uh well it's either pancakes because

468
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:38,640
 half the kids don't speak spanish uh or it was uh oh i know it translated as pan flat uh

469
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:48,320
 because pon of course bread and flat of course uh a description of a thing that is not flan

470
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,760
 yes it's spanish has uh it's spanish this morning had trislet chase pancakes which were

471
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,240
 really pretty much so good she's doing a little dance where did you have the truth let's say

472
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,160
 pancakes gafafita it's not the same is that the same Cuban yeah i gotta go there how far

473
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:14,960
 ten blocks north maybe like so you've got the not the you cross the bridge left of a hotel and

474
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:21,200
 you walk until you get to a church so it's lift distance not uber distance it's it's ten gaseous

475
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,160
 i'm like can i catch a bus it's 38 carcios miles yes so on my tap trip gaseous it we were going to

476
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,040
 go get breakfast he said it was about a mile away and he pulled out of the hotel turned right and

477
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,440
 then when it's that and then immediately he said right again on the next block and we definitely

478
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,360
 could have looked but you were like you genuinely thought it was a mile away and that's why gaseous

479
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:47,440
 a mile is a block because it's 64 garcia miles one mile for every turny planet yes

480
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:54,000
 which by the way 64 64 issues is a long run for an inter planet jennep fancy

481
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,880
 true hi inter-demit you think galaxy girl do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

482
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:09,360
 hold on work i might go to the vanishing position later always i want to know if the l.a. bit still

483
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:20,800
 exists i believe so i hope so um so i want to go away yes i like that and a spaceship and the

484
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:29,040
 star wolf they're the only right weirdly two of the space shuttle's also have star wars that's true

485
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,400
 yeah washington dc is the odd one out but it's also the worst space shuttle they'll go to that one

486
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,800
 not the best space shuttle incorrect wait that that that enterprise no enterprise new york is new york

487
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:48,800
 okay so enterprise new york and devver is l.a yeah and discovery is in washington but they've

488
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:56,400
 just pumped it in the middle of a massive garage so like oh at the okay pulling it a massive garage

489
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,840
 is so lazily just it is a freaking so as a museum nerd

490
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:15,040
 the technique they're using in that is called visible story yeah and the idea is to make visible

491
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:24,480
 because museums we're recording i don't know if you know museums are unable to show more than a

492
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:32,160
 percentage of their collection yeah what they chose to do was to show their high value if we

493
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:40,320
 don't show this we can't be a museum things as a guy gets a really a mandate to be able to see

494
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:46,400
 the things yeah so instead of having to worry oh is it going to be on display at this time you always

495
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:54,000
 know it's there now their techniques aren't the best but the idea of virtual of visible storage is

496
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:02,800
 you know it's fundamental fundamental yeah but the one at Kennedy is displayed suspended as if

497
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,000
 it's like in midlife and the one in a is suspended on the full launch stack and the one in washington

498
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,680
 is in a garage but it's a really nice garage oh it's a great garage it's a they had great fridge moments

499
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,280
 oh okay really good massive fridge package which garage is this the advisee center the uh

500
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,840
 washington dollars yeah they're no wait the dollar source at national and what is it a museum it's

501
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:35,600
 there it's it's only an air and space museums like it is of display oh it's like they're shed it's

502
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:41,920
 like their um well like the imperial war museum at doxford exactly yeah it's not as imaginatively

503
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,560
 laid out as the imperial war museum it's good the imperial war museum at doxford is a shed full of

504
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,360
 planes too it's several sheds full of planes and they add them to decide which sheds and which

505
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:58,240
 planes that has not happened to the one who just met their real birds okay yeah and like because

506
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:04,160
 you can go from the sr-71 blackbird over to the uh they moved some of the like super old like

507
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,920
 late 19th century stuff over there too they have a lot of really cool blanks yeah i guess

508
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:16,320
 as the spritsonian air and space museum like the the part of it that's in washington is also great

509
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,600
 so i like that museum when i went but yes you would not be surprised to that it was a very very

510
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,360
 long time because it probably changed a bit since then so the last time i was there was when i

511
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:31,600
 worked at the smithsonian was 93 i was at one of the art museums and i've been behind the scenes at

512
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:37,760
 all the things i did not get to go into the spirit of st louis and rude around in the uh

513
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,800
 glove box but i know i should have but i did so if you have a badge at the smithsonian you can get

514
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:52,160
 into literally anywhere it will open almost every door and i've done this many times yeah and so

515
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:59,360
 one night me and a bunch of my hootlem friends who were all in terms went and we went into the

516
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:05,520
 national museum american history and there was things like faunsie's jacket are on display and such

517
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,840
 we found a staunch of 1940s clothing um one of which was this amazing jacket that fit me perfectly

518
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,400
 it had shoulder pads it was great it was an ss jacket oh no and i didn't find this

519
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:26,640
 i'll tell you later oh no are you the bunnies yes yes chris is the bunnies the bunnies but uh no i've

520
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:36,480
 been uh we also found uh two of us had our partner in american and so we went we found the bones of

521
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,160
 our people all in the back that's like sitting around and one of what said waiting to be repatriated

522
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,960
 and i'll guarantee you they're still waiting to be repatriated yeah yeah no that's bad these things

523
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,120
 happen i need to go i haven't seen the enterprise yet do you need to get to the york i have that's the

524
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:59,680
 that's the only one i've seen the other three i have seen enterprise when it was still

525
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:09,760
 in service and when they were sending and devor i saw it fly over mofford field on the 747

526
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,280
 uh those are the oh and i thought columbia once on the path uh but those are the only ones
