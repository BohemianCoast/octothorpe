1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 There's still one manoeuvre. It won't work if you guys caught.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,320
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,600
 *laughs*

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,400
 You guys, it was in the show notes, it was funny then.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,400
 It's still funny, the idea of putting these jokes in the show notes is the same as you don't start.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,800
 At the point where I read them out, I just-

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,900
 I just- I just- I just f*cking love- I had not-

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,600
 Right. Mmm.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 Hello everyone, this is just to let you know that we will be recording a live episode at confusion,

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,000
 which will be on Monday at 11am, we think.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,800
 So, look out for us on the programme and we will see you at Eastacom.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,400
 Now onto the episode.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:57,200
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 28th episode of Octa Thought.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,200
 The vodcast for Science Fiction and Science Fiction fandom.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,720
 This episode is coming out on the 1st of April, which is both April,

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,000
 Thursday and Monday, Thursday.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
 I'm John Coxon.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,600
 I'm Alison Scott.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,800
 I'm Emily's Batty.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,800
 And as you are listening to this, you are either excited for Eastacom

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,400
 or listening to this instead of Eastacom

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,200
 or you have already been to Eastacom.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
 One of those.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,800
 Or you don't care at all about Eastacom, that's also an option.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,200
 But if you don't care about Eastacom,

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,600
 this may not be the perfect podcast.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,800
 Why are you listening to this podcast?

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,000
 If we have listeners who don't care about Eastacom, then I respect that.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Right in.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,400
 Anyway, we have some letters of comment on the subject of writing in.

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,400
 And the first letter of comment is from Claire Briarley of Croydon,

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,200
 the lovely and wise locker from the South-West of London.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
 Or Surrey, as it's also known.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,800
 The lovely and tolerant Claire Briarley since I believe she has not written to us

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,400
 to complain too much about the joke in the last episode.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,600
 She says, "Seens we seldom see.

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,800
 I don't like having to do these things at the last minute," says Alison.

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,600
 Right.

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
 Claire has written us some poetry.

40
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
 Yes, she has.

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,600
 You don't read out letters prolifically long

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,200
 unless they are from Chris Gothia.

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,200
 And that's fair enough since it's patently wrong to pass up a rhyme for Mozilla.

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,400
 There's still one manoeuvre that offers the succeeds,

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
 but really I know when I'm beat.

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,600
 With Chris there for filling your poetry needs,

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,000
 I'm totally obsolete.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
 Thank you very much, Claire.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,800
 I'd like to report to you to Claire on behalf of the Top of the Podcast for Alison.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,200
 Ah, that was very funny.

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,600
 That was very good.

52
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,200
 Now, Claire does also say,

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,400
 "Seven letters of comment is not a record.

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,200
 A record is a round black thing with a hole in the middle."

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,200
 And I thought around black thing with a hole in the middle was a bowling ball.

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
 So, clearly I need to adjust my mental model.

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
 Yeah, I think around black thing with a hole in the middle may no longer be a record, Claire.

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,200
 I think that some old jokes reach the end of their life expectancy,

59
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
 and that might be one of them.

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
 I believe around black thing with a hole in the middle is a vinyl.

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
 Mmm.

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
 I have vinyl in my kitchen.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
 Thank you, that job.

64
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,200
 I wonder whether Octa thought made any sense to Jerry Sullivan in reverse order.

65
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
 It certainly provides for some significant foreshadowing.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,200
 Perhaps you could set Chris Garthia on to listening to episodes actually in reverse,

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
 and thus decoding your dark hidden messages,

68
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,200
 "Weter bit more, John, send."

69
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
 Ha ha ha ha ha.

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
 I am safe from Jerry sending you more, e to bits,

71
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,200
 because Jerry would have to get Claire to send her the "Weter Bicks" in order to then send it to me.

72
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
 That would be silly.

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,200
 Claire also writes, "Crossing the streams with Lulzine."

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,200
 She began to think about what other comedy trios we could work in,

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,200
 and she mentions there's one obvious possibility with a very enthusiastic younger character

76
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,200
 and older character swearing and shacking out "drink."

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,200
 But I don't understand that reference, so what are you going to have to explain it to me?

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,200
 You don't understand the reference to Liz having Octa thought one who just resting in her account.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 I don't think so.

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
 Okay, John, we'll sit you down and tell you later.

81
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
 Oh, it's a father-thed joke, right?

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
 It's a very good joke.

83
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
 Oh, I've never watched Father Ted.

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,200
 And I still haven't seen Father Ted, and it's a problem because I feel like it's now problematic,

85
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,200
 so I'm not sure I'm going to catch up.

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 Yeah, maybe too late to catch up, but it is a good joke, although it does make me Father Ted.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,200
 Listeners who are interested in our thoughts about Father Ted can listen to the episode

88
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,200
 in which we talked about it, which we haven't released yet.

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,200
 So if you could just hack into my iCloud account and get the MP3,

90
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
 you can find out all about it there.

91
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
 [laughs]

92
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,200
 But she does also say, if Liz is the EOR of EasterCon, then does that make Alison and John Pugham-Pigglet

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,200
 or Rabbit and Tigger, or no, of course, Canga and Roo?

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,200
 And I'm not sure that I am the Roo to Alison's Canga.

95
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
 I think I am much more a Tigger character.

96
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,200
 Well, I think I'm much more a Tigger character, so we could have some kind of Tigger off, really.

97
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
 [laughs]

98
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
 And you've heard it here.

99
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,200
 That will be the other opening ceremony at punctuation, too, with me and Alison's Tigger off.

100
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
 [laughs]

101
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,200
 I would also like to full-clare that I do remember Rent-A-Ghost, but only vaguely.

102
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,200
 I do not. But I do own some vinyl.

103
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
 I do not. I do not.

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,200
 Is it true that the youngest member of the podcast is the only one that owns any vinyl?

105
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
 Actually, I do own it. I do own it as a vinyl.

106
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 I have a 12-inch of the Circle in the Square by Redbox.

107
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,200
 I kind of picture this, and I have it framed on my wall.

108
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 And for younger listeners, that's 30 centimeters.

109
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
 [laughs]

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:06,200
 They have a 30-selled, 30-centimeter, or 22-and-a-half, or whatever, it is 17-and-a-half centimeter records.

111
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
 That's not how it works!

112
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 [laughs]

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
 [laughs]

114
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,200
 So, Chris Garcia also wrote to us, saying "anywho, my audio multitasking is all out loud,

115
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
 as long as they're all from different sources.

116
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 If I've got a single source of sound like everything off of a single laptop, it gets muddled shockingly."

117
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 [laughs]

118
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,200
 I usually have a phone, two laptops, a Bluetooth speaker, and a pair of children.

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 This, in fact, drives my wife crazy.

120
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
 Your wife is a saint, Chris.

121
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
 I think we knew that, actually.

122
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
 [laughs]

123
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
 Uh, hmm.

124
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,200
 And, uh, he's also--so he's listening to OctaThop composing a theme song for his new podcast on one laptop,

125
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
 writing an article on the other and filtering spreadsheets, and drinking coffee.

126
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,200
 I mean, if drinking coffee counts as multitasking, I am great at multitasking.

127
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 So, yes, top multitasker.

128
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,200
 He said, "multitasking."

129
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
 [grunts]

130
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,200
 He also mentions that if we do an OctaThop live, which we are, in fact, doing, foreshadowing for later in the podcast,

131
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
 we must include a live dancing section.

132
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
 And I have to say--

133
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
 Yes, and we categorically disagree.

134
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,200
 You're very welcome to come to live podcasts, but you will be disappointed if that's your expectation.

135
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:26,200
 Unless he's offering to do live dancing at the recording for us, in which case, you're on, we'll see you there.

136
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
 [laughs]

137
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
 Yeah.

138
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 And also wrote to us saying, "Oh, God, if you published this letter, take the serial killer comment out."

139
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
 We will do, and don't worry.

140
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:42,200
 And Mark Plummer wrote to us to say that he wasn't sure yesterday why he's only just got around to OctaThop 27,

141
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,200
 probably because he's just too damn busy playing Arkham Horror, he imagines.

142
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
 And he agrees with us.

143
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
 So, thanks, Mark.

144
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
 Glad you agreed with the things we said.

145
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,200
 [music]

146
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:09,200
 As you are listening to this listener, it is no more than one day from the start of Confusion, the 2021 EasterCon.

147
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
 And we are excited, and we hope to see lots of you there.

148
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,200
 So, Alison is running a fan-fund auction.

149
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
 So, do you want to plug the fan-fund auction, Alison?

150
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
 I do. The fan-fund auction will sell things for the fan-funds.

151
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,200
 They are things that have been donated by people who support the fan-funds,

152
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
 which hopefully includes lots of you.

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,200
 And there's probably still time to donate things if you haven't quite.

154
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,200
 So, if you want to donate anything, get in touch at guffeEurope@gmail.com

155
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,200
 and we will put a slightly disguised version of that in the show notes,

156
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
 but that's the guffe email address, and that is me.

157
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,200
 We are going to be at 7 to 9 p.m. on Sunday, which is...

158
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,200
 That's going to be like in the stupid hours of the morning, if you're in Australia or New Zealand.

159
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
 Or Thailand.

160
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,200
 If you're in New Zealand, it's getting on to be okay, actually, I think.

161
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 It's mid-afternoon if you're on the east coast of the United States

162
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,200
 and late morning if you're on the west coast, and you would all be very welcome.

163
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,200
 So, we have a kind of circular arrangement where you donate things,

164
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
 and then you bid on other things, and in this way the fan-funds acquire money

165
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
 and we would love for you all to come along and support it.

166
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
 We're just working out the details of how we're going to do it with the convention

167
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,200
 because we know how we do it in Zoom, but we don't quite know how we're going to do it on the East Coast platform.

168
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
 But we will. It will be fine. We're going to have some unique things,

169
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,200
 like some unique dice from James Shields, and we're definitely going to have one of Esther Schul's

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,200
 and Dave Langford has donated some stuff, and we have many other interesting things

171
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
 and do come along and bid.

172
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,200
 And I will be bidding on the unique dice, so just get ready for a competition.

173
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
 Anyone listening who thinks they sound cool?

174
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,200
 Oh, I might go to James Shields and do it say, "Oh, we have something from Arkham Horror on one of these things

175
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 and they will be up for 200 quid from John Coxer."

176
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,200
 I've already got enough Arkham Horror dice, Alison, because they sound official anyway, that's off topic.

177
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:13,200
 But do you have an Arkham Horror dice that has Arkham Horror logos and also a coronavirus?

178
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,200
 No, but I do have too many dice. I have over 50 six-sided dice, which are from various promotional sources.

179
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,200
 So it could be argued I have enough.

180
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:31,200
 No, okay, you're not being clear enough on the podcast, because I could have sworn I heard you say you had too many dice.

181
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,200
 Yeah, I mean, I think, inarguably, I did downsize my dice recently. I got rid of all of the boring dice.

182
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
 But there were some aspects in which I don't have enough dice.

183
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,200
 I've only got two D7s, and it's like if you play a D7 based role playing game two is not going to be enough.

184
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,200
 You need at least five. If you play a D7 based role-player game, then you have bigger problems than anything I can help with.

185
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
 You're deep in the rabbit hole.

186
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
 Couldn't you just use D8s and ignore the eight?

187
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
 Steady on Liz.

188
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
 If it comes up.

189
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,200
 That is what we call in the tabletop gaming world, Quitter Talk.

190
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,200
 Okay, one of the nice things about dice is that they don't take up very much space.

191
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:25,200
 I mean, you have to have really a remarkable number of dice before your dice collection is anything like as much trouble as say your beable bear collection or your collection of antique helmets or your Weetabix collection.

192
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 What I like about this is that I'm going to need to write a jingle at some point for Octa-Thork gaming corner. Sorry, Mark.

193
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:45,200
 The other thing that's going to be put up for auction at the Fanfond Auction is make the Octa-Thork cast say whatever you want as long as it's under a minute long and we get a veto on grounds of taste, eventiveness and legality.

194
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,200
 So, yes, you better not play, say, piss motherfucker, cocksucker or tits.

195
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
 I think tits is fine.

196
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:06,200
 Well, those are the, yeah, okay, so if you aren't already familiar with George Carlin's seminal comedy routine, the seven words you can't tell on television, you should go and look at it.

197
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:13,200
 But I mean, I think fundamentally those are the words you can't say on apple podcast except possibly tits.

198
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:24,200
 It's just, it's, it's, it's, just, it's, just, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's just going to be a big string of beeps basically.

199
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:39,200
 But if you've ever wanted to make Alice and say that Windows is better than Mac OS or wanted to make me say, actually, I don't really like Arkham Horror all that much or make Liz say that Beaches are rubbish, then now you have the opportunity to do that.

200
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
 And we will sound like we mean it.

201
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 We can be very committed.

202
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,200
 And if you give us, if you give the fans an extra 50 quid on top of what you've bid, we will actually mean it.

203
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 I would change my mind for that, that minute long segment.

204
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
 Only for the minute.

205
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
 Only for the minute.

206
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 I'll change it right back again.

207
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,200
 But for that minute, you'll know that I really believed it.

208
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
 Method lying.

209
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
 Um, this reminds me very much of Ian's Patreon.

210
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,200
 I signed up to Ian's Patreon along with Andrew January and in return, Ian respected us for a month.

211
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
 Um, right.

212
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:20,200
 We will be doing a live podcast at confusion, which is at 10 o'clock in the morning on Easter Monday.

213
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,200
 And which will include the winning one minute read.

214
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
 Ah.

215
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
 You don't just know that we will do it.

216
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
 You will actually be able to hear us do it.

217
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,200
 If we have to record it three or four times to avoid laughing, then you'll get to hear that.

218
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
 Yes, yes you will.

219
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 Um, it's four p- four p.m. for our Thai co-hosts and listeners.

220
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,200
 Um, it will be, uh, I would guess late afternoon, early evening for Australian New Zealand people.

221
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
 And if you're in the States, uh, you're probably not going to come.

222
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
 So apologies.

223
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
 Chris Cosier, it's midnight.

224
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
 You'll be fine.

225
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
 You'll be absolutely fine.

226
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
 No, it's not.

227
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,200
 Two a.m.

228
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
 No, it's not.

229
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
 Two a.m.

230
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
 You'll be absolutely fine.

231
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
 Jerry, it'll be five a.m.

232
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
 Just stay up a bit too late.

233
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 Yes.

234
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
 Do that.

235
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
 Okay.

236
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,200
 And, uh, we, I think, are on for an hour.

237
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,200
 Um, and that, if you can't attend, will be the episode that comes out after this one.

238
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
 So don't worry.

239
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
 You will hear it at some point.

240
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,200
 All three of us have volunteered for EasterCon, Alison and I are volunteering on newsletter,

241
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,200
 um, which will be called Happy Days and, um, has some fantastic artwork.

242
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
 That's D-A-Z-D.

243
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,200
 Yes, it's a sort of pun, you see.

244
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,200
 And Liz is working on program ops because she knows about programs and ops.

245
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,200
 Is that how program ops works, Liz?

246
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:53,200
 Yeah, I don't really know how it's going to work yet because most of the things program ops does is generally hanging about in the green room, fixing problems as they rise and occasionally wandering around the corner looking for people or, you know, making last minute changes by wandering around looking for people or by carrying a radio in case there's any emergencies.

247
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:01,200
 Um, and I guess most of this is going to be replaced by a Katie checking into a Gather Town channel somewhere.

248
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
 Do they even have channels?

249
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
 Anyway, so I don't know how it's going to work.

250
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
 No, no, Gather Towns are space.

251
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 Yeah, if you do, we'll have like a space or something, but I haven't actually got into the details and this is partly because they're going to have to run a special session to teach me how to do it because I can't make any of the regular ones because they're in the evening UK time and I'm in bed.

252
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
 So I am a pain. Yeah, I think that will be fun.

253
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:33,200
 You need to keep an eye out for the newsletter, which we will distribute all over the Gather and all over the smeds for the convention.

254
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,200
 This is the point where Liz says, "What a smed."

255
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
 "What a smed, Alison."

256
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:48,200
 "Smeds is short for social media feeds and I thought it was a terribly useful and funny word ever since I first heard it which was about five years ago, but it really hasn't caught on."

257
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
 So, you know.

258
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,200
 Yes. I heard it for the first time today, so there is that.

259
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,200
 And, yeah, the newsletter will be great.

260
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 I wouldn't go that far.

261
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 It will be great.

262
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
 The newsletter has a great team.

263
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:15,200
 You know, I've recruited a great team by my standard method of rounding up all the people who normally help on the newsletter.

264
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:25,200
 And it will have great art from Sue Mason, who is not coming to the convention, but is very good at art and has done us loads.

265
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:32,200
 And it will have great layout from Flick, who is not coming to the convention, but is very good at doing newsletter layouts.

266
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:39,200
 So, confusion have started to drip feed things about the program to their smeds.

267
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:50,200
 So, they have announced a beer tasting and a cider tasting, and there's a panel about Chinese literature, and there's a show by Synthony, which sounds cool.

268
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,200
 Sounds like a character from Steven Universe, but still sounds cool.

269
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,200
 They've announced the Great Fanish Bake Off.

270
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:06,200
 They've announced the Fan Fund auction, and they've announced the Dark Room is going to be coming to EastCon virtually.

271
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:12,200
 So, it's all very exciting. We're starting to hear things about the stuff that's going to happen.

272
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:19,200
 I've ordered my beer, which is from a brewery in the English town, Karen.

273
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 And which includes a beer called Crazy Days.

274
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
 Yes.

275
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:31,200
 Oh, and we should mention that Crazy Day is the one who told us we should do the one minute long read in the Fan Fund auction.

276
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
 So, thank you very much for the suggestion.

277
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 Crazy Dave.

278
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,200
 Crazy Days beer was also the inspiration for the Happy Days title of the newsletter.

279
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
 Yeah, I'm a little bit sad.

280
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:50,200
 There's so many cool things that as yet I'm going to have difficulty getting to, because someone's having really good, but then it's like I kind of calculate the time and it's like, "Oh, that'd be 1 a.m.

281
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
 Am I really going to be awake enough to watch a program item at 1 a.m.?

282
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
 Because the answer is no.

283
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:06,200
 I know at least one person who is more out of type than you are who has switched their time zone this week so that they will be perky for all of EastCon."

284
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,200
 That's all well and good, but I have a job. So, that is quite difficult.

285
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
 You poor sod.

286
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:19,200
 I have a job which involves going in and being physically present in places this week as well.

287
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:33,200
 I know it's a novelty to many people at the moment, but yeah, so it's very difficult. I mean, I'm not really intending to shift at all just because trying to shift myself any significant distance just for a weekend and then back is a lot of work for me.

288
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
 And I'm not very good at shifting my sleeping cycle.

289
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
 You can take Tuesday off work though.

290
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
 I could because actually Tuesday is a public holiday here.

291
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:54,200
 So, I as well as the Oct though live and the fanfans auction, I'm on two panels, one on bad technology where I'm going to go along and tell the rest of the panel that their problem with bad technology is that they're not buying enough Apple products.

292
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:03,200
 I'm going to go to that panel and I'm just going to hide, but it's going to be very funny. Oh dear.

293
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:16,200
 I do have a, I do actually have one spectacular story about terrible Apple products which is going in my blog on the 31st of March. So, so I might manage to find some time for that.

294
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:23,200
 And then the other panel I'm on is on ways to stay sane and focused in the apocalypse.

295
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:31,200
 It's actually about lockdown past times, which I think I have done a great many of and due to not having a job that I need to go places for.

296
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,200
 And so I think that should be a pretty good panel and I'm looking forward to it. And I think John is on 106 items.

297
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,200
 So yes, I am on many program items.

298
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:49,200
 I did initially turn one down and then they were like, but you'll be good at it. And I was like, okay.

299
00:19:49,200 --> 00:20:00,200
 So, I am on a panel called an even newer hope, the next generation of Star Wars, which I found confusing because I thought next generation was a Star Trek show, but clearly I'm wrong.

300
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:10,200
 I'm on artificial intelligence, poor trails in SF compared to the real world, which I'm moderating, and which features Liz Williams, Charlie Stross and Trisha Sullivan.

301
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
 I'm on Good Luck.

302
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,200
 I'm on D&D through the ages and what lies ahead.

303
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,200
 I'm on itch.io crowdfunding and the growth of indie games.

304
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:28,200
 I'm on Beyond the Big Names, favorite little RPGs, and I'm on accessibility in gaming, Braille Dice to controller remapping.

305
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:35,200
 So, yeah, should be good. Mostly games. The astute listener will have discerned.

306
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
 It's open at your everything, John. That's a lot.

307
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,200
 I'm good at talking about games, which I think is why I'm on so many games ones.

308
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
 How many panels are you on in the end, John? Well, panel/items.

309
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
 Seven.

310
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
 Yep.

311
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
 No.

312
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,200
 People who are not professionally engaged in science fiction should probably not be on that much stuff.

313
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,200
 Yeah, I'm on zero because I didn't volunteer to do any.

314
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,200
 What I've put in here is that you could say at this point, "I'll be at the bar."

315
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,200
 I don't even know if there'll be a bar. It's in gather.

316
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,200
 I presume there'll be a bar somewhere in gather, but who knows?

317
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:19,200
 I will be somewhere probably trying to see if I can stretch the boundaries of gather as far as they go.

318
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,200
 I think on the subject of being on or not being on too many program items,

319
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:36,200
 I think the problem is with Eastcons at the moment is that there are not enough people who can talk intelligently about games.

320
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,200
 Oh, yeah. No, that might be true. But seriously, you keep talking about this, about all the privilege.

321
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:50,200
 I should not be ending up in a position where white men who can talk about games end up being put on seven games panels.

322
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
 All they should say, "We need John for the games panels. We will not put him on the Star Wars panel.

323
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,200
 We will put somebody else, maybe a black woman or maybe just anyone else, onto a games panel because we have too many white men on panels."

324
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
 Anyway.

325
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:09,200
 But certainly, like, I'm on the AI panel because I'm moderating, and I did turn that down originally.

326
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,200
 But I think part of the reason they've put me on that is basically because I can moderate, and I am technical enough to be able to do a good job,

327
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,200
 but not knowledgeable enough to actually kind of have a big impact on the panel, which is kind of what you want from the moderator, I think.

328
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:31,200
 I am quite looking forward to the Spanish Bake Off, and I do have an idea which I will attempt to bring to fruition,

329
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 but I've only got four days to do it, and I'm not sure I can actually buy all the things I need.

330
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:44,200
 But if I can do it, it'll be cool. And if I don't, we'll just pretend I never said it, and I'll sit here eating, like, failed cupcakes in the privacy of my own house.

331
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:53,200
 I think the Bake Off is a very good thing where they've given us a good example of something where they've given us a prior warning,

332
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:02,200
 but I kind of looked at it and went, "Oh, they have not given me enough prior warning that I would have liked a month for that, please.

333
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,200
 I'd have liked to have had a couple of weeks to really work up a good idea, a week to source the ingredients,

334
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,200
 and then a week to have two or three goes at it." And that's not a thing that's happening.

335
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,200
 Their person constructing the Gathertown environment for confusion is Alex Stora.

336
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,200
 People who have been to convention art shows will probably have seen Alex's art.

337
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:30,200
 I know I've seen his work at Novicon art shows in particular, but I assume he's also exhibited at previous WorldCon,

338
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,200
 Easticons, and they are producing the Gathertown environment.

339
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:46,200
 The announcement on the confusion Facebook seems to imply that there will be a musical component to the Gathertown environment.

340
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
 And I have a little rant.

341
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,200
 So this dropped me into a flat spit, because if you know anything about science fiction conventions and science fiction fans,

342
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:05,200
 you'll know that part of the negotiation with the hotel is getting the hotel to turn off incidental music everywhere in the hotel space

343
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,200
 that you can possibly get them to do that, and that part of your negotiation with the tech team is to say to the tech team,

344
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 "You must not play any incidental music, or if you do, you must play it very, very quietly and they will ignore that."

345
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:26,200
 And in general, there is a major problem with accessibility for incidental music, because most fans hate it.

346
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,200
 So I kind of went, I saw this announcement, I'm not sure they're not planning to put background music,

347
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:43,200
 or indeed any sort of music, into Gather, because you might not want to add extra bells and whistles when people are already struggling with the computer load

348
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:54,200
 that Gather is putting on their computers, and you might not want to add extra bells and whistles when people are clearly struggling with the cognitive load that Gather is putting on their brains.

349
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,200
 So I'm a bit worried about it. I'm probably just being paranoid.

350
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,200
 Yeah, I think it's hard to know until we get there, but from the little bit of fling about I did with Gathertown,

351
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,200
 which I will say has made me more positive about it, because once I had a little bit of messing around with it,

352
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,200
 I would say that drove my little avatar around and sat them chairs and had discussions, I feel it's a bit more promising.

353
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,200
 But I think it could be that they have certain aspects of the Gather, which are certain areas where you go and there is art and music,

354
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,200
 and it's more like a sort of interesting insulation to look at.

355
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,200
 And then you come to the bar, which has no incidental music, and you chat to people.

356
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
 And that would be totally fine, I think. Look at me being optimistic.

357
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:39,200
 It's an accessibility issue. 25% of people aged over 50 have hearing loss.

358
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,200
 If you have hearing loss, then having extraneous unnecessary sounds in your environment makes everything worse.

359
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:54,200
 I do not have hearing loss, but I am basically the anti-criscasia in that if I am listening to a particular audio source,

360
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,200
 I want to listen only to that audio source, and if you introduce another one, then it confuses my brain.

361
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:07,200
 So basically I just want to chat to people, not have other music, but I am sure that the music will turn off if you enter an actual conversation with people,

362
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,200
 or it will be in certain areas. I can't say it would be there all the time, because that's obviously just not going to work if you are trying to chat to people.

363
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,200
 So, yeah, it's an access issue. They shouldn't do it. If they do do it, they should make it easy to turn off.

364
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:26,200
 I may be being totally paranoid and they have no plans for us at all, and then I will look silly, which is fine, and I will be very happy.

365
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,200
 They will not be in the musical in the newsletter room. Come hang out there.

366
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,200
 I say this. You are going to have a newsletter room full of people now, Alice, and you realise that?

367
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
 It's tragic.

368
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:44,200
 Yeah, this is one of those things where I don't mind incidental music, but I do really mind people distracting me when I am working on the newsletter.

369
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,200
 Okay, so the newsletter room is going to have a private space for just the person who has actually tried to do the hard work.

370
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,200
 Yeah, that actually is quite a good feature of Gather, is you can set up the little isolation booth in Gather.

371
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:06,200
 So the person can literally be sitting in the newsletter, doing the newsletter, and people can pop in and talk to them, but they can also have background conversations, and it won't disturb the actual newsletter editor.

372
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
 That seems quite good.

373
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,200
 I've been running some Gather practices and plays for my mates, and they've been pretty good.

374
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:27,200
 What we're finding, I think, is probably that about 80% of people play around for about five minutes, and though this is cool, and then get into a conversation with somebody and chat for a bit, and go, "Oh, that works."

375
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:39,200
 And then the other 10 or 20% find it a bit harder to get to grips with, and some of those people just hate it in the way that some people hate Zoom.

376
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,200
 Some people hate this, discord. Some people hate everything. So there is no internet.

377
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,200
 Some people probably hate hotels while we're thinking about it.

378
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,200
 There is nothing that is going to work for everyone. Gather's pretty solid.

379
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:02,200
 Yeah, there are hotels that I think are good at Eastacorn hotels that many people think are not great Eastacorn hotels, and quite often for the same reasons, I think.

380
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:22,200
 I like hotels where there's lots of little nooks and crannies and corners where you can go and have chats and hang out, but for some people those are the worst, because then they don't feel as comfortable in places where they can't get a feel for how the hotel is laid out, and they don't know what talk was around corners and things like that.

381
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,200
 So yeah, you really can't have something that pleases everyone, and I think that's as true for internet things as it is for real world hotels.

382
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,200
 I think the difference here is that obviously the actual hotel is a thing you bid on, usually two years in advance.

383
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:43,200
 But that's pandemics for you.

384
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:58,200
 Future Easter Kams. So, Eastacorn in 2022 is being led by Phil Dyson, and we don't have much information about it at the moment, but presumably they will be bidding at the bid session on, I'm assuming, Easter Sunday.

385
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,200
 I'm assuming that's because they've got a big launch planned, and it's going to be amazing.

386
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,200
 Yes, so I don't know, as I said, not much has kind of leaked out of that bid, so we will be excitedly looking forward to what they say.

387
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:27,200
 One of the things I am interested to see what they say is what they say about their plans for virtualisation in the event that this time next year, there has been a new variant that does not easily react to the vaccine.

388
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:38,200
 And we are all still in lockdown. I am wondering what their plans will be around that, and if they don't have any, I'll be voting against.

389
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
 So, Phil, if you're listening.

390
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
 Your array of sunshine, John.

391
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:50,200
 They may or may not have some, but they'll have an answer to that question, because this is something I've talked to Phil about on numerous occasions over the years.

392
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:57,200
 If I was answering that question now, I would say, that's a really good question. Obviously we're planning for the possibility.

393
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 What we're going to do is reflect on the experience of people this weekend and other conventions, and then put together a plan for a virtual convention based on those experiences.

394
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,200
 Because they can't have a plan to say, "Yeah, we're going to use gather, it's awesome."

395
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,200
 Or a plan to say, "We're not going to use gather, it's pants."

396
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
 You know, so...

397
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
 I mean, no, for enough.

398
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,200
 I just want to know that they've thought about it. I don't necessarily need to know what their thoughts were.

399
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:37,200
 And then there is no bid for 2023 as far as we are aware, and if you are aware of a bid for 2023, please do let us know we would be very interested to hear.

400
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
 Yeah, we'll ask this again on Sunday morning.

401
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
 We will ask this again on Sunday morning.

402
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:50,200
 I'm much more relaxed than I'd normally be about there not being a bid for 2023 because I think this might be a very good year to plan for one year bidding.

403
00:30:50,200 --> 00:31:01,200
 I know that Phil has had some issues getting a hotel for 2022 because hotels are not in a good place to have these sorts of conversations at the moment.

404
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:12,200
 And it may be easier to just kind of wait and see and then design a plan for 2023 based on what the world looks like in about six or eight months time.

405
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:20,200
 Yeah. I mean, in one year, there have been many good one year East cons, so I'm not too worried if that is what ends up happening.

406
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,200
 However, is anything happening in 2024, John?

407
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 Yes, so Farah Mendelssohn and Pat McMurry are co-chairing a bid for East con 2024. So far.

408
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,200
 I think you meant we can exclusively announce.

409
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
 Sorry.

410
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,200
 Dun dun dun dun dun.

411
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:49,200
 Yes, we can exclusively reveal that Farah Mendelssohn and Pat McMurry are bidding for 2024 to hold an Easter con.

412
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,200
 This is partly because the Easter in 2024 doesn't overlap with Passover.

413
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,200
 So Farah is very excited about that.

414
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,200
 And obviously that will also be a UK World con year.

415
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:07,200
 So they're kind of putting their stake in the ground now to kind of say, if you're not working on World con, why not come and work on the Easter con?

416
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:17,200
 The Convention Committee will be announced in more detail at confusion, but suffice it to say that I am the head of communications for that bid

417
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:30,200
 because I got all excited and then I said yes a lot of times and Alison and Liz promised to show me how to say no to things in the future.

418
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,200
 We have a series of remedial training exercises planned.

419
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
 But yeah, no, I'm excited.

420
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:52,200
 As listeners know, I have thoughts about Easter con communications. And so this is kind of an opportunity for me to put those thoughts and opinions into action.

421
00:32:52,200 --> 00:33:08,200
 So I will be overseeing social media and publications under my communications banner and trying to make sure there's a little bit more joined up thinking between those two aspects of the Convention than might have been traditional in the past.

422
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:18,200
 I think you should actually be the Deputy Head of Communications because I've always seen you as more of a Sam Seaborn type than a Toby Ziegler.

423
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
 I think that was a reference.

424
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,200
 It was a reference and some of our audience will get it.

425
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
 It's a Westring reference, right?

426
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
 Yes.

427
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,200
 I was very flattering. I said I called you Rob Lowe. I mean, that's quite a flattering one John. You can leave that one in.

428
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:38,200
 Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That is literally the best thing you've ever said about me.

429
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,200
 I got that reference too.

430
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,200
 What reference?

431
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,200
 But yeah, no, so I'm excited. I mean, basically to very quickly,

432
00:33:50,200 --> 00:34:05,200
 we see my opinions about communications. It is that very often publications are seen as the act of making PDF or printed artifacts to communicate information.

433
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:15,200
 And then your website and social media team are communicating exactly the same information, but with no proper crossover with the publications that you're putting out.

434
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:25,200
 And this is something that we were kind of beginning to struggle with a little bit of long gone three even because the role of disseminating information was kind of split between publications and promotions.

435
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,200
 And that was kind of not good for being able to take a unified approach to getting messages out.

436
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:38,200
 And so one of the things I wanted to do for a while is try and make those a little bit more joined up.

437
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
 And that is what I'm going to be doing for EasterCon in 2024.

438
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,200
 So if anyone's interested in being the head of social media, do let me know.

439
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,200
 I like doing social media for conventions.

440
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,200
 There's basically 95% of the work happens in the last week before the convention.

441
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,200
 Social media for an EasterCon is two different jobs because there is a job that you do all the way along.

442
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:10,200
 And then there's a kind of job you do in the last week before the convention and during the convention where you are reacting to things that people are doing.

443
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
 Things that people are saying to you and about you.

444
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:23,200
 But before that, although people do say things on social media to you and about you, mostly your job is just to channel those to other people at the convention who need to know about them.

445
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,200
 And it's very easy for an EasterCon sized convention.

446
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:35,200
 It's a very easy relaxed job that takes about five minutes a day when you're on social media anyway.

447
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,200
 But then the last month is kind of like a velociraptor.

448
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,200
 So you need a big team and all of that stuff.

449
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:54,200
 But that means that in terms of a head of social media, you probably just need a social media person and they might not be the same person that you have running that reactive team on the day because that's a management.

450
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
 That's possibly true.

451
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:08,200
 And I think the role of social media is twofold and I think you've kind of outlined that well in that it is communicating in both directions, communicating things from the EasterCon to the membership.

452
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,200
 And communicating things in the reverse direction.

453
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:22,200
 But also communicating and trying to reach out beyond the current membership to the rest of social media who might be interested.

454
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,200
 So you've kind of got that almost like a third component.

455
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:34,200
 And I think the reason I want to point someone sooner rather than later is because I'm also actually not great at social media.

456
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:43,200
 I understand in sort of academic sense how it works, but I'm not good at that kind of retweeting people on Twitter sort of engagement.

457
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:51,200
 So I am keen to have someone on board who can address that sort of lack of expertise on the team.

458
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:59,200
 Other thing about social media is that you find that a lot of your job is answering queries of the form.

459
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:07,200
 I have written in the approved manner to the approved part of the convention and I have heard nothing back what is going on.

460
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,200
 And if your convention is well formed and is running happily, most of the time that won't happen at all.

461
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:21,200
 And when it does happen, all you need to do is kind of send little messages saying, "Have you had something got into spam?

462
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,200
 Have you just forgotten to go back to this person? Can you sort it out so that we aren't getting them whining on Twitter?"

463
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,200
 And when conventions are not being very well run, you get a lot more of that sort of thing.

464
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,200
 So it's kind of a very good early warning.

465
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:51,200
 This is why the actual head of social media is probably ought to be on the committee because it's kind of a feelers for the chair about what bits of their convention structure are working properly because people are writing to them and not getting any replies.

466
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,200
 Yeah, so there's that too.

467
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,200
 It's quite useful as a spy for the chair. Not that the chair needs spies, but the chair totally needs spies.

468
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:08,200
 It's almost like for those people listening who have played a lot of Warhammer 40,000, the social media team is almost like the commissar of the convention.

469
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
 Doctor thought, gaming corner.

470
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,200
 Hog will get that joke and he will think it's funny. And that is why it's in the podcast.

471
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:22,200
 The podcast is basically a series of increasingly misjokes aimed at a very small number of listeners.

472
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
 It's almost like a fan scene.

473
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
 It is almost like a fan scene.

474
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:33,200
 I do want to talk about the Seder.

475
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:42,200
 I'm probably going to write about this for a fan scene, but Julian Polak said about a month ago, "Oh, I'm a bit sad because my Seder plans have fallen through."

476
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,200
 And those of us who remember Rec Arts SF fandom, which was a Usenet group,

477
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,200
 Usenet was a thing that we used to have on the internet when the internet was a series of tubes, John.

478
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
 I was on NewsNet.

479
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,200
 Yeah, I was on Altfhand Doctor's Adams and Altfhand Star Wars Jar Jar Binks Die Die Die.

480
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
 Yeah, okay. I guess she's fine.

481
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,200
 So Rec Arts SF fandom was kind of like an alt group that accidentally fell into the Rec groups for reasons that are complicated.

482
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:18,200
 And they used to talk about Jewish minutiae a lot, and I always vaguely wanted to go to a Passover Seder,

483
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
 but I never really had the opportunity.

484
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,200
 And Julian said, "Oh, I don't know my plans for the Seder have fallen through."

485
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
 So we said, "Well, can we do it online?"

486
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:36,200
 And I just wanted to mention it because one of the things that has been helping me stay sane this year is spotting opportunities for things that you could never possibly do in other years,

487
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:48,200
 like have a Zoom Seder on multiple different continents with people coming together from all sorts of different Jewish traditions,

488
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
 and also no Jewish traditions whatsoever.

489
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,200
 And while breaking bread together, and it was very interesting and good fun,

490
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,200
 and it also gave me the rare opportunity to drink four glasses of wine before noon,

491
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:09,200
 which is not something that I normally do, because we were on Canberra time experiencing an Australian Seder,

492
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:19,200
 which involved singing one extremely important Jewish religious blessing to the tune of "Waltzing Matilda",

493
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:27,200
 which was amusing, and another much less serious Jewish song to the tune of Clementine,

494
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
 which was much more the normal sort of thing.

495
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,200
 And it was fun and we had lots of good people, and it was mostly Spanish, but not entirely Spanish.

496
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,200
 And it seemed like exactly what fandom ought to do.

497
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:47,200
 And I was not the only person who was primarily there because we remember all the talks about Judaism in records as a fandom 25 years ago or more.

498
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,200
 That's all I really want to say about it. I thought I was short enough, really.

499
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:57,200
 And also weird food things, very weird food things, like a lamb bone.

500
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,200
 Yes, yeah, and chopped liver.

501
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
 And chopped liver, which is delicious.

502
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:10,200
 I kind of like chopped liver has a terrible reputation, but as in fact, it's like very nice pate that you've made yourself from fresh liver and it's delicious.

503
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
 Do you like pate?

504
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,200
 Pate is great. So is it better or worse than Tereen?

505
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
 Do you mean tarene?

506
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,200
 It's kind of a trip to read because it's quite a course, pate.

507
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,200
 Okay, cool. I think you mean pate.

508
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
 Pate.

509
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:35,200
 Yeah, I got in trouble for considering tarene to be a solid and trying to take it on an aeroplane,

510
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,200
 and then we had to have a debate about whether my tarene was in fact solid or a liquid.

511
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
 Oh, God.

512
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:47,200
 Over the liquid limit. And it hadn't occurred to me that actually it might be, you know, fine enough

513
00:41:47,200 --> 00:42:00,200
 to be non-liquid. And I didn't really want to open it and have to like pull it out to demonstrate it was quite solid, but I, we ended up agreeing that it was in fact quite a, you know, course, Tereen, and I could be allowed to take it back on the plane with me.

514
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:12,200
 I have never concealed explosives in pate, but one of the other things that you do for the cedar is a roasted egg and shaders egg exploded. So, so there's that.

515
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,200
 The roasted egg sounded absolutely gross.

516
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:27,200
 It is absolutely horrible. And although in some traditions, it's eaten as part of the service in Gillian's tradition. It just sits on the table like the bone and is just ritual.

517
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:34,200
 And, and then she does eat at the very start of the, of the feast part of the cedar.

518
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:45,200
 She eats hard boiled eggs dipped in saltwater, but they're not the hard boiled eggs that was roasted. It's a different hard boiled egg, which, and a hard boiled egg dipped in saltwater is delicious.

519
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,200
 As is cold boiled potato dipped in saltwater, I had no idea. Both of those things are very tasty.

520
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:58,200
 I'm a bit jealous, but you did do it at six in the morning UK time and I did not get up. I was in bed.

521
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:10,200
 So, so Lillian Edwards is, is Jewish by heritage, I think not my practice generally. And I did think, oh, I should tell Lillian about the cedar because she might not know about it.

522
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,200
 And then I thought, oh Lillian, six thirty in the morning. That's not ever going to happen is it. So, and indeed it didn't.

523
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:22,200
 On the subject of getting up early, what are your plans for East Con Breakfast? This is an important issue.

524
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,200
 I mean, are you asking me? Both of you. Like, like East Con Breakfast.

525
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:39,200
 I would love to have breakfast with you. I don't know whether there'll be breakfast programme items, because a lot of conventions have had sort of general communal breakfasty things and it's been very good.

526
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,200
 It's kind of set you up for the day and I think, oh yes, I'm having breakfast.

527
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,200
 Yeah.

528
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,200
 Yeah, I'm for breakfast. I mean, it will be mid afternoon for me. So, I probably won't actually eat breakfast, but I can have an extra coffee.

529
00:43:50,200 --> 00:44:00,200
 Hey, coffee's good. Yes, we have Tim's Beast Row has reopened. That's good. But our favourite cafe will still be shut at Easter.

530
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:10,200
 So, there's no, there's nowhere we know that we like that's open on the Sunday. So on the Sunday we might have to forage for ourselves, which is, you know, clearly a travesty.

531
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:27,200
 I've been going through the, my diary for the weekend and thinking about what I normally do at the Easter Con and how I'm going to replicate that because I would not normally do any cooking over Easter weekend and I'm not intending to do any cooking next weekend.

532
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:37,200
 But I realised that one of the things that happens at Easter Con is about one in the morning I am often found in the bar and along with beer, which we have saw.

533
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:48,200
 I, there are often people there and I'm thinking of Michael Abbott and Malcolm Hutchison who sidle up to you at one o'clock in the morning and bar and say, would you like some chocolate?

534
00:44:48,200 --> 00:45:07,200
 So I am going to order the sort of chocolate that Michael might have, which is kind of the kind of dairy milk with bits in it type and the sort of chocolate that Malcolm might have, which is single varietal dark chocolate with Peruvian raspberries, that sort of thing.

535
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:16,200
 And, and have both of those sorts of chocolate available. So if I meet those people in the bar or, or if you think, oh, I would really like a bit of chocolate now, I can go and get it.

536
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:28,200
 And, and also I realised that about an hour later, like about two or two thirty is about the rat time that Tobe's comes around snogging people and I don't know what I'm supposed to do about that.

537
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:37,200
 Tobe's is lovely and he's a good kisser, but like, but yeah, I'm trying to work out ways in which you could replicate that experience in the comfort of your own home.

538
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,200
 Don't have any good ones.

539
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,200
 Yeah, buy some Calvados, that'll work.

540
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,200
 So maybe I need some Calvados actually, because he does also.

541
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,200
 And pistachio nuts.

542
00:45:49,200 --> 00:46:06,200
 Pistachio nuts. The most romantic breakfast I've ever had was the morning at East Taconne in 2008, where I woke up and Tobe looked at me and said, "With his breakfast" and then gave me a coffee spiked with Calvados and four pistachio nuts.

543
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:14,200
 And there were only seven pistachio nuts, so that was more than half of his pistachio nuts. And also I had been to breakfast and then gone back to sleep.

544
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,200
 With Tobe's, apparently.

545
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,200
 Yeah, well I used to share a room with Tobe's, because we could mate.

546
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,200
 Um, now I share a room with my wife, because we're also good mates.

547
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,200
 Yeah, but has she ever brought you coffee spiked with tap Calvados and four pistachio nuts? That's all I want to know.

548
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
 No, no she hasn't.

549
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,200
 But she did make me pancakes with chocolate chips in this morning.

550
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,200
 Banya if you're listening to this.

551
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,200
 Are we sure we want to blur the lines between Tobe's and this Banya in Chod's head?

552
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
 I mean, what do you mean, I don't understand?

553
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
 *laughs*

554
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,200
 Um, made out with both of them, had breakfast with both of them. Basically the same person is.

555
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
 Not going there, not going there.

556
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,200
 Was there anything else we were going to say in the podcast? I'm really looking forward to East Taconne.

557
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,200
 I am so excited for East Taconne. I am going to have such a good time at East Taconne. I am going to get so pissed at East Taconne.

558
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
 I'm going to be wankered.

559
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,200
 That's pissed in the UK sense of drinking too much beer, not pissed in the US sense of...

560
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,200
 Angry.

561
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,200
 Of angry because I've given up anger as you know readers.

562
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,200
 I am really excited. I'm hoping there will be loads and loads of cool people there and lots of fun interactions will happen.

563
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,200
 And we've also, we should mention as well, that there is a first Thursday pub meeting the night before East Taconne.

564
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:35,200
 So we don't know whether East Taconne is going to have anything on the Thursday night kind of officially.

565
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,200
 Because obviously...

566
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,200
 That's tonight, Pop Pickers.

567
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:48,200
 Yes. So if you are listening to this before 10pm British time, which is UTC+1 at the moment, then do come to the first Thursday.

568
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,200
 And you can get to the Facebook group through a link in the show notes.

569
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:59,200
 Yeah, you can. It's still for British fans and London, London and... Yeah.

570
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,200
 There's a lot of people who might be at the first Thursday the week before an Easter con, maybe.

571
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,200
 Yes. It's very much a meeting for the sort of people who might come to the London meeting on the first Thursday.

572
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:16,200
 Which is probably most of you if you were in London the night before the Easter conne and the Easter conne was also in London, for example.

573
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,200
 Yes. If you're coming to East Taconne, then definitely feel free to drop in to the first Thursday.

574
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:29,200
 And if you're not coming to East Taconne, but that's because you're grumpy rather than because you don't go to East Taconne's then also come and join the first Thursday.

575
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,200
 Or if you'd quite like a drink or if you like Thursdays, you know.

576
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,200
 I'm very bad at being exclusive.

577
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,200
 Yeah. So this is another thing about age has withered me.

578
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:50,200
 There is an issue that Mini-Con had where they woke up one morning and they had 3,500 people coming to their convention.

579
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:56,200
 And they were like, but we're all volunteers who are we organizing this for?

580
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,200
 And of course we are, in fact.

581
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,200
 And it's all very well for me to go.

582
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:07,200
 I am very happy for all my mates and all the listeners of my podcast to come to the first Thursday, which as it happens I organize.

583
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:16,200
 But in fact, I think because we drew that demarcation line around it that said it's for fans who might come to the first London fans.

584
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,200
 If you're in or near London, it's definitely for you.

585
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:26,200
 And fans who come to the first Thursday, who include some fans from a further field like Cambridge and Reading in Brighton.

586
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,200
 And fans who would definitely come to the first Thursday if they were around.

587
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:40,200
 But it's not in fact a meeting for every fan in the world because of the long term accretion overheads of that.

588
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:45,200
 I know that's really tedious, but that's kind of, and I wanted to draw a box around it that wasn't just,

589
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,200
 it's for me and my mates. I wanted to draw a box around it that included a lot of my mates,

590
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,200
 but was also actually saying, no, this is a geographically constructed thing.

591
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:02,200
 You know, if you don't have any friends who are London fans, but you obviously do have friends who are London fans who are listening to this podcast, but you know.

592
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,200
 Because we're your friends.

593
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,200
 But if it got huge, it would be less fun than it is just not being huge.

594
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,200
 That's all.

595
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:16,200
 That was the OctaThought Podcast, and it's goodbye from me.

596
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,200
 It's goodbye from me, and it's goodbye from me.

597
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,200
 So I came up with a poem.

598
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,200
 You came up with a poem?

599
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,200
 Yeah.

600
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
 Alright, you can do the poem for us.

601
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,200
 Hang on.

602
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,200
 I'm going to read the poem.

603
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,200
 I might need to write it down before I read it out in case it doesn't scan.

604
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,200
 Oh, John has written a poem live on OctaThought.

605
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,200
 I have my poem.

606
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,200
 [clears throat]

607
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,200
 Liz has a job. She can't come to the con.

608
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,200
 It makes her sob. The time zones are wrong.

609
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,200
 [clears throat]

610
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,200
 I don't know. We need like, sad violin music there.

611
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,200
 A poem.

612
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
 No, I think we need that.

613
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
 Wob wob wob. No, he's out there.

614
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,200
 That was the one.

615
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,200
 But in fact, we need just...

616
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:25,200
 Now we know that Alison can just hum the theme music instead of having to put an actual song in.

617
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:31,200
 Expect all future episodes of OctaThought to have entirely Alison-produced sounds.

618
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,200
 Do not do this.

619
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,200
 [laughs]

620
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:39,200
 The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin MacLeod at Ncompetech.com

 Beep.
