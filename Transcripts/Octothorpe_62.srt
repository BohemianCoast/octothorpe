1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
 We haven't actually finished our preparatory reading for the next episode.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,240
 I have, except for John, who's who gets a gold star.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,000
 Gold star for John.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,200
 Yay.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:29,400
 Hello, everyone, and welcome to the 62nd episode of Octa Thorpe, the podcast for

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,600
 science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 21st of July, 2022.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,560
 I'm John Coxson.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,960
 I'm Alison Scott.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,320
 And I'm Liz Batty.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,480
 And this is a unusual episode because we are recording it because we can't record

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,400
 next week a peek behind the curtain.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,160
 So we're going to talk about the Hugo Award finalists for Best Novel.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,760
 If you are very spoiler-verse, you may wish to save this episode for when you have

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,360
 read the finalists.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,280
 And if you are not, dive in.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,840
 Why not?

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,600
 And in the grand tradition of Octa Thorpe, you can, of course, feel free to listen to this

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
 episode in six months time and still send us a comment.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,720
 I guess this is a spoiler for our discussion, but none of these, I think, are books

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,560
 where spoilers are really going to be a big deal.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,960
 There's nothing where you are waiting, I think, for the final reveal, although I

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,320
 haven't finished one of the books.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,840
 So which does, in fact, have a kind of final twist or two.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,760
 So, you know, yeah, but the whole book is twisted.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,040
 It's all like revealing slowly things.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,640
 So.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,960
 So we're going to start off discussing Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir.

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,160
 Andy Weir, of course, is an author who catapulted to recognition for his work, The

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,040
 Martian, and the film of which won a Hugo Award at some point.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,520
 And this is his third novel, and it is about a man nailed this description.

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,400
 Yeah, I would say that Andy was first book.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,200
 The Martian was about a hyper-competent man left alone in space to spend the whole

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,000
 book being extremely competent at physics and discovering things from first principles

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,320
 and science, seeing the shit out of it.

35
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,240
 And Hail Mary is a book in which a hyper-competent man gets trapped in space alone,

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,400
 a long way from anywhere else, and spends a whole book science and the shit out of it

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,640
 with his body, who is very like him.

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,520
 Yes.

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,640
 So I think one of the things that is critical about this book is that it's got 10 times

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
 as many good reads, reviews as any of the books on the shortlist.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,720
 And quite a lot of those reviews say, Oh, God, this is Weir and it's Weir.

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,480
 It is very best.

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,320
 And it's even better than it was before because he managed just to introduce a completely

44
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,560
 alien alien that is not like any alien ever.

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,480
 And then they science the shit out of things together.

46
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,000
 And that is even better. And although I will grant you that the alien doesn't necessarily

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,400
 look like other aliens and Weir does quite a good job of explaining why that is.

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:07,280
 The alien is a middle aged or late 30s American man who is very good at science

49
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,000
 and likes to science to the shit out of things except he's more on the practical

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,800
 side of science rather than theoretical side of science.

51
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,040
 So what you have here is a theoretical scientist and an engineer.

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,200
 So obviously we've now covered all of the possible varieties of human and alien existence.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,880
 I think I disagree with several bits of that, though.

54
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,320
 He's particularly American.

55
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,440
 It did annoy me.

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
 He's gendered as a man given that presumably this alien does not have the concept of gender.

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,360
 We do. And like it would have been a very.

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,600
 They have a sexual reproduction that he chooses to he says, probably some other gender.

59
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,080
 I'm assuming he's a man and that is a problem and I have a problem with that.

60
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,080
 And like I have a problem with that way more than the implied middle agedness

61
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,280
 slash Americanism of him, which I think was much less clear than the implied manhood of him

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,360
 given that he has used him throughout.

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,800
 It just really annoyed me.

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,040
 I'm like, you could have just had.

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,520
 I grew up in the 60s and 70s.

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,520
 We used he and him to mean people all of the time.

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,600
 And you know, it was a thing then.

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,880
 I don't like how this book portrays gender.

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,840
 I think it is an own goal to decide that there is this alien and it would have been very easy

70
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,240
 in the point where he's like, I don't know what gender this alien is.

71
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,960
 I'm going to call it they and we had chooses not to do that.

72
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,960
 And I think that is annoying in 2022.

73
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,440
 And I am slightly sad that that approach was the one taken,

74
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,600
 especially because I think most of the rest of the books on the ballot do a really great job with gender.

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
 This sticks out as one that does not.

76
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,840
 I mean, I think the thing is it seems entirely in character for our main character to go.

77
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,960
 Well, maybe they say in, you know, has a different to a potential gender.

78
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,840
 I'm just going to call him he all the time because his innermost narrative voice basically

79
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,840
 seems like it spends absolutely no time thinking about anything that isn't science.

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,400
 So he's just going to be like, yeah, I don't care about that sort of stuff.

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
 It doesn't you can't measure it in like meters per second.

82
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,640
 It is exactly the same sort of misogyny that is rife in science.

83
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,960
 Generally, I think.

84
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,640
 Yeah. So I can get behind it.

85
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,120
 The thing is it doesn't really strike me as being a deliberate choice.

86
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,200
 It seems just like a sort of casual well.

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,400
 That's that's why I think, you know, it doesn't strike me as being an author's

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
 deliberate choice and which is just a kind of like throw away line and then he defaults to he because it's easier.

89
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,480
 I think it definitely reflects the thoughtlessness of the author.

90
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,840
 I would agree with that.

91
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,320
 OK, so this is only the third least thing I liked about this book.

92
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,280
 And I really enjoyed the book. I should say I read it all the way through without any difficulty.

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
 It's a perfectly pacy novel.

94
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,240
 It is founded on two pernicious lies, both of which are much worse than what pronouns you use.

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:54,320
 The first is the perception of dictatorial tyranny is the best way of dealing with a crisis.

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,560
 That if you have a crisis, the best way to sort it out is to find a strong

97
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,360
 personal and give them all the power and then solutions will follow.

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,400
 And that is what happens in this book in the first part of the book that's told in flashback.

99
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,360
 And the second and that's a lie.

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,320
 That's a comfortable lie that lots of people like, including lots of other people who like this book.

101
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,920
 And the second problem, which is even worse, if anything, is the belief that given any problem,

102
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,080
 the way to sort it out is for one person to use their kind of generalized understanding

103
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,520
 or maybe even two people to use their generalized understanding of things to tackle every problem

104
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,800
 as it comes up and solves it without any reference to anybody else.

105
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,120
 And that is possibly even more popular amongst readers of this book.

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,040
 So it's basically these are completely cozy things that are not true.

107
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,000
 This is not how any problems in the real world ever get solved.

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,120
 And if you put it into your book, yes, you've generated an escapist fantasy.

109
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,400
 But, you know, it's a terrible, it's a terrible way to write books.

110
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,440
 Come on, don't do it.

111
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,920
 And so it's really it's a book for 10 year olds.

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,640
 Oh, God, it's awful, terrible book.

113
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,840
 But I enjoyed it a lot.

114
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,560
 Has lots of funny things in it.

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,040
 We're writes his nerdy scientist quite well.

116
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
 Do you agree with that one?

117
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,640
 I think it does portray like, I mean, I haven't finished the book.

118
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,680
 So I am assuming that, you know, it turns out well and that, you know, giving one person the power

119
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,840
 to literally do anything to solve a crisis is the way that we should have solved it.

120
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,120
 But I think, yeah, more interesting is this portrayal of like the individual who can

121
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,200
 solve things and the book even kind of like tries to lampshade it.

122
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,080
 So there's a scene at the start where our hero protagonist who wasn't wasn't

123
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,200
 academic and then has gone back to be a high school teacher.

124
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,920
 I think so that he'll know all the stuff, you know, we need to know to teach high school

125
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,160
 science, which apparently equips you for, you know, being in deep space and solving

126
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,640
 all problems.

127
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,880
 Sorry, I'm digressing.

128
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,720
 You know, the scene at the start where they're like, OK, we want you to be the only person

129
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,600
 working with this new alien single-celled life that we have brought back.

130
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,360
 And the guy is like, but why why me?

131
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,320
 There's loads of other people and they try and like say, oh, we want you to be the

132
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,440
 guinea pig, you know, because you're expendable.

133
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,000
 And then if it turns out it kills everyone, you know, but it just seems like they're like,

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,120
 who should get this first?

135
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
 Oh, we've picked this one person and it doesn't feel like the way in which

136
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,120
 science would work or does work.

137
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,840
 And they nod towards it a bit because they then have a more international team, but it

138
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,440
 does seem to be very much like, yeah, this one person will have the skills to do

139
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,240
 everything they need to figure this whole thing out.

140
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,400
 When really, I think like what he's doing would be a team of 50 people.

141
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,960
 Well, Alison just said really concrete to me why I prefer the Martian to this book

142
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,600
 quite a lot, which is that in the Martian and like in other films like it like Apollo 13,

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,840
 it depicts the efforts of like a team of people to fix the problem because you have

144
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,040
 like the NASA aspect of things that are happening and you have the person stranded

145
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
 in space aspect of things that are happening.

146
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
 And both of those are very interesting.

147
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,480
 And obviously the sort of person that gets picked to go on a mission to Mars or

148
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,880
 in the case of Apollo 13, the moon is very competent at the things they need to do

149
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,560
 to get themselves out of tricky situations in space.

150
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,920
 Prodigy, how Mary doesn't really have that.

151
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,000
 And I do agree that that is that it is weaker for it because there's this myth of

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,920
 the kind of, I mean, this myth of the gentleman scientist, which is a gendered

153
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,000
 term, but basically kind of the idea that people work in a vacuum and solve all

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,040
 these problems and are very clever themselves.

155
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,880
 And modern science is not like that.

156
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,720
 It may have been like that in the past, but it is definitely not like that now.

157
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,920
 So the more you read about the history of science, the more you learn that wasn't

158
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,480
 ever the case.

159
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,800
 When I was taught genetics in school, I was taught about Mendrel, essentially,

160
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,440
 in a little greenhouse somewhere, breeding peas.

161
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,880
 And it was only, I think about five years ago that I learned that

162
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,760
 monasteries across Europe specialized in the area of scientific and other

163
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,520
 knowledge activity that they dealt with.

164
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,880
 And the monastery that Mendrel was in, which he was poached from another

165
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,160
 monastery to go to, specialized in breeding because sheep breed, it was a big

166
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,120
 sheep area.

167
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,520
 And he led a team of many, many, many monks engaged in the breeding of

168
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,760
 peas to get better peas.

169
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,320
 He was just the first person to work out what was going on.

170
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,240
 And I have not learned any of that in school because we have a myth of an old

171
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,760
 man pottering away in a greenhouse because he's a gardener or something.

172
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,200
 I am employed on something called a fellowship, which is entirely based around

173
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,680
 this lie, but it is also a lie that controls most of how science funding is

174
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,960
 done in the Western world.

175
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,160
 So it is a very, very prevalent lie.

176
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,120
 So Project Hail Mary, I also very much enjoyed.

177
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,680
 I thought it was good fun.

178
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,040
 I do like first contact stories and the part where he's working out how to

179
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,560
 communicate with an alien really scratched several of my itches around

180
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,400
 kind of language and first contact stuff in a way I really, really liked.

181
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:05,000
 So like, I will say that the floor for my Hugo ballot, because where is my sixth

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,680
 place choice?

183
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,080
 It's quite high because I did not hate this novel.

184
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,360
 We talk about the male gaze a lot.

185
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:17,200
 And this is a book that is written from the perspective of a prepubescent boy.

186
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,440
 This novel is very, very much has a 10 year old's conceptions of all sorts of

187
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,640
 things, but I think most notably a 10 year old's conception of sex.

188
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,120
 There's a, there's a kind of weird scene in which we have has decided he has to

189
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,240
 put some sex content in.

190
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,520
 Maybe told he has to put some sex content in.

191
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,000
 And, and the way he does it reminds me of the way that my children talked about

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,440
 sex when they were quite young, like five or six, you know, people are going to go

193
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,200
 and have sex now.

194
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,360
 That's a thing that they're going to do.

195
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,200
 And that's literally how it's handled here.

196
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:58,360
 And otherwise we see, we see none of the way that the main character relates in his

197
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,840
 relationship.

198
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,400
 So there's a much better book struggling to get out of here, which is the book

199
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:10,160
 about the person who cannot form adequate human relationships, who then has a really

200
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,000
 valuable interpersonal relationship with an alien who is completely unlike them.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,560
 But unfortunately, we don't really see the first part of that when they fail to

202
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,280
 handle human relationships properly.

203
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,200
 And we don't see a really alien alien for them to have a really valuable

204
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,080
 relationship with.

205
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,280
 So it could be better.

206
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,600
 Can I have one?

207
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,280
 I've got one mini round, if I may, which is for a book, which I'm pretty sure kind

208
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,400
 of all the physics is basically, I can't follow the physics, but I'm sure it is

209
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,720
 meticulously derived.

210
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,800
 I don't think the alien language makes sense.

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,520
 So the alien speaks in chords, right?

212
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,240
 And he speaks in chords of up to five notes.

213
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,960
 Fine.

214
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,560
 And we also get, but we also get hints that he's describing them as things like, oh,

215
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,120
 it's the A below C major.

216
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,720
 And, you know, he drops an octave.

217
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,760
 This is the alien speaking.

218
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,240
 He drops an octave when he's sad.

219
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,600
 And I'm like, OK, how many five note chords are there, you know, within a

220
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,680
 traditional octave, if we say that for some reason, the alien is using the same

221
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,960
 tonality as humans with a 12 note scale, how many chords are there that this guy

222
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,280
 is apparently managing to learn to understand language without having a laptop

223
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,040
 sitting in front of him?

224
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,440
 Because I'm pretty sure, even if you have perfect pitch, you're going to find

225
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,280
 that quite tricky and that there must be an upper limit on the number of words,

226
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,320
 which is, you know, a few thousand?

227
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,040
 Now, and this is part of the problem I had with the novel was that I really

228
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,240
 liked the initial bit where I'm like, oh, an alien that speaks in tones.

229
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,000
 That's a really interesting concept and learning how to understand that is really

230
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,400
 interesting.

231
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,720
 And then about halfway through the novel, it's just like, oh, it's solved.

232
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,720
 And it's like, oh, that is much less interesting because I do not believe that

233
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,080
 would happen.

234
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,560
 No, it's way too fast.

235
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,800
 I thought that was going to be the meat of the novel and like the whole novel

236
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,400
 is going to be a fascinating exploration of like, and then no, those, but

237
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,560
 like that quarter of the book, I did really enjoy.

238
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,000
 It didn't really mind learning language too quickly, which I'm sure is something

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,640
 that also happens in the martin is something in fact, it has happened already

240
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,440
 in the martin is something that I think you're allowed to have the free and

241
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,680
 first contact novels, because otherwise three years of accidentally getting stabbed

242
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,160
 because you've misinterpreted something is probably not that exciting.

243
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,640
 It depends, I think on the book, if you're a book, which is presenting this is very

244
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,720
 rigorously worked out and all very linearly extrapolated from what's possible.

245
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,880
 I have a lot less time for it than I do in the martin, which is not doing that.

246
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,960
 Only science in weir that is rigorously worked out is the things he expects

247
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,240
 people to remember from high school with a bit of a nudge.

248
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,280
 So nothing outside that space is ever is ever explained.

249
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:48,680
 Right. Shall we move on to the mass a master of gin by PJ L E Clark?

250
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,920
 This is the one I didn't finish because I didn't want to finish it.

251
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,800
 Liz can introduce this one.

252
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
 This really likes this one.

253
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,680
 I was to say, I really liked it or more that I disliked more of Sophia.

254
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,960
 The sort that's more than you two did.

255
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,160
 But yes, I think I probably liked it the most.

256
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,120
 So basically a master of gin by P.

257
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,040
 Jelly Clark is a novel of an alternate Cairo, essentially, where there are

258
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,360
 supernatural entities were released from their dimension kind of onto the world.

259
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,520
 And this has completely changed like the balance of power in our world at the

260
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,640
 start of the 20th century.

261
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,400
 And we follow a eventually an investigative agent named Fatma, who is

262
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,680
 investigating the murder of a secret brotherhood who seemed to be looking for

263
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,000
 relics from the man who opened this doorway into other dimensions.

264
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,760
 And of course, there's a strong supernatural element to it.

265
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,760
 So she ends up, you know, roaming around Cairo with her, you know, agent who's

266
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,240
 been assigned as her partner.

267
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,840
 And she's kind of rubbing up against this new partner that she's been assigned

268
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,320
 a mysterious girlfriend who is definitely more than meets the eye.

269
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,600
 And uncovering basically what happened to this brotherhood and what it's what it

270
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,200
 means to have to save Cairo from kind of the supernatural threat that is coming.

271
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,240
 Yep.

272
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,400
 I really liked this book.

273
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,160
 I found it to be, as they say, a page turner.

274
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,520
 I liked finding out what happened.

275
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,480
 I liked some of the concepts a lot.

276
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,640
 I liked the magic.

277
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,880
 Yeah, I really generally enjoyed it.

278
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,160
 And it makes me want to go back and read some of the preceding stuff in this

279
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,400
 world, because I know that there have been kind of, I've read the tram, the

280
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,640
 haunting of tram car zero or five, but I don't think I've read any other stories

281
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,440
 in this universe.

282
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,040
 So at some point I need to go and do that.

283
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,200
 I think there's only one other story actually in the universe.

284
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,800
 So you're nearly there.

285
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,720
 Oh, so I would have happily carried on reading this if I hadn't run out of time,

286
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,080
 but I didn't really like it very much.

287
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:02,040
 And that's because it's a police procedural set in a kind of fantasy city.

288
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,800
 And I feel I've read a lot of books like this before.

289
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,560
 And I find I feel like it was competent, but it wasn't really doing anything that

290
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,920
 wasn't beyond that. And I really didn't believe.

291
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:24,200
 So the central character is a hard bitten cop who works alone, right, who is also

292
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,600
 portrayed as being a young Muslim woman who is not very observant, as opposed to

293
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,200
 her assigned partner who is a much more observant Muslim.

294
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,600
 And I didn't believe in it.

295
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,640
 So I read it and I was like, well, this is just Travis McGee.

296
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,440
 You know, it has none of Clark is very pleased that he's got all these women

297
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,240
 in his thing, but none of them do any women things at all.

298
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,840
 So this is just a boy in a woman's suit.

299
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
 And I really, really didn't have any time for that.

300
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,920
 And when I was kind of going, I really didn't get into this book.

301
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,320
 Stephen said, well, you know, the problem is that the central characters

302
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,800
 don't ring true as women. And I was like, Oh, OK, so maybe it's not just me then.

303
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,560
 So if you're a woman and you really identified with Fatma, then do please tell

304
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,360
 me because I don't believe in that character at all.

305
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,720
 Yeah, there's not like I say, oh, then I disagree with Alison.

306
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
 And I really like the central character.

307
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,840
 I mean, yes, it is the kind of hard bitten detective.

308
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,520
 It's just that the hard bitten detective in this case is a woman.

309
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,240
 But I didn't have any problems with her not doing specific women things to tell

310
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,680
 me she was a woman. I'm quite happy with that.

311
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,840
 And young and cynical despite being young.

312
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,800
 Yeah.

313
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,480
 Well, and also, well, Liz is quite cynical despite being young Alison.

314
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,080
 So like I feel like that might have wrong true.

315
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,200
 She's much younger than Liz.

316
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
 She's like 28 or something.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,560
 Liz was quite cynical when this was 28 or something.

318
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,920
 I've known Liz for a while, Alison.

319
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,360
 Liz is a good egg.

320
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,560
 Maybe that's why I got along with Fatma so well, because I was like,

321
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,560
 also it's not the character I it's not the sort of character I

322
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,680
 tend to want to read about.

323
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,960
 It's more of a thing because police procedure, not my sort of book.

324
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,680
 That's a very different criticism, though.

325
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,840
 I would also say that, you know, in the setting, you know, it is rare for

326
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,320
 there to be female detectives.

327
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,480
 And so I think there's a lot of interesting stuff about one that she

328
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,400
 probably would be extremely cynical if you were in that position as a coping

329
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,240
 mechanism.

330
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,800
 And I do like that, you know, it is a cliche of, oh, the grisled

331
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,240
 detective is given, you know, I mean, she's not grizzled in age, but kind of

332
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
 grizzled in mentality is given the partner.

333
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
 She doesn't want.

334
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,520
 And then, you know, comes to a kind of understanding with them.

335
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,320
 But I did actually enjoy that sort of clash of approaches they had going.

336
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,200
 And I thought that was quite well done.

337
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,120
 I thought I definitely believed the thread in the novel where they

338
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,160
 don't get along at the start and they become more and more aligned through the

339
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,360
 book and I believed the arguments they have.

340
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,400
 And I believe the friction and then I believe it kind of aligning towards

341
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,600
 the end and the trust coming.

342
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,960
 And I thought that was actually quite well done.

343
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,760
 I did.

344
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,600
 I enjoyed parts of the mythology, but like, I don't know, for me, as we have

345
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,680
 discussed previously and as we will discuss later plots are a thing to hand

346
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,640
 characters around.

347
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,480
 So I was very much more focused on them just being awesome together, which I did

348
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,960
 enjoy.

349
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,440
 Ooh, also 1912.

350
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,240
 Did this feel like 1912 to you?

351
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,840
 Did this feel like a historical novel set in 1912 to you because it did not to me?

352
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,760
 Yeah, I mean, that's tricky, right?

353
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,600
 Because it isn't.

354
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,840
 It's an old history.

355
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,680
 I don't know.

356
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,720
 Like steampunk books.

357
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,440
 Like, I don't know how much a steampunk book needs to feel like it's

358
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
 Victorian because it isn't Victorian.

359
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,880
 So I don't know how much of a past to give it.

360
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,120
 I think the bits where there's a bit where Fatma kind of interact with real

361
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,800
 world characters given a kind of twist in this old history.

362
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,160
 And that I didn't, I thought that was on the weaker parts.

363
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,680
 That didn't really add much to me or feel particularly kind of completely

364
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,320
 thought through.

365
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,640
 But otherwise, I'm kind of happy to give everything a pass in a sort of like, oh,

366
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,200
 it's an old history, 1912, where, you know, things have progressed very quickly

367
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,120
 since they have this kind of supernatural power floating around everywhere.

368
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,640
 Yeah.

369
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,120
 So yeah, moved and bothered me.

370
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,160
 And there are definitely, I will definitely say there are better old histories.

371
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,320
 I do think it's probably easier to write old history that is within living memory.

372
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,120
 We can research history even before people were born, John.

373
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,640
 I mean, what outrageous.

374
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,920
 We know what detective novels written in 1912 were like, for example, you know,

375
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,200
 that there were plenty of them.

376
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,880
 It definitely didn't feel like a Sherlock Holmes book.

377
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,080
 Yeah, no, it didn't.

378
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,480
 It felt like a, it felt like a kind of mid century police proceduralist.

379
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,920
 Fine.

380
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
 I mean, I will finish this book now.

381
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,040
 I didn't, I don't want people to think I threw it aside.

382
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,040
 I threw it aside with good for brute force or anything.

383
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,280
 It's not that bad.

384
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,760
 As a fantasy, I enjoyed it very much.

385
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,920
 And I enjoyed it very much as a fantasy where you're using the old history basis

386
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,000
 to have like interesting things happening in Europe that haven't quite boiled over yet.

387
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,720
 I think that some of the geopolitics felt very cool and like Egypt positioning itself

388
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,080
 in that as a result of the fact that Egypt is like a magical superpower.

389
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,640
 That all felt really nice.

390
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,480
 And I don't know how you do that if you said it in modern times.

391
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,520
 So I do, I think the old history is more to get an interesting geopolitical

392
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,360
 situation than it is to explore what it was like to live in 1912.

393
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,000
 And I think that's valid because I think like you can pursue old histories

394
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,640
 for different reasons and pursuing it for that reason didn't feel like a

395
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,480
 pistach to me, if that makes sense.

396
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,240
 And it's very specifically in that time and place where we can explore kind

397
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,360
 of the colonialism of the great powers at the start of the 20th century.

398
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,600
 So I think that's a very like deliberate choice to explore that.

399
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,080
 I mean, and again, I think it's towards the bottom of my ballot, but again,

400
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,240
 I did enjoy it quite a lot.

401
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,560
 So, um, I will say I've just looked up the other books in the universe and I had

402
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,280
 got the impression of reading it that there would probably be loads of other

403
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,960
 stories that like all tied in.

404
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,160
 And there's like two, one of which I've read and the other one is a novelette.

405
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,520
 And I'm like, how you felt?

406
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,920
 Definitely like, I think, and this is probably to the credit of Clark.

407
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,640
 It felt like I was being dropped in media res into like a big universe that was

408
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,640
 already there and I was seeing a snapshot of it and it felt big.

409
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,920
 And looking at the universe, like the murder bot story, um, from last year,

410
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,800
 felt nowhere near as much of a massive universe that I was just seeing a glimpse

411
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,000
 of as this does despite the fact that there's been like four other books in that

412
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,640
 series.

413
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,080
 And this one is a much smaller series, but feels massive.

414
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,720
 And I'm like, I did quite enjoy the scale.

415
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,280
 I thought that was really cool.

416
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,880
 And I think that suits Cairo and like the geopolitics again.

417
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,400
 I think that that was neat.

418
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,600
 But it just confused me slightly when I was like, oh, there's just one novelette.

419
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,480
 Ha.

420
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,560
 Yeah, I was surprised to discover there was a novelette and I wasn't

421
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,360
 actually being dropped into the third or fourth novel involving these people.

422
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,720
 Cause, you know, it could have been, I think there are going to be more now.

423
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,920
 I think I think we are going to see this as a franchise-able product.

424
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
 Hmm.

425
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,880
 Um, I'm looking forward to the Netflix series.

426
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,400
 Is there a Netflix series?

427
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,040
 No, I just think there will be.

428
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,160
 So sort of thing.

429
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:32,360
 So next up, we're going to talk about the galaxy and the ground within.

430
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,400
 Alison, do you want to introduce this one?

431
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,240
 The galaxy in the ground within is the fourth of Becky Chambers Wayfarer's

432
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,320
 series and I haven't read any of the other ones.

433
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,360
 So, but people said, oh, it doesn't matter very much and I don't know whether it

434
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,480
 does or not.

435
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,960
 Um, Chambers says that this is a capstone for the series.

436
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:58,240
 So it kind of makes sense if you think of it as this is showing how the universe

437
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,800
 goes on after presumably the much more engaging events of the previous novels.

438
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,560
 But this is, I described it as a bottle episode of her, of her series.

439
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,760
 And I've seen other people describe it as the breakfast club with aliens, which

440
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,440
 is probably a better way of looking at it.

441
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,640
 You have some people who come together because they have been forced to stay

442
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,520
 together due to circumstances and they come from four different alien species.

443
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
 That's two of one.

444
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,240
 And they have the sort of conversations that you have when you're stuck in one

445
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,480
 place with people you don't know and send the bookends.

446
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,200
 So if you're looking for plot in your science fiction novels, it's, there's not

447
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,400
 a lot, but I'm not necessarily looking for plot.

448
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,080
 And I am totally up for a novel of interiority where people have a massive

449
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,880
 personal growth as a result of this sort of being thrown together.

450
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,360
 And you could have that with aliens.

451
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,360
 And I think that's a very interesting idea and I quite enjoyed it, but I'm not

452
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,640
 sure I don't think it's got enough character development even within that to

453
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,440
 sustain a novel.

454
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,800
 So I think this is very slight.

455
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,760
 I think if you like your science fiction to be very slight, then you'll probably

456
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,520
 like this quite a lot.

457
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,880
 And I definitely liked it more than the clock or the weir, but there's not enough

458
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,160
 to it.

459
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,520
 I think I will, I think I will say it is really interesting to see.

460
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,280
 So I will read this and assume that the previous books have like somehow got loads

461
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,800
 of plot in.

462
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,320
 No, like the first book is about a ship and it has some people on it and they

463
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,800
 talk a lot while some things happen.

464
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,120
 And then that's the end of the book, Bloody Love that book.

465
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,160
 The second book explores one of those characters and some other characters doing

466
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,000
 much the same thing.

467
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,320
 The third book explores a different one of the characters from the first book and

468
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,080
 some of those characters.

469
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,800
 And it doesn't even really explore one of the characters from the first book.

470
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,040
 It explores someone who knows one of the characters from the first book.

471
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,600
 And the link between the fourth book and the first book is the Ashby, who is the

472
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,160
 human with whom one of the characters is in love is one of the characters from

473
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,080
 the first book, that is the single tie.

474
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,720
 These are not like it's not some big crescendo and this is like a super chill

475
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,360
 capstone.

476
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,040
 They're all chambers.

477
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,600
 His style is very much focusing on character in small, not all that

478
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,200
 climatic circumstances.

479
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,360
 This is, I think, probably quite typical of her writing is not like unusual in that regard.

480
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,560
 Yeah, I have gathered this from my post, post reading analysis.

481
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,880
 I really like this book because I really liked the characters and I really

482
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,080
 liked watching them interact.

483
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:42,360
 But I completely understand why these books are quite divisive in the community.

484
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,680
 I'm definitely going to read all of her others.

485
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
 Really enjoyed it.

486
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,880
 Liz, do you want to talk about division in the community?

487
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,520
 Yeah, so I read the first of Becky Chambers's quarter to books and I didn't

488
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,240
 really like it.

489
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,720
 There's a bunch of characters who have a, you know, they do some talking and

490
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,120
 there's some like mild peril and it gets resolved and it's all happy at the end.

491
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,760
 And in this one, well, I mean, I think it was almost better than the first one

492
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,000
 because in the first one, it felt very much like she felt there had to be

493
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,160
 something going on.

494
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,080
 And so there were sort of things going on.

495
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,000
 And in this one, she's just decided, actually, I don't need anything to be

496
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,040
 happening other than there are some characters who are on a planet and they

497
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,160
 are, you know, talking to each other and we're learning about their

498
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,200
 characters and their species and stuff.

499
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
 And I mean, it's fine.

500
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,080
 If you want some aliens who, you know, described physically as being very

501
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:39,000
 alien, but in fact, you know, all talk like people in Sannevay much like people

502
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,120
 and they have some discussions and they clash mildly and then they mostly resolve

503
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,760
 them at the end and there's some nice bits.

504
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,880
 It's fine.

505
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,080
 But I didn't enjoy Chambers first book and I wasn't expecting to enjoy the

506
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,960
 fourth one and I didn't enjoy it.

507
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,560
 I don't know.

508
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,640
 I can't understand the appeal particularly because I think you could do a

509
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,680
 lot of this stuff.

510
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,600
 I think you can, I think you can tie character and plot together and I prefer

511
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,040
 books which do that.

512
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,760
 And this one is like, nah, I don't need to do that.

513
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,600
 I'm not going to bother.

514
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
 So very cozy.

515
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,560
 I guess if you had a book that did the inter-character stuff as well as this book

516
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,600
 and had like a really great plot, I would also very much enjoy this book.

517
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,600
 I do find that Chambers's approach to character is really good in a way that I

518
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,560
 think very few other writers manage.

519
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:32,320
 Like for instance, in the kind of other books in this category, I think the only

520
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,760
 one that gets close to doing the interpersonal stuff as well as this book

521
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,120
 does is the Martine is not a coincidence that the Martine is much higher up my

522
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,160
 like order of voting because I think it does do that.

523
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,480
 Melting plot and character work very, very well.

524
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,200
 But like I will say, I'm not sure any of the other books do the character work

525
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,160
 anywhere near as well as this novel does.

526
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,320
 The tension in this book arises firstly, because two characters get into a

527
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,080
 political argument and the book has been so cozy up to that point.

528
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,000
 You're shocked when this happens.

529
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,360
 And then secondly, they immediately set aside their differences to work on a

530
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,840
 common crisis.

531
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,800
 So in the Martine, there's a scene very early on where two characters have

532
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,320
 actual political differences that matter to the bigger picture story.

533
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:31,200
 And then immediately afterwards, one of them immediately lets that go because

534
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,680
 something excites them scientifically and they need to use their scientific

535
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,120
 knowledge to solve the problem, which they do, thereby showing scientists working

536
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,800
 together to solve something.

537
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,720
 And it's just a, I don't think the characterisation is notably worse than in

538
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,640
 the chambers, and b, that occupies about two pages of the book.

539
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,640
 So I feel that the chambers also has a thing about lack of density in terms of

540
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,120
 a science fiction novel, that this is a novel for some, for people who like their

541
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,360
 levels to not get, not do very much, or not require very careful reading either.

542
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,600
 Because if you read the Martine at the speed at which I read the chambers, you

543
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,520
 would, you would miss about 95% of what's going on in it.

544
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,960
 The Martine has used amounts of glances and people saying things they don't quite

545
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,360
 mean and chambers does this, but it's all much more spread out.

546
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,160
 I quite, I, I, I've ranked the, I've ranked the chambers third in my big

547
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,880
 list of books for the Hugos.

548
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,800
 I did quite enjoy it.

549
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,760
 I think I enjoyed it better than three of the others.

550
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,000
 What did you say, Liz?

551
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,880
 You just said you'd like your books to have some plot in them?

552
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,960
 Yeah, pretty much.

553
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,840
 I mean, the thing is, I'd like my books to have plot and character.

554
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,200
 Ideally, and if it has a little plot of the chambers, I need the character to be

555
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,040
 more.

556
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,520
 Yeah, it's more that I just can't see what.

557
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,160
 Like, it's tricky.

558
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,040
 Like, sometimes you can't, it's very difficult to predict the bits of a book

559
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,680
 that will work well on the bits that won't.

560
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,000
 Well, I went away from this thinking I will read a lot more chambers.

561
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,800
 I'm going to read it all.

562
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,320
 It's great.

563
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,040
 I might read, maybe the sort of books I read in the bath or on airplanes.

564
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,880
 I read a long way to a small angry panel on my honeymoon on the beach in

565
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,760
 Korsaika, and it was 10 out of 10 for that use case.

566
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,600
 But yeah, I will say that the long way, the long way for a small

567
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,120
 angry planet did make me want to throw it across the room.

568
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,440
 And this one did not make me want to throw it across the room.

569
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,360
 I think she has grown as a writer and it feels much more developed as a

570
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,560
 novel, whereas the one way to a small angry planet felt incredibly episodic.

571
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,320
 That was one thing I really didn't like about it.

572
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,960
 It felt like six episodes of a TV show kind of jointed together.

573
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,240
 So yeah, the problem is it's clear that she has grown into a writer that I don't

574
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,120
 get along with.

575
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,200
 So which is like entirely fair.

576
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,360
 I could definitely see that this is a very specific style of book.

577
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,200
 And I can appreciate why there are people who like it and people who don't.

578
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,520
 The interesting thing about it to me is that the two writers on this list,

579
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,000
 who are the writers that people come up to me who are not in our community and say,

580
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,280
 have you read X because I know you like science fiction, our chambers and we're.

581
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,520
 They're the two writers that have really burst out of our community and are working

582
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,520
 like with people who do not follow like all the stuff we talk about.

583
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,280
 And so clearly they are doing things that like people like, but clearly not.

584
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,560
 Because I don't think spoilers this is.

585
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,320
 I don't think either of these books are going to win the Hugo.

586
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:33,120
 So yeah, clearly not in the world con kind of niche, clearly not as well received.

587
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
 But it is interesting.

588
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,760
 I bet they're selling a lot of books to non science fiction fans, but not the same

589
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,520
 non science fiction fans as well.

590
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,400
 I bet the people who are saying, Oh, I love the Becky shabers and not the same

591
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,280
 people who say, you know, I love Andy Weir.

592
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,240
 That is true.

593
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,040
 I think.

594
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,720
 Am I be wrong?

595
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,840
 I think it is.

596
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,080
 They should collaborate.

597
00:33:53,080 --> 00:34:03,520
 I'm going to introduce she who became the son.

598
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,120
 I was going to say speaking of books I wanted to throw across the room harshly.

599
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,800
 Yeah.

600
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,040
 Alison Alison didn't get along with this one Liz.

601
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,920
 But it ended up as my third.

602
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:18,200
 So she who became the son, she who became the son is a book by Shelley Parker Chan.

603
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,480
 It is the first book by an Australian author on the Hugo ballot.

604
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,400
 First best novel, the finalist from an Australian.

605
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,080
 So therefore it has broken out a little bit in Australia and it's getting read by a

606
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,000
 lot of people because of that, which quite not to do.

607
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,920
 She who became the son by Shelley Parker Chan is a book, which is about a monk

608
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,920
 called Zhu Chongba or are they called that?

609
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,720
 Basically, there is a young girl who lives in a village and is a time of famine

610
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,720
 and everything is very bad and bandits kill her dad and her brother.

611
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,400
 And she assumes the identity of her brother in order to secure her fate.

612
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,920
 And she goes on an adventure.

613
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,320
 She becomes a monk and then she gets an army and then lots of other things happen.

614
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,240
 I've nailed this description.

615
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,040
 It's a surprisingly difficult thing to talk about because I enjoyed it.

616
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,600
 But from my perspective, not much happened because she was much the same

617
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,840
 person at the beginning that she was at the end.

618
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,680
 And really, like, no one really changes.

619
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,840
 And like it just felt like I was reading the same passage, but about different

620
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,320
 battles repeatedly, which I liked and it was well done.

621
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,400
 And some of it was like some of the joining bits were very interesting.

622
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,720
 But yeah, found it a little bit long and a little bit repetitive.

623
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,600
 And it took me the longest of all of the books to read.

624
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,360
 I think it's fair to say, which instead didn't like it.

625
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,120
 But I liked it less than all the others except the we're.

626
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,480
 Liz had it as a pick many episodes ago.

627
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,280
 It was a pick.

628
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,440
 She did.

629
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,760
 And we ignored her like fools.

630
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,400
 I was excited to read it there by.

631
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,320
 I thought the opening was fantastic.

632
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,160
 I've seen this described as misery porn, but I quite liked it.

633
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,160
 I was really excited by this book after the first chapter in which terrible things

634
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,400
 happen. John said she was trying to fill her fate.

635
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,560
 But what she does is adopts her brother's fate as a deliberate thing that her

636
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,560
 brother was told by some fortune teller that he was destined for greatness and then

637
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,880
 dies. So she decides that greatness is a thing that you can go and get.

638
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,480
 And then she goes and gets it.

639
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,680
 So I really, really liked that bit.

640
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,840
 And then she goes off and has a kind of an absolutely terrible growing up in a

641
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,320
 monastery section, which is passing for a boy's section, which is just awful.

642
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
 It's big in awful in big ways.

643
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,560
 It's awful in small ways.

644
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,960
 I was like, this book is terrible.

645
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,680
 Everything about this book is terrible.

646
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,840
 I cannot cope.

647
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,120
 And then once it gets out of that bit, she then has the first bits of leadership

648
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,120
 where the plot get, you know, she does a thing where she's like, she forces an

649
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,080
 avalanche to happen.

650
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,360
 And my disbelievers, suspenders went spun at this point.

651
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,200
 I was, this is complete, Tosh, that, you know, there has never been so much

652
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,040
 Tosh written in a novel as I am reading here right now.

653
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,600
 Come on.

654
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,840
 And then after that, I kind of got into a bit of more and quite liked it.

655
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:24,640
 When I heard that the author had been inspired by Chinese dramas, I was kind of

656
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,320
 like, well, I can see a bit of that because I think they have a lot of this.

657
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,720
 Complete nonsense in them.

658
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,800
 And, you know, when I kind of got on with that bit a bit, but in fact, there's, there's

659
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,000
 actually less of it when she actually gets into the big politic stuff.

660
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,360
 It's not as bad, but it's still not good.

661
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,400
 And anyway, except that the overall conception of it, I ended up quite liking.

662
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,600
 And it's better than the chambers because unlike John, I think stuff does happen

663
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
 in this novel.

664
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,680
 And I think characters do develop, not necessarily her.

665
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,680
 I like the B plot quite a lot.

666
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,440
 Um, with the, um, with the other, the other side.

667
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,880
 And I quite liked it.

668
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,120
 But it took a lot of going.

669
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,560
 I would never have had I not been doing Hugo reading.

670
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,440
 I would not have read.

671
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,040
 I would not have picked this up, book up.

672
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,800
 I would not have read it, but I definitely wouldn't have finished it.

673
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,320
 So, you know, but still quite like some of it, but I had to set aside a big

674
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,240
 pile of nonsense.

675
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,960
 That's the big reservations.

676
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,120
 I think I've said bigger reservations on this one.

677
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,480
 So this is a book that some giving it some points for trying to do something

678
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,000
 epic and not quite getting there because I like books that try to do epic things.

679
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,560
 Yeah, I like to.

680
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,520
 I'm not sure.

681
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,200
 Yeah, I can't pinpoint exactly why you're saying some bits and nonsense,

682
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,720
 them to make sure.

683
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,720
 OK, but I mean, what I liked about it is I think one, it is following kind of a

684
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,640
 historical, you know, using a historical backdrop that I haven't seen done that often.

685
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,440
 And using it in a way which I think does a lot of interesting stuff about gender

686
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,400
 and gender roles and especially, you know, when you say you doesn't change,

687
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,520
 I think that what she does is kind of it almost feels like she is in some ways

688
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,440
 unchanging, but in some ways kind of adjusting what she learned as a child and

689
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,640
 realizing kind of like what she has to hide in order to be successful as a man.

690
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,360
 And maybe the fact that she has a very strong sense of her own identity and the

691
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,040
 fact that she's going to take this fate and she's going to make this fate hers is

692
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,640
 kind of interesting thing about her.

693
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,720
 And I really liked how that, you know, it contrasts like she feels like she's

694
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,040
 never kind of comfortable being a man, but it doesn't feel like she would have

695
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,400
 been entirely comfortable in the role of a woman and how much of that is her and

696
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,040
 how much of that is the gender roles society she's in.

697
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,400
 And then you contrast that kind of with the opposing, opposing general

698
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:54,320
 Aoyang, who has another completely different take on kind of gender roles and sexuality.

699
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,840
 And I thought that was like by far the most interesting part about the book.

700
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,400
 If that had not been there, then I agree that maybe I would have not really wanted

701
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,520
 to read it just as a sort of straight historical fantasy if it was about a peasant

702
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,840
 boy, you know, rising to to power and the, you know, the general who opposes it.

703
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,760
 But with that put on top of it, I really enjoyed it.

704
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,920
 I will say, I think the character development or the character manipulation of

705
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,320
 the B plot in the enemy camp was I did enjoy those bits.

706
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,520
 I didn't have a problem with the avalanche because I don't think she does it on purpose.

707
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,120
 She raised her the gods and then she does a thing and I don't know, it's open to

708
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,160
 in separateation, I guess.

709
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,000
 But yeah, I didn't, I didn't mind that.

710
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,240
 I see all of the points you've made and I recognize that they're probably well done.

711
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,400
 But like it did.

712
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:50,760
 I never got excited to read more of this novel, which is why it is towards the bottom of my

713
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,280
 do.

714
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,560
 And also it is the first in a series and I have no inclination to pick up the second

715
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,880
 or the third or the fourth.

716
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,080
 So when Park Chan does another series doing something different in a different

717
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,240
 place, I'll go and read the first of those, I think.

718
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,200
 I think, yeah, and I think it ends pretty well.

719
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,880
 Like I didn't feel like the cliffhanger is anywhere near as bad as some other cliffhangers.

720
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,800
 I've seen, but also I, and maybe I'm wrong, I assumed its first half of a duology.

721
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,760
 I assume in the next book, you will become the emperor.

722
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,600
 And I might be wrong, but that's kind of, it felt very much to me like part one of a two-part

723
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,800
 story in a way that I can't quite quantify.

724
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,200
 But if anyone knows, write in listeners.

725
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,560
 It's a duology, apparently.

726
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,840
 There you go.

727
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,600
 Oh, OK.

728
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,200
 Hey, see, I'm good at books.

729
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,160
 Trivial Superpower is detecting how long a series is from the first book.

730
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,960
 I agree with our listen.

731
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,680
 It is a little bit long and it does get a little bit repetitive.

732
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,520
 But I wonder if that was partly based on, you know, whatever historical structure is

733
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,440
 there that you kind of feel there's a bunch of like historical events you have to

734
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,720
 tick through.

735
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,080
 One or so, I wonder whether because if it is based in, because I knew it was based,

736
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,040
 I know it's like the author wanted to do like a queer Chinese kind of story.

737
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,400
 But if it is specifically based on Sea Dramas, maybe part of that comes from kind

738
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,920
 of the structure of television and television episodes, because now when, as

739
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,680
 soon as I can remember, was it Alison or Liz who said that that was one of the

740
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,160
 influences?

741
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,640
 I can't remember.

742
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,120
 Sorry, listeners.

743
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,720
 Sorry, people.

744
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,480
 It was me, I think it was Alison, but I would agree with Alison.

745
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
 It does feel like the Sea Drama influence on it.

746
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,560
 So then that really made me think, oh, maybe the repetition I felt was the kind

747
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,400
 of influence of a kind of television structure on the novel.

748
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,240
 Because I don't, I suspect it wasn't conscious, but I wonder whether that kind

749
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,400
 of that style of plot be, if it came from the television, that would make a lot of

750
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,320
 sense to me in my head.

751
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,280
 Yeah, having that sort of like reversal of fortunes.

752
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,200
 I started feeling a lot more charitable about it when I learned that she was

753
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,680
 influenced in influence of Sea Drama is trying to bring some of that because I

754
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,560
 don't think there is enough of that in SF of fantasy.

755
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,840
 So in the end, I like, I ended up liking it a lot more than I had when we went

756
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,160
 through.

757
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,440
 I think I have a general cross cutting point about the dead hand of plots in

758
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,720
 novels, which in, in the weir is in the body of the, what's her name, Stratt,

759
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,360
 the woman who jerks the plot around to suit her.

760
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:29,440
 And in this one is the fate that drags the plot around.

761
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,280
 And, and authors should hide when they're being authors a bit better than either

762
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,880
 of these two novels.

763
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,600
 I'm not sure I wholly agree with that because I think it's kind of the other

764
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,640
 way round, but I know what you mean.

765
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:50,480
 Light from Uncommon Stars by Rika Yuki.

766
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,640
 And this is a book about a violinist getting some violin lessons.

767
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,760
 So no, this is a book.

768
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:04,280
 Primarily, I think about what it is to make things and what it is to be part of

769
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,920
 a community and what it is to be authentic.

770
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:12,160
 And it is a book about how you balance the pressures of who other people want

771
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,480
 you to be with the pressures of who you actually are.

772
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,960
 I very much enjoyed it because I really thought the ways it talks about those

773
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,480
 themes were things I found really interesting.

774
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,280
 And they are things that I care about quite a lot.

775
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,800
 Like basically I'm the sort of idiot who like you be like,

776
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
 where do you want to get dinner, John?

777
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,040
 And I'm like, well, I'd all go there.

778
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,400
 That's a chain restaurant.

779
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,200
 I think a lot of the considerations in here about kind of small community

780
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,800
 endeavors versus kind of other approaches really resonate with me as a result.

781
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,320
 So I think this book was probably kind of probably pandering to me a little bit.

782
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,040
 But I did very much enjoy it.

783
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,880
 I also very much enjoyed the description of kind of being trans and how that

784
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,000
 intersects with how that intersects with sexuality.

785
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,080
 And kind of I really thought that was really interesting because obviously I

786
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,240
 don't have that perspective.

787
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,880
 And so seeing that perspective kind of on the page was really, I thought was

788
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,840
 really kind of nice to see.

789
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,440
 So yeah, in general, very much enjoyed this one.

790
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,960
 This is the second on my ballot as a result.

791
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,360
 I kind of go back and forth on this one because I think it does some things

792
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,400
 very well.

793
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,520
 Like I agree with John, it's got all those themes and it's got kind of like,

794
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,960
 yeah, how do you find your identity and keep your identity, particularly in

795
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,840
 immigrant communities in a community of maybe people who are like yourself or

796
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,640
 unlike yourself?

797
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,800
 I just felt kind of it.

798
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,160
 It did that really well at the start.

799
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,520
 And then I'm not sure it really expanded upon it into making a satisfying

800
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,440
 novel.

801
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,040
 I mean, we should say that there is there is some plot going on here, which is

802
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,720
 that there is a woman who made a deal with devil to sell the souls of violin

803
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,840
 prodigies to them.

804
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,480
 And so she is, she finds Katrina that the violinist who is going to be her

805
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,520
 seventh soul that she will sell and reclaim herself from damnation.

806
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,400
 Yeah, I never did think that would happen, not for one minute.

807
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,320
 Spoiler.

808
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,800
 No, that's the thing.

809
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,040
 She sort of that that's obviously never going to happen because it's in many

810
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,160
 ways a very sort of sweet book.

811
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,760
 And you can't imagine ever that, you know, Katrina, who has overcome

812
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,520
 so much to live the life she wants to live is going to end up having her soul

813
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,160
 soul to the devil for all time.

814
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,320
 Yeah.

815
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:28,120
 It's not as sweet as the chambers, I should say, if you're considering the

816
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,920
 sugar content of novels, then the chambers is definitely top of Alice.

817
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,080
 Well, it's absolutely not as sweet as that because before the novel even

818
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,360
 starts, she's had a massive amount of trauma and she continues to have that

819
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,560
 at the start of the novel and she finds essentially this safe, safe haven, which

820
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,520
 is not really a safe haven because it's with the woman who's really looking

821
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,640
 for a seventh soul to sell to the devil.

822
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,640
 It's just I really liked the first bit and then I felt it just kind of like

823
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,880
 kept going and then eventually ended.

824
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,240
 And there's some sort of subplots of feel like unsatisfactory resolved, like

825
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,440
 the woman becoming the violin repair person that she was always told she

826
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,720
 couldn't be and things like that.

827
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,040
 Never just sort of never seemed to kind of end up anywhere.

828
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,280
 Does that make sense?

829
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,520
 I love this book with reservations, which I'll get to.

830
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,720
 I I'm interested in John's conception of it because I don't think this book is

831
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:29,560
 quite as sweet as it makes out because it is a great big everything donut of a

832
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,040
 novel.

833
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,560
 I didn't say it was sweet.

834
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,880
 I think I said that.

835
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,400
 I didn't entirely get it as being a novel about community in one's place in it.

836
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,720
 So much as I thought it was a novel about families, both biological and chosen

837
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:51,000
 families and the sorts of abuse that arises in those families, even when you

838
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,080
 don't necessarily intend for it to.

839
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,360
 And that that was the thing that over, you know, that seemed overarching to me,

840
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,680
 which was not sweet.

841
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,880
 I thought it was extremely careful and there were multiple examples of it and

842
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,240
 they were all very well done.

843
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,680
 And I thought it's great because it's doing this hilarious story about a kind

844
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,920
 of demon and violence and space aliens and this and that.

845
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,280
 It is a great big everything donut of a book.

846
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,800
 Far too many seems have been put into this book and some of them come out right

847
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,520
 and some of them don't, but it keeps this lightness of tone while dealing with

848
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,280
 some extremely troubling things.

849
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,720
 And I really, really liked that, but I have some reservations about it, which I

850
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,280
 can go to, but it's still my second choice book by Miles because I thought it

851
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,440
 was doing something really different and I liked books that are different.

852
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,480
 Little reservations and they are quite small.

853
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,720
 At the end of the book, Katrina, who is the violinist, her plot arc gets

854
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,120
 wound up substantially before the end of the novel, which then goes off and

855
00:48:54,120 --> 00:49:01,040
 talks about her mentor and the space aliens and they get the end of the book.

856
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,840
 And I don't think that's entirely deserved.

857
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,960
 And there is a bigger problem with it in that it's busy being a feel good

858
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,960
 novel about finding your own identity and living with it.

859
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,360
 But characters in this book are doomed to health for all eternity.

860
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:20,000
 And the people who do that don't get brought to bear for doing that.

861
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,600
 And there's another thing in which two teenagers get murdered and characters

862
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,520
 who we left as being who presented us to being positive wholesome characters

863
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,560
 clean up the mess and nothing more is done about it.

864
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,520
 And in both of those cases, I was like, you can't have that stuff in this book.

865
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,160
 So it felt underendated to me because I feel like a reputable editor would have

866
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,200
 gone, come on, you've got to sort this out.

867
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,600
 And you could perfectly well sort it out.

868
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,160
 That's why they're minor reservations.

869
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,320
 I go, yeah, no, I can see how you could get around both of those things.

870
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:56,880
 I think you might be right about the violin lady and the mentor and the

871
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,400
 aliens getting the end of the book, because I do think it is really Katrina's story.

872
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,320
 And one of the things I wanted to say to you, so you said it was unbelievable

873
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,120
 that the mentor would sell Katrina's soul.

874
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:12,960
 It is really notable to me that at no point does she actually sell a soul.

875
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,880
 She in every case basically says to them, you can sell your soul and you will be.

876
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,560
 You will have all the fame you want.

877
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,920
 And she is selecting people who want the fame.

878
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,920
 When their children as a result of grooming, well, no, they don't.

879
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,040
 They make the decision as adults.

880
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,960
 As a result of grooming.

881
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,680
 Yeah.

882
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,960
 But there's a clear thing here, which is that Katrina gets asked the question.

883
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,400
 She says, no, initially.

884
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,120
 And then she says, yes, when she realized that saying no means that the mentor will be

885
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,480
 damned. And she makes that decision because she wants to trade her soul for the mentors.

886
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,000
 And then the book kind of engages in a little bit of chicanery and makes it all

887
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,880
 okay on both counts, which, you know, I actually quite liked it.

888
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,480
 Like I was glad that they resolved it.

889
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,800
 It felt like less of a cop up than it might have done.

890
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,160
 There was still a little bit of a cop out equally.

891
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,920
 I'm not necessarily all that bothered by cop outs in media because return of the Jedi

892
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,080
 is my favorite Star Wars movie.

893
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:13,160
 But I do think like, and you're entirely right about the grooming, but I think the book

894
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,160
 attempts to kind of distance itself from the horror of what she's doing by by kind

895
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,200
 of employing that strategy.

896
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,680
 I am not sure the extent to which I think the book really grapples with that.

897
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,000
 And I don't know whether, like you said, the thing about the two kids getting murdered,

898
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,720
 like the character who does the murder is punished, but like not with anything approaching

899
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,200
 due process. So that's a problem.

900
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,920
 And so like, yeah, there are bits in this book where I'm like, yeah, maybe you didn't

901
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
 need that plot beat.

902
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,760
 The central thing of the book being like, the problem is that when a civilization

903
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,960
 reaches significant enough size, they all just realized that life is entirely pointless

904
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,680
 and everything just goes to hell.

905
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,160
 I was like, oh, that is an interesting concept.

906
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,360
 And I really, really enjoyed that.

907
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,800
 And I feel like I want to read a book that is much more about that because that was

908
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,760
 an idea.

909
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,600
 Well, when I talk about this being a bit of an everything book, there's so much here.

910
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:12,200
 There are so many fizzing ideas that you could have spun a novel off.

911
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,040
 Yeah.

912
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,560
 And it would have been good if somebody had said to Aiki, well, maybe, maybe you could

913
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,360
 just sort of tighten the boundaries of this little bit.

914
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,680
 No, very excited by this book, very excited by the possibilities in it.

915
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,720
 Enjoyed it a lot.

916
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,320
 Yeah, definitely my second choice of these.

917
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,200
 Yeah.

918
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,160
 So I mean, you have picked up one of the things I had a problem with.

919
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,560
 Basically, I think it feels a little uneven kind of the sections where it feels

920
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,440
 very little moves on.

921
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,040
 And then we do have this segment where, yes, as you say, one of the aliens who is

922
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,280
 being bullied by some random teens decides the best way to respond to that is to go

923
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:47,960
 and murder them.

924
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,520
 And then like his family responses, oh, we'll clean it up and we'll never tell

925
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,240
 anyone what happened and we'll just put you in stasis to deal with later.

926
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,160
 And then that's kind of it.

927
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,240
 It's kind of an astonishing thing to happen in the middle.

928
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,920
 And I had to double check, you know, because I read five pages and I was like, did they

929
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,600
 really just do that?

930
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,160
 And they did.

931
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,000
 Yeah.

932
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,200
 So I felt that quite shocking.

933
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,240
 And I think like that kind of exemplified what I feel about the book, which is it sort

934
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,280
 of drops these nuggets of these nuggets of things like that.

935
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,160
 Or like, like as John said, the giant idea about when civilizations will will collapse.

936
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:25,760
 And then I'm not sure it kind of completely follows through with them.

937
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,040
 Um, I, so I did enjoy kind of big chunks of it.

938
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,600
 And I think it does have some good characters.

939
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:36,840
 And I liked a lot of the setting and, you know, the lot of great descriptions of a

940
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:42,080
 food and the importance of food and the importance of, you know, what, how food

941
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,000
 makes you feel.

942
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,880
 Oh, I loved all that.

943
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,440
 But I think then it's like, actually, maybe it does that one too many times.

944
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,800
 They go to about six different restaurants and say, and this restaurant

945
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,760
 serves this food and it makes people feel, you know, reminded of their home or

946
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,800
 reminded of, I thought Aiki probably writes in noodle bars.

947
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,960
 I'm not sure that I thought that because the bit where the bit where the alien

948
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,480
 kills the teens is clearly like radicalization thing, right?

949
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,160
 Like the, you see the team being radicalized through the novel, like in favor of

950
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,520
 this kind of imagined homeland and he like started becoming more and more and

951
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,720
 more jingoistic and then eventually culminates with this horrible thing.

952
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,880
 And they're basically like, Oh, no, this is a problem.

953
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,160
 And they, and they stasis him.

954
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,440
 And I did think that was an abrupt end.

955
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,560
 And I think, you know, I wonder whether you could have told that same, you had

956
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,280
 that same narrative thread, but without quite the abrupt end that it ends up having.

957
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,600
 But I will, I think I disagree with the civilization ending nihilism not following

958
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,600
 through, because I think one of the interesting things about it is that it

959
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,120
 does follow through in the characters, like the conversations that the

960
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,480
 head alien and the violin lady have are, I think, exploring that from a very

961
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,200
 character focused and carrying that theme through to the end of the book with a

962
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,680
 very character focused thing rather than a very plot focused thing.

963
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,120
 And I, I actually really enjoyed that, especially because I think the, the

964
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,840
 perspective of the violin lady basically comes to his, well, if nothing matters,

965
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,880
 then we get to define our own existence.

966
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,080
 And this is not a problem for me.

967
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,840
 And the aliens like, there.

968
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,520
 And I, I really like that.

969
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:17,080
 Because like, I am a nihilist, but not a nihilist who thinks that nihilism is

970
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,000
 a reason to give up.

971
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,800
 If that makes sense, I've always been like nothing matters.

972
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,880
 So everything I do has the meaning I attach to it.

973
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,760
 And that means I have to be careful what I do.

974
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,280
 And I have to put like things I like into the world because there's nothing else

975
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,080
 that will do that for me because there is literally no reason or meaning in the

976
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,600
 universe.

977
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,160
 And so I've always felt that to be freeing.

978
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,200
 And I really enjoyed the way this book talks about it.

979
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:46,440
 I think this book comes very close to explicitly saying that human art and

980
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:53,680
 music and possibly also doughnut making are the things that will, that could not

981
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,280
 just cure the, what's it called, the existential plague?

982
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:58,960
 Yeah.

983
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,200
 For everybody, not just for humanity.

984
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,360
 That's the, the, the point that the book comes to on this.

985
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:13,480
 When I think the book is arguing that making stuff is what makes meaning in the

986
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,280
 universe.

987
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,400
 And it would be hard to argue with that.

988
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,000
 And I think I mostly agree with that as a person who makes a thing.

989
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,840
 So yeah.

990
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,400
 Yeah.

991
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,520
 I think several parts of this book actually resonate with me.

992
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,120
 And, and actually I thought a lot of the themes were very similar to everything

993
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,040
 everywhere at once.

994
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,480
 That's why I mentioned the everything, donut.

995
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,080
 Yes, it was a good, it was a good joke.

996
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,960
 Liz, do you want to set us on the home run?

997
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,800
 Home straight.

998
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:54,800
 OK, so our final book is a designation called Peace by RK Martin, which is the

999
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,920
 second book in her takes Kalan series.

1000
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,800
 I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly.

1001
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,800
 Anyway, so what is going on here is we were left at the end of the first book

1002
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:11,440
 with an empire where kind of the overthrow of the empire had narrowly been

1003
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,560
 filed and we have a new emperor in place.

1004
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:18,160
 And two of the characters who were heavily involved in that, we have three

1005
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,080
 seagrass, essentially an information

1006
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:29,320
 analyst and Mahit Dismar, who is an ambassador from a space station that is

1007
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,840
 not part of the Takes Kalan empire, but has a kind of very uneasy piece with it.

1008
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:39,880
 They end up as part of a conflict with another alien race, which is lurking on

1009
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,520
 the edge of their space and no one can communicate with it.

1010
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:48,200
 And it's kind of about how this war or conflict unfolds.

1011
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:54,800
 And strategically how this conflict is being used by all the different players

1012
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:02,520
 in this empire and by this station that isn't part of the empire, but it has its

1013
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,360
 own agenda, how they're kind of using this war and manipulating information

1014
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:11,720
 and manipulating the politics of the situation to each get their own ends and

1015
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:17,560
 how essentially three seagrass and Mahit come in and mostly disrupt that by being

1016
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,680
 themselves. Yeah.

1017
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,040
 And I really, really liked it.

1018
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,000
 I think I do just want to say that I have just checked how I pronounce.

1019
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,720
 And the name of the, the civilisation is Tix Kalan, but given its made up word,

1020
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,920
 don't think about as much.

1021
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,560
 Thanks, Kalan. Well, it's between me based on a, on a real language.

1022
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:41,280
 But I mean, given how important like linguistics is to this book, I should

1023
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,920
 probably feel to at least pronounce the name of the empire.

1024
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,760
 So it is, it is a sequel to a memory called Empire, which won the Hugo.

1025
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,400
 Yeah, it's just got all the sort of stuff I like, which is it has, it has

1026
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:59,440
 politics, it has intrigue, it has characters who are trying to kind of forge

1027
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,640
 their own relationship in the face of, you know, in the face of their

1028
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,360
 upbringings in the face of how they feel about people from these different

1029
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,600
 empires. It has first contact with an alien species.

1030
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:18,320
 It has, you know, the use of language and poetry for communication, hidden

1031
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,440
 information. It has a really good sex scene. It's got lots of good stuff.

1032
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,000
 Oh, that, that last bit was a spoiler there.

1033
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,200
 There's a sex scene in it, Alison.

1034
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,680
 I'm looking forward, I've been looking forward to the sex scene in this novel

1035
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,000
 ever since about 10, 10 pages into the first one.

1036
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,840
 So it was pretty good.

1037
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,480
 Loved the first book.

1038
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,600
 I have a joke about this episode and this is it, which is that I look at these

1039
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:47,000
 six novels and I think what we have here is five petaloes and a swan.

1040
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,480
 And the Martin is the swan.

1041
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,680
 This is a book that is just so much better than any of the other books that it's

1042
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,080
 hard to believe they're in the same book contest.

1043
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,640
 Because it does all of these things.

1044
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,560
 I mean, I haven't got to the end of the second one yet.

1045
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,560
 So, but I was kind of like, can the second one be as good?

1046
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,080
 And it was like, oh, no, it's actually engaging right there from page one with

1047
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,000
 the alien, which is the thing that the first book doesn't do.

1048
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,040
 And I was like, oh, yes, yes, it definitely can.

1049
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,600
 I'm loving it. I had to tear myself away to come and do the podcast this morning.

1050
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,960
 Thanks, Halosan.

1051
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,520
 So having so much fun with this book.

1052
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,040
 Oh, this is what this is what I read science fiction for.

1053
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,520
 Doesn't get better than this.

1054
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,840
 Yeah.

1055
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,520
 Love it to bits.

1056
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,520
 Don't really want to criticize it too hard because, you know, it might break if you

1057
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,800
 look, if you if you apply your critical chisels to it with too much intensity.

1058
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,160
 It's a fantastic book.

1059
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,720
 And I'm only halfway through.

1060
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:48,080
 So hopefully it doesn't, it doesn't fall apart in the last 200 pages.

1061
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,480
 Be a bit sad if that happened.

1062
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,000
 I don't think it does.

1063
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
 I do think the previous year in which the Martin novel was in it.

1064
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,480
 I also felt that year that the Martin was kind of head and shoulders above its

1065
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,720
 competition.

1066
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,960
 I really adore as a writer.

1067
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,520
 I think she is fantastic.

1068
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:14,200
 And yeah, I had heard some people say that the second book was not as good.

1069
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:19,000
 And firstly, I think I enjoy the second book as much partly because I really

1070
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,960
 like first contact stories and kind of conversation where people are trying to

1071
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,920
 say things to other people that don't really understand them.

1072
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,840
 And so that again plays very specifically to something I love.

1073
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,240
 But unlike the we're, which is in sixth place, this book matches that cool idea

1074
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,440
 with some stonking blonde characters.

1075
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,760
 And I very much like that too.

1076
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,720
 And I can see how someone might not like it quite as much as the first book.

1077
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:44,160
 But like the first book is sublime and this book is very excellent indeed.

1078
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:49,880
 And yeah, I'm kind of very happy to put it at the top of my ballot.

1079
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,680
 And I'm glad that I enjoyed it as much as the first novel.

1080
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,800
 Liz.

1081
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,200
 Yes, I would say that I can see why you wouldn't like it as much as the first

1082
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,720
 novel because the first the first novel has that wonderful.

1083
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,600
 I am experiencing this society and learning about this society and it's also great.

1084
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:14,000
 And it's hard for a second book in the same universe to live up to that.

1085
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,400
 But I do think I felt it started a little bit slowly.

1086
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,160
 And then in the last couple of hundred pages, I really got what it was going to be.

1087
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,760
 Like what was going to be the theme?

1088
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,680
 No, not.

1089
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,400
 I mean, it starts slowly in plot terms, but I think it's really the end of it.

1090
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,880
 That all the things, the kind of, you know, paths that have been laid through the

1091
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,920
 first two thirds start to come together and you start to see why a character has to be,

1092
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:44,040
 you know, moved from A to B in the first two thirds in order for it to

1093
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,280
 satisfactorily kind of end up at sea at the end.

1094
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,480
 Like it all all starts to come together very nicely in a way, in a way that you want.

1095
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,640
 And therefore in like hindsight, the first section does not seem slow at all.

1096
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,720
 And I also thought, yeah, as a second book in a series, it manages to add the

1097
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:06,800
 extra thing and that the extra thing in this case is kind of even more thinking

1098
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,760
 about societies where individuals are not necessarily solely individuals,

1099
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,200
 but are linked or, you know, have access to the thoughts and feelings of other,

1100
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:23,400
 other individuals and what that brings to you as a society and how you have kind

1101
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,040
 of three very different societies that approach this in a different way.

1102
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:33,280
 And how they kind of all end up, I think, you know, working out about this in

1103
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,480
 different ways. It's not very coherent. But obviously, I'm pointing out why I

1104
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,600
 mean, like there's basically three very different approaches to not being an

1105
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,200
 individual who is the sole individual in your own, own mind.

1106
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,560
 And I think you see at the end that these three are going to come together.

1107
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:51,360
 And how, especially with, I won't, I won't spoil this to a trial and photo,

1108
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:58,480
 especially with 20 Cicada and his eventual decisions and outcome.

1109
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,880
 I really enjoyed. Oh, I love him as a character already.

1110
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,120
 Love, love, love, very excited by where that's going.

1111
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:09,760
 And also, I know that John talks about, about reading novels,

1112
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,720
 whilst not thinking too hard about what the author might be doing with particular

1113
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,800
 characters and where they might be taking them. But I, that the bigger

1114
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,800
 arm bells have gone off with that character. And I'm very excited about where that

1115
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:27,640
 goes. So, and, and again, I just assume that Martine is good enough that nothing

1116
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,920
 is in her novel, not for a reason, and it will all come out.

1117
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,840
 But I turned out to be wrong about that about the cats.

1118
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,160
 Apparently, sometimes a cat is just a cat.

1119
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,920
 No, a cat is always excellently a cat.

1120
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:44,360
 I did. I wanted to say, I wanted to say, actually, I was slightly wrong the year

1121
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,720
 that the previous Martine won. I also thought the 10,000 doors of January was

1122
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,720
 very, very good, very different. But I really enjoyed that.

1123
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,880
 But in fact, the second place novel and the most first place votes was for

1124
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,960
 Sean and McGuire's middle game.

1125
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:04,880
 Middle game is good, but I got slightly, I had good ideas by

1126
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,960
 don't didn't think it stuck the ending.

1127
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,680
 Well, I cannot tell you whether the Martine sticks the ending.

1128
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:19,360
 And now we're going to discuss some of the themes we think are arising from

1129
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:25,320
 these novels as a whole. I did want to say like, it is interesting to me that

1130
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:33,040
 two of these books, at least, are clearly highly influenced by lockdown,

1131
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:38,120
 because like the galaxy in the ground within and Project Hail Mary both feel

1132
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:43,280
 very much like books that were written by someone who was inside and could not

1133
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,600
 leave. And they are books about being inside and being unable to leave.

1134
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,080
 And that interested me.

1135
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,920
 And I thought I thought it was cool kind of, yeah, just thought it was cute and

1136
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,600
 kind of, I think, expected that that might be a theme of some of the novels

1137
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,760
 getting nominated for things at the moment. But yeah, I found that kind of

1138
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,040
 curious, I guess.

1139
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,960
 I think that's true for the chambers for the weir. I rather less

1140
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,400
 charated me just think he's not very good at writing two characters together

1141
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,200
 unless those two characters happen to be the same character in two bodies.

1142
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,400
 I don't want to spoil the ending, but in the ending, I got a very strong

1143
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,800
 sense of Dr. Zargle's book of Earthlets, which is a science fiction novel for two

1144
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:28,080
 year olds. And in the bit where they were putting the team together for the

1145
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:33,160
 spaceship, I got a very strong sense of Hugh Walter's novels in which there's a

1146
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,360
 kind of global space force that picks stereotypical people from each

1147
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:44,200
 character, as a country, and I feel like the Russian in that was better drawn

1148
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,600
 than the Russian in the weir. So, you know, so that was also aimed at eight year

1149
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:53,360
 old. So, so yeah, a little bit of aliens in alien suits in human suits or

1150
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,440
 humans in alien suits.

1151
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:59,640
 Because that was a cross cutting theme of this, the aliens in the Becky chambers

1152
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:05,480
 are not quite as alien as I'd like them to be. Give weir some credit, he does

1153
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:12,600
 some hard thinking about what sort of world generates life that's like Rocky.

1154
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:17,280
 And I feel like we could have chambers could do with doing a little bit more of

1155
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,600
 that in her world building rather than just assuming that you get, I mean, it

1156
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,080
 felt like the cantina, right?

1157
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:27,400
 I would argue that there is an extent to which all human writing about aliens

1158
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:34,000
 is humans in alien suits because we are limited by our own capacity to imagine

1159
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,200
 as deeply on health or comment. But I've, I think chambers is, I think, very

1160
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,400
 deliberately trying to imagine like, well, let's not constrain ourselves to what

1161
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,000
 we can imagine developing, but let's just say why have completely bizarre

1162
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,120
 creatures evolved like, and I kind of think that's almost kind of a nice way of

1163
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,440
 trying to get around the problem because then you're not limited by your

1164
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:59,720
 imagination of how life could evolve. You're just like, colours maybe. And I did,

1165
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:05,440
 I kind of respect that, but I do take your point. And like the Martin does a very

1166
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,080
 good job. Well, yeah, I think the Martin does a very good job with alien feeling

1167
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,840
 aliens. So, you know,

1168
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:16,480
 Well, I mean, I think the Martin does a very good job with different, different

1169
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,840
 human societies as well, right? So with all her barbarians.

1170
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,440
 I mean, that's the thing in, in some ways, it feels that the different human

1171
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:29,520
 societies in Martin's book have kind of more kind of communications, difficulties

1172
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,360
 and barriers between them than the completely alien aliens in Becky

1173
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,480
 Chambers books do. There's a lot of kind of points of common

1174
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,200
 allows you from childhood that childhood kind of does some of the same sorts of

1175
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,760
 things in all these different societies. And, and I think, Martin doesn't fall

1176
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,960
 into that trap. You know, her, her different human societies are very alien

1177
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,520
 in the way that actual different human societies can be.

1178
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,720
 Yeah, I was thinking the difference between like the the takes

1179
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:03,320
 clan and the cell station people who are not on a first first contact trajectory.

1180
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:07,560
 But it's also easy to do that with only kind of two, you know, really two

1181
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,240
 societies to play with. And in a reservation about the Aoki, her

1182
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,760
 aliens are really not very alien even by the standards of these things.

1183
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,360
 And they are literally wearing human suits. So, you know,

1184
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:22,680
 important, you know, that's not one of the things that her demon is not very

1185
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,120
 demonic and her aliens are not very like that sort of things.

1186
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:31,240
 I thought the demon was quite demonic, but maybe, I don't know, there might be

1187
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:35,720
 he does demonic, but also familiar in the way that like, you know, all demon

1188
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:40,120
 figures in literature kind of like Dr Faust. Yeah. Yeah.

1189
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,440
 I sort of feel like I sort of feel like part of this is like the same reason that

1190
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:47,880
 you never get properly compelling descriptions of hell. Because you can't

1191
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,320
 imagine like an eternity of suffering because you're only human.

1192
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,680
 But if there is a God and he has created an eternity of suffering, I believe it

1193
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,880
 will be an eternity of suffering. And I just can't imagine it.

1194
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,840
 Yeah. But that's also why having people getting

1195
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,880
 eternity of suffering needs to be given a little bit more weight in the novel

1196
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:10,200
 than it necessarily is in in life from a cover stars.

1197
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,160
 Well, I mean, let's be honest here.

1198
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,800
 There's no such thing as hell or aliens.

1199
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,680
 So there's no point in being too realistic about these things.

1200
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,640
 It's the sort of the same way that, you know, you can't you never dwell too

1201
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,400
 much in hell in the good place because like the thought is unimaginable.

1202
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,720
 You did go on about the sort of book that physicists.

1203
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,280
 So so the martin is the sort of book that civil servants like because the

1204
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:37,080
 politics of the diplomacy in those novels is just it's fantastic.

1205
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:41,440
 And despite the fact that Parker Chan has worked as a diplomat,

1206
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,400
 the diplomacy in that book didn't ring true for me.

1207
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:51,520
 And that is because I think I said earlier that human conversations don't often

1208
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,720
 don't go in the way that either character expects.

1209
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,120
 And martin does that a lot.

1210
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,240
 And Parker Chan does that not at all.

1211
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:04,440
 So every conversation that anybody has and it comes out the way that one of the

1212
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,960
 people was expecting to.

1213
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,920
 And that's not how diplomacy and politics work.

1214
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,920
 You said, oh, the sort of book physicists like and then proceeded to not at all

1215
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,960
 talk about that, but going on about diplomacy.

1216
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,240
 But I do want to bring up because I think you have a point, which is we talked

1217
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,240
 about cozy escapism when we talked about the chambers.

1218
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,200
 But from a different point of view, the we're is absolutely also cozy escapism.

1219
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,880
 Yeah, no 100%.

1220
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,640
 And so it's weird to think like those two things are definitely both cozy

1221
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,720
 escapism, even though I think if you told like, you know, fans of fans of Andy

1222
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,200
 were you are reading something which is cozy escapism in the same way.

1223
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,600
 I might read a romance novel or you might read the Becky Chambers.

1224
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,880
 They would absolutely not think that.

1225
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,240
 Alison just said that even though Parker Chan worked as a diplomat, like she had

1226
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,240
 problems with the Parker Chan book, because it didn't ring true to her in terms of

1227
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,520
 diplomacy. And I said, part of the reason the we're is the sort of book physicists

1228
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,240
 like is because it does a lot of linear extrapolation in ways that don't break

1229
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:05,720
 science. And you read as a physicist and awful lot of books that just do banana

1230
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,520
 things with physics.

1231
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,560
 I've never really minded that.

1232
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,120
 But I do have a lot of friends who I think mind it a lot more than me.

1233
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,560
 And the we're I think one of the reasons why I've got a lot of friends who really

1234
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,960
 like the we're is because I think that we're doesn't do that for the physicists

1235
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,840
 who mind it. But equally, there are very few things in SF where I have a

1236
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:29,440
 professional problem with because I'm quite happy to suspend my disbelief about

1237
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,120
 stuff that isn't physically rigorous.

1238
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:36,480
 And I think SF expects us to do that more with physics and maybe with biology

1239
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,880
 that it does with other stuff. But I don't know whether that's actually true,

1240
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,200
 or whether that's just like a bias I have from understanding one of those

1241
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:42,880
 things and not the other.

1242
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,840
 So the point you actually made when we were having this discussion, not on the

1243
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:51,360
 podcast was I got over this thing with physics a long time ago.

1244
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,480
 So maybe Alice, and it's time for you to get over it in terms of politics of the

1245
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,760
 stuff you remember from your civil service career and kind of sorts of

1246
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,240
 organizational structures, because I am very interested in the way that

1247
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,680
 organizational structures work and humans interacting with them.

1248
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,560
 And I like science fiction that does that and I like it to get it a bit right.

1249
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,240
 So yeah, maybe I do need to get over myself.

1250
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,800
 But I got over the physics thing as well, because I mean, I do know that

1251
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,840
 science, lots of science fiction doesn't take its starts too seriously,

1252
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,680
 which I think is to its benefit.

1253
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,320
 Liz, do you have any comments on how great science fiction is apology?

1254
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,360
 Nope. It's nearly in a time.

1255
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,000
 So no.

1256
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,240
 And then do you want to talk about lesbians?

1257
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,840
 I mean, I just put that because I realised there's an awful lot of

1258
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,000
 lesbians in these books.

1259
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,920
 The prime relationship of the Martin, the Clark, you know, the Parker

1260
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,000
 Chan, they are all basically centred around lesbian partnerships, which I

1261
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,840
 thought was interesting.

1262
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,760
 And even the chambers, which like has a nominally, well, it has a

1263
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,360
 heterosexual relationship, a human male and a female who is of a different

1264
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,200
 species who can change gender if she wants to.

1265
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,320
 And like, I would argue that just the species aspect makes it queer, but

1266
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,760
 it's also not quite as even if you ignore that aspect, it's not quite as

1267
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,680
 simple as being like, that is a straight relationship.

1268
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,720
 So it's an interesting point that a lot of these do explore that as a kind of

1269
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,080
 thing.

1270
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,120
 Yeah, I was thinking that it's interesting to me, it's not even just

1271
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:16,920
 queer relationships.

1272
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:21,000
 It is specifically in those four, like lesbian relationships, and indeed,

1273
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,320
 you know, and kind of older lesbians in the Ioki way.

1274
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:28,360
 I think I wasn't expecting to come up with such a disparate group of books, I

1275
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,120
 think. It's quite interesting to see.

1276
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,640
 I mean, there is a lot of it.

1277
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:39,120
 And there aren't any positive depictions of human heterosexual

1278
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,560
 relationships in these books, don't think?

1279
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,200
 I mean, the Project Hail Mary has no depictions of good relationships,

1280
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:45,760
 whatever.

1281
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,400
 I mean, I guess we've had plenty of years of that.

1282
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,960
 Yeah, that's it.

1283
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:54,480
 But we haven't really, because what we actually had was relationships between

1284
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,280
 science, dudes, and some effects.

1285
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,400
 So that doesn't count.

1286
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:57,880
 Yeah.

1287
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,000
 Yeah, I still think like the heterosexuals can, you know, take a back seat for a year.

1288
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:02,560
 Fine.

1289
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,360
 I don't mind.

1290
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,320
 Didn't mind it, but I would agree that there are a lot of lesbians in these

1291
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:06,560
 books.

1292
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,680
 If that's what you like, then the Hugo reading is for you.

1293
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,760
 I had another cross-cutting scene that I didn't put in that I'm going to say very

1294
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,520
 quickly, which is that I have never read all of the books on the Hugo ballot before.

1295
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:22,040
 This is like, this is like one of David Lodge's humiliation around, says it is I

1296
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,080
 haven't ever read all the books on the Hugo ballot before in time to vote.

1297
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:30,120
 And it's very interesting reading books, which are some of which it was that you

1298
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,320
 would never naturally pick up to read and then getting to sort of think, well,

1299
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,080
 how does the field all fit together at the moment?

1300
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,720
 Because some of these books are books that I would not normally have chosen.

1301
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:44,960
 That's why I like, I really like reading the Hugo shortlist because it forces me to

1302
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,840
 expand beyond like my kind of default.

1303
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,360
 And sometimes I am really pleasantly surprised.

1304
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:57,560
 And sometimes I'm not, but the amount I've gained from doing it has been far more

1305
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,160
 than the amount of time I've wasted on stuff I didn't really like.

1306
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:04,480
 I think I think in general, the balance is very much towards it being a positive

1307
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,880
 thing rather than a negative thing in my case.

1308
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,040
 So yeah, I like it.

1309
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,400
 I try into it.

1310
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:24,320
 If you work out from our votes, what our consensus kind of ballot would be, a

1311
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,520
 desolation called Peace is in first place, followed by Light from Uncommon Stars,

1312
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,040
 followed by She Who Became the Sun, followed by the Galaxy and the Ground Within,

1313
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,800
 followed by a Master of Gin, followed by Project Hail Mary.

1314
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,400
 So we all agree on our first and last place picks, and there's a little bit

1315
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,600
 jiggling around in the middle.

1316
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:46,600
 I think consensus wise, we all think the Parker Chan, as a consensus, we think

1317
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,200
 the Parker Chan and Ioki are better than the chambers and the clerk.

1318
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,120
 I know that Liz likes the clerk better than me and Alison.

1319
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,240
 Sorry, Liz.

1320
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:57,120
 I just want to say that consensus list is the same as my list.

1321
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,480
 So we should just have had a dictatorial thing where I told you what to believe.

1322
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,120
 And that would have done.

1323
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:06,760
 It seems unlikely.

1324
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,600
 Yeah, given how much I disagree with the consensus list, I will not be listening to

1325
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,520
 solely Alison's opinions on books.

1326
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,560
 What do we think will actually be the order of the books?

1327
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,880
 On the short list.

1328
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,320
 I think it might be quite close to our consensus list.

1329
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,960
 I wonder whether the chambers will do slightly better than we have ranked it.

1330
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,440
 I think the we're is going to do much better than we ever act it.

1331
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:34,120
 I think it's going to get a lot of first place votes from people who are very

1332
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,200
 sad about what sorts of books have been willing to go recently.

1333
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:41,160
 I think it might get a lot of first place votes, but I think it will

1334
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:45,400
 it will last first place votes and it will still not come second because the

1335
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,560
 overwhelming consensus of the community is not that even though there is a strong

1336
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,640
 minority for whom it is that by my wrong.

1337
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,360
 I think Martin will win.

1338
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,680
 Does anyone disagree with me on that?

1339
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,440
 No, I don't think any of the other books can take it.

1340
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:02,320
 I mean, I think it since it's already, you know, the previous one won, I think

1341
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,760
 in a very similar situation where there was other good stuff on the short list,

1342
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,360
 but it was probably just above them.

1343
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,640
 And I think the same thing will happen again.

1344
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,640
 Yeah, I think the we will get a lot of first place votes.

1345
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,440
 But then when it gets knocked out, it'll be interesting to see if any of them

1346
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,200
 actually redistribute to other stuff on the short list or if they kind of all

1347
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:22,280
 go into the no award bucket or just no air bucket because it feels like it

1348
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,720
 appears to appeal to quite different set of people.

1349
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,560
 What do we think should have been on the ballot that wasn't?

1350
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,280
 Like if you could take, if we take Project Hail Mary off the ballot,

1351
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,520
 what sixth book should have been on that ballot?

1352
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,160
 No offense to anyone who loved Project Hail Mary, but it is our sixth place choice.

1353
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,200
 So I would assume that is the one we would replace with a different one if we

1354
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,160
 were there, if we were the monarchs of the Hugo Awards.

1355
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,520
 I mean, I would put Aidan Tricowski's Shards of Earth on there because it is,

1356
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,000
 you know, having looked at books which we say, oh, the aliens are all a bit too human

1357
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,720
 humans in alien suits.

1358
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,880
 That is a book which really feels like it has some quite alien aliens,

1359
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,280
 included one who was sort of a distributed, a distributed intelligence.

1360
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:09,320
 And it's got all that couple to an actual plot, some good space opera,

1361
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,080
 a crew being rounded up to a century, a kind of semi-heist,

1362
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:19,400
 heist plotline, kind of universe destroying threat.

1363
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:24,880
 It's just got loads of stuff in there as well as having a lot of these aliens and also,

1364
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,760
 you know, some humans who are clearly dealing with some trauma from last time

1365
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,000
 that aliens came to attack.

1366
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,040
 So I think it kind of covers a lot of stuff which is in some of the Hugo finalists,

1367
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,280
 but does it all in one package and does it really well?

1368
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,880
 So I put that on.

1369
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:45,080
 Alison, I will put on Monica Burns, the actual star because I like

1370
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,600
 massively ambitious books, even if they're a bit flawed.

1371
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,520
 And I thought it was massively ambitious, more ambitious than anything else.

1372
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:56,160
 I read apart from possibly the routine because it ties these

1373
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:01,800
 seams of historical fantasy with modern day contemporary SF with far future SF.

1374
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,200
 And it brings it all together in a kind of twine story.

1375
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,600
 And it's just like catlit for Alison's.

1376
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:12,320
 And it's not perfect, but I would love to see more books like that on the Hugo ballot, please.

1377
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:18,640
 I have a dirty secret listeners, which is I haven't read that many books.

1378
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,080
 It's really 21.

1379
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:24,320
 So I'm just going through my good reads to find out which books were from 2021

1380
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,320
 so I can have an informed opinion and I shall read them out.

1381
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:35,160
 Now I read from 2021, The Psychopath Club by Sandra Bond,

1382
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,480
 The Rising Storm Star Wars, The High Republic by Kevin Scott, The Unraveling by Benjamin Rosenbaum,

1383
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,360
 The Jasmine Throne by Tasha Sierry,

1384
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:49,080
 Leviathan Falls by James S.A. Corey, and Star Wars, The High Republic Into The Dark by Claudia Gray.

1385
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:55,680
 Of those books, I'd probably go for The Psychopath Club, but The Jasmine Throne is a close second.

1386
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,200
 But yeah, of those, I think The Psychopath Club is the best one.

1387
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:04,400
 I have already plugged this book, but if you haven't read it, go and get it because it is great,

1388
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,600
 especially if you like The Wasp Factory by Ian Banks.

1389
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,640
 It has a lot of kind of, it really reminded me of that in a good way.

1390
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:15,680
 I wouldn't have nominated either of Star Wars is, and I didn't nominate Leviathan Falls.

1391
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:20,920
 The Expanse always were already won in series, so I don't think it needs any recognition.

1392
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,360
 Singly, I think they work better as a series anyway.

1393
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,800
 Did you not read, did you read Redemptor?

1394
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,160
 Oh, sorry, I should know.

1395
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:32,200
 I'm not mentioning ones that are on the load star ballot.

1396
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,400
 Ooh, OK.

1397
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,160
 I'm not sure whether I would have nominated any of them for Best Novel, but I did.

1398
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:43,320
 The ones I have read are very good, but like, I quite like how different the load star and novel

1399
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:47,680
 ballots end up being every year because it gives me a better view of the genre.

1400
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,320
 Goodness, that sounded one key.

1401
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,640
 I have a question.

1402
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,920
 Load Stars not a Hugo.

1403
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,080
 Do they still redistribute votes?

1404
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:59,920
 Oh, no, because like, if you nominate a novella in Best Novel, the votes would get nominated,

1405
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,800
 like, would get shunted back into novella by the administrators.

1406
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,040
 I assume they don't do that for load star.

1407
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:10,720
 No, you can explicitly know you can explicitly be nominated for both the

1408
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:13,000
 load star and Best Novel or Best Novella.

1409
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,440
 It does slightly surprise me, then, that there hasn't been a little bit more

1410
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:20,240
 crossover between the two, but maybe this is why load star was good.

1411
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:25,400
 But this is why it took forever to get a young adult category into the Hugo's.

1412
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,040
 Yeah, I think everyone was very worried about things just being in both because people

1413
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:34,040
 were very worried about the exclusivity of it, particularly as as we see, there's so

1414
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:38,560
 much stuff that feels quite young adult-like on the getting onto the novel ballot.

1415
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,800
 We might talk about the load star, not when he's later, sorry, the load

1416
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,960
 star finalists later in the year, we might not.

1417
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,600
 Well, apparently we're quite, we could talk, we could bleep on for some time about

1418
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,320
 science fiction.

1419
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:49,880
 Who knew?

1420
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,520
 It's interesting.

1421
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,280
 Listeners, we have been recording for four hours.

1422
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,800
 Now, admittedly, we did record a different episode earlier today.

1423
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:05,200
 So that's not all Hugo's, but I joined this Zoom call four hours and 53 seconds ago,

1424
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,280
 as I speak now.

1425
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,440
 That is a long session by Octa-Thop standards.

1426
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:14,240
 But that was the Octa-Thop podcast and it's goodbye from me.

1427
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,720
 It's goodbye from me.

1428
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,360
 And it's goodbye from me.

1429
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:37,360
 [Music]

1430
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:43,960
 I mean, I'm also this book, so far I'm at the point where this book has flat cats in

1431
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:48,360
 it and I'm like, Oh, Martin is too clever a science fiction writer.

1432
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:52,560
 So this is both flat cats in that it's a call out to flat cat and true to the flat

1433
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,360
 cats, I use the triples, right?

1434
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:57,800
 We have a cute species that is taking over the ship.

1435
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,160
 But clearly that's going to be linked to the overall theme as well.

1436
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:08,480
 There's no way those cats are turning up later as either the novel form of something

1437
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:12,120
 or an element of something or something that's going to be integrated into a

1438
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,120
 live mind or something of that kind.

1439
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:18,560
 You're making the classic mistake of not understanding people who like cats.

1440
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,560
 Sometimes a cat is just a cat.

1441
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,800
 Sometimes a cat is just a cat.

1442
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,960
 Oh, for fuck's sake, it's a bet.

1443
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,040
 It's a bet not be just a cat because fuck.

1444
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,720
 She's Mr. Trick there.

1445
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,800
 No, she hasn't.

1446
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,800
 It's a cat that illuminates something about the personality of people on the ship.

1447
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,920
 Yeah, they've been infected by a parasite that causes them to like cats.

1448
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,720
 No, that's a cat.

1449
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:46,800
 You're your your desire for mentions of cats to be not about cats is shining through here.

1450
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,000
 But as someone who likes cats, I very much enjoyed the cats.

1451
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,400
 It had been infected by a parasite.

1452
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,320
 And we are two thirds of us.

1453
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,080
 So so Liz has previously volunteered at a cat cafe.

1454
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:04,320
 So Liz is also full on board the cat train.

1455
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,840
 I did yesterday.

1456
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,920
 It was very nice.

1457
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,720
 Oh, Jesus.

1458
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,680
 If we were the Supreme Court, we'd be ruling two to one in favor of cats.

1459
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:20,080
 In favor of just having cute cats turn up in your lawn for no good reason on a spaceship.

1460
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,000
 No, a good reason.

1461
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,880
 Rather than what would actually happen on any actual spaceship,

1462
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,560
 which is that they'd have had a massive eradication program.

1463
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:33,600
 I think there is good precedent for laying cats on naval ships, right?

1464
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,320
 Yes, because they because they might because they do actually have massive.

1465
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:43,680
 The cats on naval ships are an eradication process program for the mice and rats on naval ships

1466
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,800
 and no kidding because they will ship store food.

1467
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,800
 Yeah, I know. I know. I know this.

1468
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,200
 But I think if you get to a point where your ships are sufficiently well,

1469
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:57,480
 like parrots, I think I think probably people on ships.

1470
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,000
 Ship.

1471
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,440
 We are having the podcast guys.

1472
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,320
 We're having a podcast.

1473
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,800
 No, because a big guy going back cats is not what we want.

1474
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:07,640
 There's a reason you can have the cats are there to also eliminate something about how people

1475
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:11,960
 change, how people interact with cats.

1476
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,360
 And it's also very much about like, you know, how do you continue being a person

1477
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,240
 when you are in space on a warship?

1478
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:21,680
 And maybe one of those things is seeing someone unexpectedly petting a cat.

1479
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:27,080
 Anyway, I don't have a problem with another alien life form turning up in this book.

1480
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,720
 And I'm totally up for that.

1481
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,680
 And clearly there are things I don't know yet because I'm halfway through.

1482
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,920
 But they're not the cats.

1483
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:37,680
