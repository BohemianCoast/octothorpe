00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,600
 Lizbati, Lizbati, does whatever a lippity can. Can she look at the stats? Yes she can, but she has no cats. Look out. Here comes the Lizbati.

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,480
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 100th episode of Octa Thought which is coming to you on the 4th of

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:44,320
 January 2024. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Lizbati. It's been 100 episodes. 100.

4
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,880
 That's quite a loss isn't it? That's a lot. When did we get to 100? I don't know. How did that

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,040
 happen? Yeah number go up. And so we're carrying on. We're not stopping doing more in 2024 because

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,760
 2024 is going to be a super quiet year for British science fiction fandom in which nothing important

7
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:10,640
 is going on. I mean if you end up murdered in your bed with a horse head made of Glasgow tartan

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,720
 on your pillow I will not be surprised. I nearly, it was midnight and I thought oh I could text Esther

9
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:28,000
 and say "hoping you have a peaceful and uneventful 2024". And it's time for letters of, hang on a minute,

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,960
 there's someone at the door. Oh it was the postman and he had a telegram. Oh now so non-

11
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,920
 non-British listeners may not be aware but on your 100th birthday you get a telegram from the monarch

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,480
 and we have a telegram here. Below two pieces of weetabix it reads

13
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,280
 "I am so pleased to know you are celebrating your 100th episode in January 2024.

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,440
 I send my congratulations on best wishes to you on such a special occasion."

15
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,960
 Claire Briarley of Croydon.

16
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,480
 I may have solicited this particular lock.

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,480
 John is screen-chairing it and yeah very good telegram.

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,640
 Thank you very much to Claire for sending us our birthday telegram.

19
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,320
 I thought it was apt given as Claire is obviously the reigning monarch of British fandom.

20
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,760
 Absolutely and then I'd like Mark's the Prince chord sort right?

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,960
 Yeah I think that's apt. I think that makes sense.

22
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,680
 Yeah they better have thrones for the McGlasko that's all I can say.

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
 *laughs*

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
 Thank you very much to Claire for our birthday telegram.

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,320
 We will see you at East Con and Glasgow variously.

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,560
 I'll see you on Thursday.

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,680
 Yes, that's fair.

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,360
 Christopher J Garcia emailed to say "barreling towards 100.

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
 What sort of special will you all be unleashing this, this?"

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,320
 It's the hangover special.

31
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,160
 Yeah we are recording on New Year's Day.

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
 In the morning.

33
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,160
 With very few show notes.

34
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,000
 Yeah but alcohol.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
 It's afternoon for Liz.

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,880
 Yeah I don't have show notes or alcohol.

37
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
 So anyone who is

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,200
 minded to complain that this is a slightly short slightly disorderly episode

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,480
 should look to last year where we put out a two minute episode for New Year.

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
 Did we?

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,040
 Yeah we do have so he says is this the first chapter of a trip report

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
 appearing on a podcast?

43
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,120
 Yes we believe so.

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,160
 If you know differently listeners write in but I think so.

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,720
 And he says Sandra is indeed a good egg.

46
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
 Thank you again Sandra for standing in for Liz who was on assignment.

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,120
 I must say something about my assignment.

48
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,600
 You can if you like but there's no obligation.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,360
 You pause for meaningful length of time.

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,600
 Are you an unassignment Liz?

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,560
 I will actually briefly say thank you to various bits of Bay Area fandom

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,040
 for showing me various bits of the Bay Area and also John who is not part of Bay Area fandom

53
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,120
 for showing me various bits of Bay Area.

54
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,760
 Well John are you like on a remember of Bay Area fandom did you marry into it or something?

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,400
 Does that count?

56
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,960
 Yee so sort of yes and no.

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,080
 Yeah.

58
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
 A Bay Area in law.

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,320
 Because I it's because I like actively work to take his fan you're away from Bay Area fandom.

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
 I'm not sure whether I count as a member or whether I'm like an agitator.

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,480
 Mmm are you their nemesis?

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,600
 I've been to a bass for meeting which for someone first in pub meetings in the UK was

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
 utterly bewildering.

64
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,880
 Oh all oh god everywhere they're all like this.

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,200
 Seattle and Toronto weren't?

66
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,960
 No but um Nesva is and I think Lasvas is and the Australian some of the Australian ones are.

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,080
 The critical what's it called critical thing?

68
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,520
 I should know this.

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,400
 Critical thing yep very enough.

70
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,640
 And Novamob and yeah the meetings it's really weird.

71
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,800
 I guess from that perspective like I guess the BSFA and the nine-plus alpha like are more

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,960
 meeting focused sometimes but like yeah it was weird to have like a uh uh city group

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,680
 be chaired uh odd but yes me and Liz went to a board game shop and then we went to

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,000
 a book shop and then we went to another book shop and then we had pizza and beer.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,720
 It was pretty good.

76
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,120
 And Brussels sprouts.

77
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,280
 Yes Brussels sprouts with daka and pomegranate molasses which were

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,920
 frigging great.

79
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,120
 JC was at the party I was at last night and um he was wearing a t-shirt with a picture of a

80
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,920
 Brussels sprout and the words not just for Christmas.

81
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,840
 I agree with that I do agree with that.

82
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,360
 Chris also says we have half of the Hugo stats numbers look like voters were voting in

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,200
 patterns that he thought they would although Journey Planet did better than he'd have thought.

84
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,000
 So yeah we know the voting for we know the voting but not the nominations.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Yeah so we know where we came in the stats.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,120
 Third.

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,240
 I think I was fourth or fifth and we were third we're third.

88
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,360
 It's pretty good.

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,600
 And Journey Planet was three votes off winning.

90
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
 Really?

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,400
 Oh.

92
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,000
 Which I was I was surprised by because like it often comes second which I think is the

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,520
 dichotomy between traditional fanzine like effect basically people who like PDFs and people who like

94
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,320
 websites.

95
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,160
 And I think basically the final two end up being all the people who like PDFs are very

96
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,480
 for Journey Planet and all the people who don't haven't.

97
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,880
 But yeah it was closer than I expected.

98
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,360
 But but actually the Chinese the Chinese fanzine that won is PDFs.

99
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
 It was it was quite a good year for traditional fans of.

100
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,880
 But also congratulations to Hugo Girl again for if you look at the stats

101
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,680
 knocking all the rest of us into a cockid hat.

102
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
 They got significantly more votes than anyone else.

103
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,760
 Excellent.

104
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,480
 Yeah they crushed us they crushed us all.

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,120
 Fear their domination.

106
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,000
 I'm kind of like Hugo Girl could crush me any time they like.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
 We should get badges because we have t-shirts.

108
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,920
 Crushed by Hugo Girl.

109
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,680
 We're not that sort of podcast.

110
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,080
 Come on.

111
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,240
 We were fourth, by the way, not third.

112
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,880
 Oh, I thought we were ten, oops.

113
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,880
 You were fourth, I thought we were fourth, I thought I was fourth as well.

114
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,800
 But maybe I was fifth, I don't know.

115
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
 I don't. You were fourth.

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,520
 I was fourth.

117
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,920
 You can tell I paid a lot of attention.

118
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,280
 As our official Hugo Statz mayven, Liz.

119
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,000
 Yes!

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,320
 What is the deadline for Dave McCarthy getting his figure out and getting the bornated zaps up?

121
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,680
 Oh, I meant to look this up and then I forgot.

122
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,960
 Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

123
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,000
 Liz bat.

124
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,680
 OK, so one of the things I did in the last week is read the six Warren Ellis written.

125
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,080
 Declan, Shavy, Drawn, episodes of Moon Knight issues.

126
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
 Hey!

127
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,720
 I can't distinguish the words issues and episodes in my mind anymore.

128
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,880
 They have become one word.

129
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,480
 Yup, ish, ish opponents.

130
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,480
 So, and they are, they are very stylish.

131
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,440
 Yes.

132
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,520
 And I kind of understand some stuff at the end of them, but I'm kind of like,

133
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,520
 "Should I go on and read the rest of the run written and drawn by other people or not?

134
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,280
 Or should I just go and watch the TV show?"

135
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,960
 The current Moon Knight run, I think, is better than the rest of the Ellis run

136
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,480
 and has extremely good art, but also has a really interesting,

137
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,720
 it's got some really interesting mystic concept.

138
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,720
 So if you wanted to carry on reading Moon Knight comics, I would read the currently

139
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,280
 running Moon Knight, which I really enjoy.

140
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,320
 I would say, what do they say about these things?

141
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,760
 I mean, the story is fine, but the art is fantastic.

142
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,120
 So that, and there is in particular, a bit of sequential art,

143
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,320
 which I think is fantastic that I have not seen used before in episode issue two,

144
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,160
 the sniper.

145
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,800
 Yes, yes, another one you mean.

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,600
 So I thought that was a magnificent and, yeah, not a pick,

147
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,240
 but that was one of the other things I did over Christmas in the year.

148
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,400
 So I might go, I might do some more Moon Knight.

149
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,960
 It is the reason Moon Knight's relevant people is that over in another place,

150
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,160
 doing the Moon Knight game book as a kind of collective thing.

151
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,280
 Choose your own adventure. Yeah.

152
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,480
 So I was like, how do I know nothing of this character?

153
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,080
 I still don't understand why the character totally passed me by,

154
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,680
 despite the fact that Bill Cinkovitz drew it in like 1980 or something.

155
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,200
 And I was quite the Cinkovitz fan for a while.

156
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,720
 I would say I think the current runner

157
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,760
 moonlight also has great art, which is one of the reasons why I'm really

158
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,440
 enjoying it, like some of the art reminds me of that Ellis run.

159
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,680
 Liz, you return.

160
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,480
 Yes.

161
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,240
 What did you find out?

162
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,480
 What did I find out?

163
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,880
 So the full Hugo stats must be released by January 19th.

164
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,600
 So we are at most kind of two weeks away from stats, full step.

165
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,080
 Whoo.

166
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,040
 Well, not quite.

167
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,400
 There is a chance they won't be out the next time we record.

168
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,280
 Yeah, I mean, there's a chance they won't come out on January 19th,

169
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,440
 because what happens if you don't do the stats on time, basically, nothing.

170
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
 But I think they probably will.

171
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,920
 Dave McCarthy, I'm going to sick moonnights on you.

172
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,640
 I mean, Jeff is phone number.

173
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,000
 You're just going to call him up.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,640
 That's just helping job with his editing issues.

175
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,120
 Yeah.

176
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,240
 Do you want some like stats?

177
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,600
 Fingers, though, from what we've got so far.

178
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,880
 Oh, yes, please.

179
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
 Yes, yes, yes.

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,600
 Yes.

181
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,080
 And I mean, I also say that Nicholas White did a blog post on this as well, which we will link to.

182
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,800
 Basically, there were quite a lot of sort of just first round winners, right?

183
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,840
 Like you don't have to redistribute them.

184
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,760
 They've just got a ton of votes.

185
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,240
 So they are over 50 percent of the votes in the first round.

186
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,360
 So, for instance, Nettle and Bone was a runaway winner for novel.

187
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,040
 You know, some of the others are quite close, but that was a runaway winner.

188
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,240
 Surprisingly, to me, children of time was a runaway winner.

189
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,440
 I thought that was going to be quite a contested category.

190
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,640
 Yes.

191
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,080
 Isn't that fantastic?

192
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,720
 Nobody was just like everyone was like, no, this is clearly brilliant.

193
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,320
 Give it a hugo, which is correct.

194
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,560
 Correct, I say.

195
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,680
 I mean, it's correct, but I did spend at least two years

196
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,720
 bigging up Robert Jackson Bennett's trilogy, which came last.

197
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,920
 So you can still read it.

198
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,000
 Still there. It's still good. Yeah.

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,640
 Yeah. No, that surprised me.

200
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,760
 Some of the ones that came last were almost more surprising, right?

201
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,240
 Because like, no, no came last in novels.

202
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,880
 So clearly a lot of people did find that book enormously frustrating and it was not

203
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,360
 just Alison. Yeah.

204
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,040
 So like the Terry Pratchett biography again, runaway winner, everything everywhere,

205
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,240
 all at once, unsurprisingly, pretty much a runaway winner.

206
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,120
 I'm not all of these were in the first round, but they were like well ahead of

207
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,480
 everyone else, Neil Clark, best editor, and J.

208
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,520
 Now, absolutely smashed it in a press professional artist, which I was not

209
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,640
 expecting. I mean, I thought their art was great, but I wasn't expecting them to get

210
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,800
 kind of over 370 out of 710 votes.

211
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
 So that was pretty impressive.

212
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,520
 Stranger Isons were in the lead for five rounds and lost on the very last

213
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,920
 redistribution of votes by 20 votes.

214
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,400
 So that was really close and it must be, I think it must be a bit

215
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,320
 going for the Stranger Isons team who have been second a lot and they're kind

216
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,040
 of almost there and never quite make it.

217
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,520
 Yeah. Best Fanzine was incredibly close.

218
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,000
 Best Fancast was not best fan writer, one vote in it.

219
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,640
 Hmm. Yeah.

220
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,160
 So if you didn't vote in Best Fan writer, you could have swung it.

221
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,520
 Well, you could have made a tie, which would have been very interesting.

222
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,040
 Who could you swung it for?

223
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,360
 Well, you could have saw it was Chris Barkley by one vote over Riverflow.

224
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,120
 So if you were playing for Riverflow and didn't.

225
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,280
 Yeah. Yeah, don't tell them.

226
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,360
 Yeah. So that's the Hugo voting stat.

227
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,960
 We're still in letters of comment.

228
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,400
 This has been a very oddly structured episode.

229
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,800
 That's OK. I mean, it's that time kind of between Christmas and New Year.

230
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,080
 Time has no meaning.

231
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,480
 Bitwixtmus.

232
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,680
 It's not between Christmas and New Year, Liz, because the New Year happened already.

233
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,520
 Kind of. Yeah, but it's still in that that

234
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,160
 Interregnum before anybody does any work spiritually.

235
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,120
 It's in the 12 days.

236
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,360
 Do you think we can do this entire episode without ever leaving the letters of comment

237
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,160
 segment? Maybe that could be episode 100.

238
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,360
 We've only got one more letter of comment.

239
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,960
 So, yeah, let's let's go go.

240
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,680
 Why not? We have a letter of comment from Erwin Hirsch.

241
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,600
 I have to explain that I was joking about thing, which is when I said it's

242
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,760
 quite a coincidence that both of the fan funds are sending delegates to the World

243
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,680
 Con. No, of course it isn't.

244
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,640
 I ran a fan fund for two years.

245
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,880
 I understand how fan funds work, people.

246
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,200
 And I thought it was weird that Alison and Sandra both treated me as if I was

247
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,560
 like being completely on the record.

248
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,200
 So I didn't say it out loud.

249
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,240
 It was a joke.

250
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,040
 I'm not saying it was a funny joke, but nevertheless, Erwin Hirsch has written

251
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,800
 to enumerate some stats on this happenstance.

252
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,640
 But we do love stats.

253
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
 Thank you, Erwin.

254
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
 Stats are great.

255
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,480
 Yeah.

256
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,600
 And what I actually need to do is work out whether the stats disprove the null

257
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,560
 hypothesis or whether it's actually impossible to reject the null hypothesis

258
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,120
 that this is a coincidence at the 5% level because it would be quite funny if

259
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,320
 actually the evidence doesn't prove the hypothesis.

260
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,520
 But unless Erwin has lost count since 1979, there have been eight World

261
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,720
 cons in Europe and at seven, Guff and Taff both had delegates.

262
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,320
 The only one that missed out was 1990, which was the Hague.

263
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,200
 Yeah, it was a conviction of the Hague.

264
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,880
 Yeah, which there was no Taff race.

265
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,400
 And actually, I am genuinely surprised that that is the case.

266
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,360
 I would have assumed they all had one of each.

267
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,240
 And if it hadn't been one, I would have assumed it was Guff.

268
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,160
 So yeah, I'm surprised that it was Taff letting the side down.

269
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,360
 Yeah, I think Taff might have been in slight.

270
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,440
 Oh, was that just after Abbey Frost?

271
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,920
 I don't know, but a slight disarray.

272
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,400
 Don't maybe to the Taff website.

273
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,920
 I'm already on it.

274
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:40,720
 No, it's pre Abbey Frost because I was I feel like I was quite an actor fan

275
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,800
 at the point where Abbey was running and and in 1989, I kind of wasn't, you know,

276
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,920
 I was inter-fandom, but I wasn't.

277
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,280
 I didn't, I wasn't really into Taff and stuff.

278
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,320
 Yeah, so I don't know why there wasn't one.

279
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,560
 I mean, maybe they just didn't have enough

280
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,040
 funds or maybe they just didn't have enough support at the time to manage to run

281
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,760
 two races in the same direction in consecutively.

282
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,280
 But basically they skipped 1990 in Thailand.

283
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,880
 Yeah.

284
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,280
 So also Erwin says in 1984, Rob Hanson was

285
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,240
 LA con two as the Taff delegate and just an

286
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,720
 aquoid went to LA con two for a lot his guff trip, which I do feel is a slight

287
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,840
 kind of stretching the boundaries of what guff is for.

288
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
 But there we go.

289
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,800
 I mean, it's yes, it's good looking back at the history, isn't it?

290
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,240
 It is.

291
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,600
 And I think we should thank Dave Langford for having a website that basically

292
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,680
 has every single race and like all the newsletters online.

293
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,280
 So I can actually dig into this.

294
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,120
 You're showing your showing guff up a bit on you, Dave.

295
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,880
 Because I've got a whole string of emails in my

296
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,520
 intray inbox that are basically shouldn't we do something about the Guff website,

297
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,200
 to which the answer is definitely oh, yes.

298
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,480
 Like should go have a website.

299
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,880
 Guff does have a website.

300
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,600
 It's Taff.org.uk/guff.html.

301
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,640
 Yeah.

302
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,720
 That which, you know,

303
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,600
 and there's also Oz fans dot A.U or something like that.

304
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,920
 Oz fans, Oz fans.com.

305
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,880
 I can segue here, I think.

306
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,360
 Speaking of world cons Glasgow in 2024,

307
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,120
 the world con that will be happening this year in Britain announced a special guest

308
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,240
 who is games related.

309
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,440
 Tell us about her.

310
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,840
 Yes, they announced Tanya de Pass, who is, I mean, I know her from,

311
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,600
 I think her blogging and Twitter and else was a founder of any diverse game.

312
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,080
 So a game, you know, a project to diversify gaming.

313
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,200
 And so she's done a lot of work on video games and on RPGs.

314
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,520
 And yeah, I'm not going to go through the whole biography, which is on the Glasgow

315
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,480
 website and we'll link to it.

316
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,680
 But she sounds like a great guest and I think she feels maybe a gap in the guest

317
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,680
 and a line up of someone who is deeply, deeply involved in games and has done a lot

318
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,080
 of interesting work in the field of games.

319
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,160
 And that will be really nice to kind of have have that filled by an expert special

320
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,080
 guest. So I'm quite excited about this way.

321
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,880
 No, it's good.

322
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
 Glasgow are going from strength to strength.

323
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,240
 No, she's a really good choice for guest.

324
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,640
 This is brilliant.

325
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,680
 Yeah.

326
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,120
 Yeah.

327
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,880
 Erwin also talks.

328
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,080
 He says the only conventions where Guff and Daff both sent delegates that were not

329
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:48,960
 World Cons were the 2008 and 2012 British Easter cons, although I think that's wrong

330
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,440
 because Sue Ann and Trevor Klark, Sue Ann Barber and Trevor Klark attended

331
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,920
 L.X. in Bradford and that was 2009.

332
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,760
 So I wonder whether it's just 2012.

333
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
 But did we have a tough delegate that year?

334
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,360
 Chris, we had the he says that Sue Ann Barber and Trevor Klark and Chris

335
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,560
 got here both went to 2008 and I know Chris was at 2008, but I remember Sue Ann

336
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,440
 and Trevor were at L.X.

337
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,920
 So I don't know whether that's true.

338
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,360
 I wonder whether the list of past Guff winners says that Sue Ann and Trevor went

339
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,400
 to 2008 because they did not know.

340
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,760
 No, the Guff website is correct and backs up my memory.

341
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,440
 And then the 2009 TAF trip would have been to the States.

342
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,960
 I can't remember who won it.

343
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,600
 2009 TAF.

344
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,320
 Yes.

345
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,880
 Who was oh Steve Green.

346
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,760
 Steve Green won it because he was administrator when I was running.

347
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,400
 So Erwin, I think it's just the 2012 Easter con because the 2008 Easter

348
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,600
 con did not have the Guff delegates and there wasn't a Guff race in 2008 at all.

349
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,680
 But the 2009 TAF race was the to the States.

350
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,640
 So there's there's no way Sue Ann and Trevor were a convention with a TAF

351
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,560
 and Chris wasn't a convention with a Guff.

352
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,480
 So I think that's incorrect.

353
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
 But thanks for writing in Erwin.

354
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,400
 On the subject of writing, have you guys read any books recently?

355
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,440
 Mate, I've read a lot of books.

356
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,200
 I feel like I feel like 20,000,000,000 was a much better book reading year for me

357
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,160
 than 22,000,000,000,000.

358
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,880
 But good read says I read fewer books.

359
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,800
 So I'm confused and I still did not hit my 52 books in a year read.

360
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,520
 But I have read the Coral Bones by E.J.

361
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,880
 Swift, which was one of the nominees, one of the finalists for the clock award.

362
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,120
 I thought it was pretty good.

363
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,040
 And this novels tells the story.

364
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,560
 It's three interlinked narrative.

365
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,080
 I mean, I'm a sucker for this, right?

366
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,040
 Three interlinked narratives by women past, present and future.

367
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,360
 And they are all connected to coral reefs.

368
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,320
 I understand that Swift had not visited Australia when she wrote the book,

369
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,520
 but she definitely had visited Australia by the time she wrote the

370
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,600
 acknowledgments in the book.

371
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,760
 So because she did actually get out and go snorkeling.

372
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,680
 So there is a little bit of a this is a holiday book about it.

373
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,120
 I didn't really interested to see whether actual Australians like this book or only

374
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,320
 or only people who have recently visited Australia, for whom a lot of the

375
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,840
 scenes and events in it were quite resonant.

376
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,320
 There's a kind of current story about climate change destroying the Great Barrier

377
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,720
 Reef. And there is a past story in which a woman who is the daughter of a

378
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,880
 explorer successfully managed to get out to go on one of her father's expeditions

379
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,440
 in a way that is not necessarily all that convincing.

380
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,600
 This is a that's I thought the least good section of the novel.

381
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,920
 And there is a future world where people are dealing with the consequences of climate

382
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,440
 change and yes, it's another climate novel, but I thought it was quite good.

383
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
 Really enjoyed it.

384
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,800
 I also really enjoyed Liz's pick for Shadowing.

385
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,400
 Well, I really enjoyed your pick, Alison, which I think I've mentioned at the time.

386
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,520
 So it's a good book.

387
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,320
 We should read a good 2022 book.

388
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,520
 Haven't started talking about good 2023 books yet.

389
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,920
 The Coral Bones is the Clark Award nominee that people thought was good that I

390
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,640
 haven't read yet. And I am it is on my list of things to read, but I am hoping I

391
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,560
 will very much like it. It sounds like my cup of tea.

392
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,640
 Also, it is beautifully produced by a small press called "Unsung Stories",

393
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,160
 which differs from other UK small presses in that it has extremely strong design

394
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,760
 views and they've packed it in because they can't make any money and it turned

395
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,520
 out that they were, you know, they were doing it a little bit of work for for the

396
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,880
 return and eventually it became too much for them, but they've published some good

397
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,760
 books in the meantime.

398
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,720
 This is one of the ways that small presses go.

399
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,760
 So that's a bit sad.

400
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,320
 But anyway, this is a good book and it would be nice to have small presses who

401
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,840
 are publishing very good books like this.

402
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,440
 So what I'm hearing is I need to hurry up and buy it before I can't.

403
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,560
 Oh, I know they've packed they've not gone bust.

404
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,280
 They've just stopped doing publishing new books.

405
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,880
 OK.

406
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,320
 I mean, I think you have to buy them as ebooks now.

407
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,040
 I keep their old books in print.

408
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,480
 Probably won't be able to get a paper book very easily, I don't think.

409
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,920
 No, you can only get a handful of paper books from them, but I think they're still

410
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,360
 up as ebooks on Lee Summer's doors.

411
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,880
 I'm just going to check that out, actually.

412
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,840
 Fair enough, fair enough.

413
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,160
 Yeah, you can still buy on Kindle.

414
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,800
 I don't think you can buy the ebooks.

415
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,720
 And I can buy ebooks through their website and there's a hand full of paperbacks left.

416
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,320
 So yeah, it is a shame.

417
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,360
 No, it's a great shame.

418
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,200
 And I think I think it will be more up your avenue, John, because I think you

419
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,680
 like venomous lump sucker, I think there is more to kind of either really like or

420
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,080
 dislike about it.

421
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,680
 It's a bit more marmighty.

422
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,000
 I think the coral bones is just kind of

423
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,200
 yeah, reliably good, but maybe the highs are not quite as high as venomous

424
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:51,000
 sucker if you like it. Yeah, I mean, I can see why both why the club judges gave

425
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,680
 the award to venomous lump sucker over this and also why people might think that

426
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,280
 was a terrible thing to have done.

427
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,120
 Liz, do you have read any books?

428
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
 It's a simple question.

429
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,920
 Do you have read any books?

430
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,880
 I do have read books.

431
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,360
 Wait, apparently in 2023, I somehow read 96 books.

432
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,400
 Wow.

433
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
 Hold on, hold on.

434
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,680
 I don't know when I I don't know when I did that on the beach.

435
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,840
 It was on the beach.

436
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,560
 I've only been to the beach a couple of times like this year.

437
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,120
 I need to go to the beach more Liz.

438
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,560
 Oh, you set us photos of the beach more than twice in 2023.

439
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,080
 I don't think I did.

440
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,560
 I think I may have sent you pictures of a couple of different beaches, maybe,

441
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,240
 but they're all in the same location.

442
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,200
 I had one beachy trip, so obviously I need to go to more beaches so I can read more

443
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,720
 than 96 books.

444
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,000
 But yeah, I think in a future episode, we can go through some 2023 books and things

445
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,040
 we would like to nominate, maybe for the Hugo's.

446
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,800
 But I will make a start by picking some desperate glory by a standing award winner

447
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,720
 Emily Tesh.

448
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,560
 I've got to confess I didn't really pay much attention to the novella that she

449
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,760
 won the astounding award for, but this is her first novel and it is really good.

450
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,480
 Nice.

451
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,640
 I'm going to say more John.

452
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,600
 I'm not finished yet.

453
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,840
 Oh.

454
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:26,000
 It is basically a space opera about Kia who is essentially a child soldier

455
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,320
 training to avenge the destruction of planet Earth.

456
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,920
 And so she's been raised by kind of the last bits of humanity on a space station

457
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,240
 in a very regimented environment ready for the time she will go out and kind of

458
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,080
 take revenge on the aliens who destroyed the Earth.

459
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,200
 And I mean, it doesn't take you long to realise what's going on, which she is

460
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:54,560
 basically being raised as this fascist soldier by these renegades humans.

461
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,120
 And the novel is about her figuring out that maybe, you know, everything she's

462
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,320
 been told is a lie, but it's not all a lie.

463
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,880
 So it's it sounds like a very kind of bog standard, maybe why a space opera.

464
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,360
 Oh, she's a child soldier, but fish figures out.

465
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,560
 So what's going on and has an epiphany and it all ends up going OK, but it kind of

466
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:22,440
 almost like speed runs enough block to put into about three novels and it's got

467
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,160
 alternate universes and kind of alternate versions of her and alternate ways.

468
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,200
 Things could have gone and it sort of sets up this little squad and you think,

469
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,000
 she's going to have this squad of disparate individuals who all come together to

470
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,400
 save things and no, not really.

471
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,760
 It's much more interesting than that.

472
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,800
 So I can say is like, if you read the blurb, you might think this sounds like a

473
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,480
 very not an interesting twist on a story that's been done before, but it is a really

474
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,360
 interesting twist on a story that has been done not quite like this before.

475
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,000
 So you should all go out and read it.

476
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,880
 Interesting.

477
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,000
 That sounds really good.

478
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,480
 I really liked it.

479
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:04,280
 And I thought it did a very good job of both making it very clear that she was

480
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,600
 she was well read in the genre of young adults books that that had done these

481
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,680
 sorts of that had dealt with these sorts of themes, but was obviously doing a fresh

482
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,920
 take on it, but also doing a book that would be perfectly accessible to somebody

483
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
 who had not read all of those books.

484
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,360
 And I thought that's quite clever.

485
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,000
 Yeah.

486
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,880
 I think it was absolutely perfect, but I think it's generally pretty good.

487
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,880
 There are lots of things I liked about it all through.

488
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,480
 And it's one of the books for 2023 that is getting quite a lot of buzz.

489
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,280
 So thank you.

490
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,480
 The library systems of the world.

491
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,280
 I was going to talk about libraries because I had a library crisis.

492
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,080
 I forgot to renew my library books when I was in Australia and unfortunately there

493
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
 were 10 of them.

494
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,880
 And by the time I found out I had incurred a fine of 65 pounds.

495
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,560
 And then when I returned to Britain and said, Oh, no fair dues.

496
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,480
 I will pay this fine.

497
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,040
 I discovered I was caught in a cat,

498
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,720
 a cat, a grass nightmare where I could only pay the fine by going physically to a

499
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,520
 library and paying on the machine.

500
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,200
 But the first time I went, the second machines were down and the second time I

501
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,880
 went, it wouldn't let me pay.

502
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
 It was like you're blocked.

503
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,760
 You're blocked user.

504
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,000
 You cannot pay a fine.

505
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,080
 And I was like, well, can I pay a fine another way?

506
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,440
 And I was like, well, you can only pay the fine on the machine and took five library

507
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,560
 visits and about 40 emails before this got sorted out.

508
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,600
 But the resolution was that they waved my fine.

509
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,640
 I'm reasonably happy and my library card works again.

510
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,160
 But it kind of told me not to do my former habit was to take out 10 endless

511
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,080
 live paper library books and keep them renewing them until the point where I

512
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,520
 finally got around to reading them.

513
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,760
 And this was probably this is probably a mistake.

514
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,560
 So I'm going to try and reduce my dependence on actual paper library books.

515
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,160
 And in honor of this, I have found a couple of libraries that you can join,

516
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,080
 despite not being a resident of the relevant place so that I can increase my

517
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
 library reach.

518
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,680
 And I don't want to kind of broadcast them.

519
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,000
 But thanks Emily January who told me how to do this tomorrow and tomorrow and

520
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,880
 tomorrow, which is a previous pick from Liz.

521
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,920
 I had a 498 day waiting list on Libby for London libraries consortium.

522
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,160
 And it has been delivered to my e-reader,

523
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,360
 the California library that I joined.

524
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,600
 So I'm quite pleased with that.

525
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,640
 So because that's a 2023 book.

526
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,200
 It's not.

527
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,760
 So because this problem with very long wait times from libraries is that you cannot

528
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,480
 read books in nomination season unless you buy them.

529
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,600
 But you know, I mean, I do appreciate your enthusiasm, but it was published in 2022.

530
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
 So what's it?

531
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,760
 A bollocks.

532
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,200
 That tickled me.

533
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:43,760
 OK, I am also going to discuss a book that I read that is from that is from 2022.

534
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,840
 And that is The Spear Cuts Through Water by Simon Jimenez.

535
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,920
 It really good.

536
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,080
 Two thumbs up.

537
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,160
 Didn't I pick it?

538
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,000
 Nope.

539
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,560
 Oh, I thought I did.

540
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,320
 Maybe not.

541
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,440
 As not as far as I can tell.

542
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,360
 Oh, maybe I didn't.

543
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,120
 I should have done.

544
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,640
 Yeah, you should have done because it's great.

545
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,440
 I have not yet read this book, but it is on my list.

546
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,000
 I liked his first book.

547
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,720
 I didn't like it quite as much as another book by a different sounding

548
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,640
 finalist that year, which was the one you really liked Liz.

549
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,280
 What was that called?

550
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,880
 About the dimension hopping space between worlds by Mackay and Johnson.

551
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,240
 Yeah, that's the badger.

552
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,560
 Yeah, I like that slightly better, but I thought him and his first book was good

553
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,720
 and like really interesting, like probably more interesting than the spaces

554
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,760
 between worlds, but like probably less well executed.

555
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:41,400
 This one is even more ambitious in many ways and is just amazing.

556
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,240
 I tore through it.

557
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,160
 A lot of people said the framing device was really confusing.

558
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,080
 And I found it fine, which makes me worried.

559
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,000
 I missed something, but like is I guess is on the confusing side, but like I've

560
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,600
 it, you know, I just went with it and eventually it turned out that things

561
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,080
 were happening and you found out what they were.

562
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,120
 But yeah, but I mean, as someone who primarily reads for vibes,

563
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,480
 the vibes are strong with this book and I very much enjoyed the vibes.

564
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,520
 It's about two people on a road trip.

565
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,840
 Plot summarised.

566
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,200
 Because Liz is laughing.

567
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,680
 I mean, technically correct, but pretty useless.

568
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,320
 My aim with all my plot summaries is episode 100.

569
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,960
 So I can now finally reveal this.

570
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,560
 My aim with all my plot summaries is to give technically correct, but utterly

571
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,960
 useless plot summaries of everything I encounter.

572
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,600
 Oh, are we, um, is that the first time we've ever all three three of us picked

573
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,320
 books because that is weird.

574
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,520
 I don't know if it's the first, I can't be the first, surely not.

575
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,680
 Hang on to the list.

576
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,560
 To the list.

577
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,680
 We have a list of picks now so that we don't repeat ourselves too much.

578
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,640
 Thank you, John.

579
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,480
 No, it isn't.

580
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,000
 We did it on episode 47 where I picked the psychopath club by Sandra Bond.

581
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,720
 Alison picked Sibilant Frickative by Adam Roberts and Liz picked The Witness

582
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,920
 for the Dead by Catherine Addison.

583
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,040
 Yeah, I've just finished The Grief of Stones, which is the sequel to The

584
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,960
 Dead, The Witness for the Dead.

585
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,200
 And then we did it again on episode 50 where I picked Leviathan Falls.

586
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,360
 You picked the actual star and Liz picked Elder Ace.

587
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,120
 It is definitely true that I am the least likely to pick a book, which makes

588
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,720
 me slightly, uh, feel slightly weird, but a lot of movies.

589
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,800
 Yeah, I have also got Leviathan wakes out of the library.

590
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,600
 So you see 2024 might be the year where I fully engage with the expanse and its

591
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,960
 books. I will say Leviathan wakes his following, but push through because

592
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,360
 episode books two and three are better.

593
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,440
 Certainly I'm.

594
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,200
 We returned to the expanse when we ran out of For All Mankind to Watch because

595
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,240
 we're now on the drip feed of one episode a week for For All Mankind, which is not

596
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,000
 enough. So the expanse kind of gives me a a a science fiction television vibe.

597
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,920
 This is quite good.

598
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,560
 Thank you, Erwin, for writing in.

599
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,800
 Did we get any other letters?

600
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,880
 We got some toots from Raj.

601
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,000
 So Raj wrote us two toots.

602
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,840
 Firstly, he put up the Liz bat signal.

603
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,240
 He wants to know, can he nominate the whole of ghost season five for best

604
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,200
 dramatic presentation long form?

605
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,360
 It's no longer than Oppenheimer.

606
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,920
 Yes, I should think so because it's television series.

607
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,960
 They often go into best presentation.

608
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,680
 I'm not Liz. I am obviously not an expert.

609
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,120
 Hang on, breaking news.

610
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,600
 I mean, I don't see why not.

611
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,960
 But yes, and I think ghosts was one of the things in people happy mentioning it in

612
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,800
 the giant Hugo spreadsheets of doom.

613
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,840
 Yes, I need to watch it.

614
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,040
 I haven't watched it yet.

615
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,800
 I've only watched one and a half seasons of it.

616
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,920
 So I think we probably just finished Lower Decks because we kind of have a comedy

617
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,560
 slot in our television rotation.

618
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,680
 Fair enough for enough.

619
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:10,680
 And then he also says that we need to make room for him on our soapbox because he

620
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:17,640
 also doesn't like it when there's a when novels have the subtitle a novel.

621
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,640
 So, yep, you are welcome to stand on this soapbox.

622
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,080
 Raj, anytime.

623
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,000
 Just to be clear, I believe that is John's soapbox.

624
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,120
 I mean, it's a large soapbox and I welcome all comers.

625
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,200
 I'd like, yeah, but I'm not sure I've owned the soapbox with you this time.

626
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,080
 I think that was your soapbox and my soapbox is the TikTok made me read it.

627
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,920
 Yes.

628
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,520
 Which today's prime example was the Virgin Suicides TikTok made me read it.

629
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,040
 Apparently I was in and I might well have told this story on the podcast already.

630
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,640
 I apologize.

631
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,640
 It was a long time ago, but when I was in, I was in Maryland over a part of March

632
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,680
 and I went to a shopping mall to do some shopping and I went into a bookshop and

633
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,760
 they had a shelf which was labeled TikTok made me read it.

634
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,000
 So it is not just the online booksellers that are employing this strategy.

635
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
 Oh, no, it's not.

636
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,960
 So I don't know if you guys saw the Goodreads choice awards where they have

637
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,560
 invented the category of romanticcy.

638
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,000
 Nice, which I think is explicitly designed to be books.

639
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,200
 I just want to read.

640
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,280
 Goodreads is I've been having trouble with Goodreads all through this podcast

641
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,280
 and this will not surprise you, the Goodreads servers are overloaded on the 1st of January.

642
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,880
 Isn't all fantasy basically romance because it's all about falling in love with a different world?

643
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,680
 No.

644
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,880
 This.

645
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,680
 Oh, OK, fair enough.

646
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,840
 Goodreads is currently recommending that I read the book called Dungeon Master's Guide,

647
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,680
 Dungeons and Dragons, 5th Edition.

648
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,920
 And there's no button to say on no account do I want to read that.

649
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,080
 Thanks, Goodreads.

650
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,680
 Do you know what Goodreads thinks I should read?

651
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,280
 No, tell me.

652
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,880
 It thinks I should read China,

653
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,960
 Mayeville's Introduction to the Communist Manifesto.

654
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,200
 Do it, do it.

655
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,080
 Oh, God, that does sound good though.

656
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,480
 I mean, yeah.

657
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,080
 That does sound good.

658
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,560
 You should do it and then pick it on the pod and we can talk about communism for an hour.

659
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,880
 I feel like I've learned a lot, yeah.

660
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,680
 Yeah.

661
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,080
 No, I've got to I'm reading 2023 books for nomination purposes for the next month.

662
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,280
 So yeah, so tell us what we should be reading.

663
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,880
 All these worlds reviews and essays by Neil Harrison.

664
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,480
 Oh, yeah.

665
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
 So I'm already on my list.

666
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,080
 I think I mean, I think this is a whole future episode, right?

667
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,480
 Should I be reading some things before I start?

668
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,880
 Basically, what should I be reading the next couple of weeks?

669
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,080
 Hmm.

670
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,280
 All these worlds reviews and essays by Neil Harrison.

671
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
 Is that helpful?

672
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,880
 I've read about half of it, actually.

673
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,080
 Wait.

674
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,680
 I'm looking for possibilities.

675
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,080
 You could try titanium mar by Nick Harkaway as picked by me on the podcast.

676
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,960
 Oh, I know.

677
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,280
 Hopeland by Ian McDonald's is on my list.

678
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
 Yeah.

679
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,280
 That's on my list as well.

680
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,880
 Well, it's on my list.

681
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,280
 The Saint of Bright Doors is on my list.

682
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,880
 I've read that.

683
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,080
 I don't know why I didn't pick it.

684
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,480
 I do know why I didn't pick it.

685
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,880
 I don't think I'll clever enough.

686
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,680
 All right.

687
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,480
 I did try to review of it on Goodreads.

688
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,280
 You should read Walking Practice by Dulce Minne as picked by me on a previous

689
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,880
 episode.

690
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,680
 I think there's a theme here.

691
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,480
 Yeah, no.

692
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,280
 It's almost like Liz has been picking the books that she thinks people should read.

693
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,080
 Yeah.

694
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,880
 Crazy.

695
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,280
 It will never catch on.

696
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,880
 I'll come up with some more later.

697
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
 But that's a start.

698
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,680
 Oh, have we got any more letters, John?

699
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
 No.

700
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,080
 So we finished the letter column for today.

701
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,280
 Do we have any other content for this episode?

702
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,280
 Because I've got things to do today like play board games and drink.

703
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,080
 I mean, you've already started one of those.

704
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,080
 That's true.

705
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,680
 That is true.

706
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
 You can multitask.

707
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
 You can podcast and drink.

708
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,480
 I mean, it's possible you can also podcast.

709
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,980
 You probably could have podcasted in the gaps between turns and terraforming

710
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,880
 Mars, probably.

711
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,080
 Oh, God, that would be quite funny.

712
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,280
 That was the ultimate podcast and it's goodbye from me.

713
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,080
 It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.

714
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,680
 And also happy new year to all our listeners, especially those who stuck

715
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,080
 with us for 100 episodes.

716
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,580
 Yes.

717
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,880
 Thank you to anyone.

718
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,400
 Yes. If you've listened to every episode, write in and I will buy you a

719
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,280
 pint.

720
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,080
 Read all the names out next time if it's not too many.

721
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:40,280
 Well, the first one to write in, I'll send a copy of all these worlds,

722
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,680
 reviews and essays by Neil Harrison.

723
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
 Really?

724
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,080
 That'll be Chris Garcia, you know.

725
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,880
 How are you?

726
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
 And international shipping.

727
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,880
 Oh, the second one to write in.

728
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,800
 Well, I hand carried a copy of all these worlds reviews and essays by Neil

729
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
 Harrison to the Bay Area.

730
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,400
 So possibly we can facilitate some kind of loan to Chris.

731
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,800
 Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe.

732
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,200
 Yes, but thank you to everyone who has stuck with us.

733
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,800
 We enjoyed doing the podcast.

734
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,200
 We hope you enjoy listening to it.

735
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
 We do.

736
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,200
 And it is a lot more enjoyable because you write in and tell us when you

737
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,200
 agree, when you disagree, when we're completely wrong, etc.

738
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,600
 So please keep doing that for 2024, especially if John's wrong.

739
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,400
 Yeah, no, I asked somebody at the party last night whether they listened

740
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,200
 to the first thought and they were like, it's not in my rotation,

741
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,400
 which I thought was a nice way of saying that's dull.

742
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,200
 That is a very diplomatic way of saying now.

743
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,400
 All right, shall we stop recording?

744
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
 Yeah, yeah, we can do that.

745
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,800
 Okay, okay.

746
00:39:41,800 --> 00:40:04,600
 I have played.

747
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,400
 I did play many board games.

748
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,000
 Oh, which ones?

749
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,000
 So we played, we finished off our advent calendar.

750
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,400
 Oh, yeah, Marianne had that.

751
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
 The exit one.

752
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
 Yeah, I really like them.

753
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,000
 They're great.

754
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,600
 So I'm like, that might be enough future.

755
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,000
 Played a lot of herd mentality, which is a popular choice around the holidays.

756
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,800
 It's a very popular party game, yes.

757
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,600
 Yes, it's very good.

758
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,400
 I like it a lot.

759
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,000
 And what else do we play?

760
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 Played to Kaido, played Paleo, played legendary, played Monica's, played Scout.

761
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,400
 And played final goal.

762
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,800
 Okay, apparently we played Bannanza quite a lot, which is a classic, I understand.

763
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
 Yep, it is.

764
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
 Uve Würzenberg.

765
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,000
 Yeah, and we played three player Bannanza and it was kind of pretty good.

766
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:03,200
 And I was getting to the end of the three player Bannanza and I was like, oh, I probably am getting, you know, we played about three or four games and I was like, okay, I probably had enough of this there.

767
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,800
 And then, and then we played it with four players and at that point, I went, oh, this is the,

768
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,600
 this is how it works.

769
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,800
 And then Jonathan, Jonathan hated it.

770
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:22,800
 So, you know, that's the problem with having a single gaming group is that you find that people go, oh, this doesn't work for me because it's much, it's much crunchier with four.

771
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,600
 You're putting a very difficult positions all the time, which I really like.

772
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:38,400
 And then we played Pandemic Iberia, Iberia, which was one of the games we got from Emily and Andrew, shout out to Emily and Andrew if they are listening, but they gave me a whole sack of games.

773
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,000
 In a kind of decluttering Santa.

774
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,600
 It's the old adage and listeners.

775
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,800
 This is words to live by.

776
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,400
 The easiest way to declutter is to give it to Alison.

777
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,800
 Yeah.

778
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,200
 Because and Alison has employed the reverse tactic with me.

779
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,400
 The easiest way to declutter is to give it to John.

780
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:00,800
 Yeah.

781
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
 Has also worked.

782
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:08,600
 Yep. Yep. I mean, I guess more generally what's old and stale to you is new and exciting to other people.

783
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,800
 So it can be it can be very good.

784
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,600
 I got three games from Emily and Andrew.

785
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,000
 I was very restrained.

786
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,600
 Oh, yeah.

787
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,600
 Which ones did you get Scotland Yard, Kalico and Kitchen Rush?

788
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,000
 Yeah.

789
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 So so we have about, I don't know, six or seven games from Emily and Andrew and we've played Pandemic Iberia, which obviously will keep and carry on playing and Mary Ann and I have played the mind, but we want to play it with all four of us.

790
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 So that's definitely one of the things we're going to do today.

791
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,800
 We're going to read each other's minds for you as day.

792
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,200
 Marianne and I lost the mind catastrophically.

793
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,000
 So, you know, and then I've played shot and Tottenham with both Stephen and with Marianne.

794
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 Anyway, this is games over Christmas.

795
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,200
 This which is off topic for the podcast probably.

796
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,000
 So, yeah, who knows?

797
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,200
 Well, if we're short, John can use this filler.

798
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,800
 Um, how many board games did you get from Emily and Andrew Liz?

799
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 I got zero board games from Emily and Andrew.

800
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,400
 Oh, boo.

801
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,280
 New conspiracy theory.

802
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,600
 Do Emily and Andrew hate Liz more on this as it unfolds.

803
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,400
