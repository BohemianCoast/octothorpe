1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 I'm- I'm operating on the assumption that someone somewhere must know what's going on.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,640
 And if I could only get them to tell me everything would be a lot better.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,320
 If you're the person who knows what's going on, do get in touch. Please email us.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,720
 Specifically, knows what's going on with John. That- that's a stretch.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
 [Laughing]

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:32,720
 [Music]

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:40,720
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 88th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,720
 brought to you on the 20th of July, 2023. I'm John Coxon.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,720
 I'm Alison Scott.

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,720
 And I'm Liz Batty.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,720
 So, we might have some new listeners today because we have been nominated for a Hugo.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,720
 And so we thought we would reintroduce ourselves for those of you that haven't started listening from episode one,

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,720
 which is the- is a good way of listening.

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,720
 So hello, I'm John Coxon. I am a science fiction fan residing in Newcastle, Blondheim in the UK.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,720
 By my day job, I am a space physicist and I play lots of games.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,720
 Hi, I'm Alison Scott. I'm a science fiction fan resident in North East London.

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,720
 I do a lot of different things. I do a lot of projects, which in the words of a Spanish sheriff,

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
 get me no ego boo and make no money. [Laughing]

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:39,720
 And I am currently the Guff delegate. So I'm going to be going to Australia and New Zealand to further international fan

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,720
 concord or whatever it is. The purpose of the fanfons is-

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 Hello, I'm Liz Batty. I'm a science fiction fan who's from the UK, but currently I live in Bangkok.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 And so there is always some exciting scheduling to be done for the podcast.

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,720
 I live in Bangkok because my day job is Tropical Medicine Research.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,720
 And the thing about Bangkok is the sun sets very quickly there.

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,720
 Yes, as previously established in previous podcasts, sometimes the sun is setting when we are doing the podcast

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,720
 and it sets very fast and this is very exciting to certain other people on the podcast.

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,720
 We probably don't have time to explain every in-joke now, but they'll probably become apparent and most of them are very silly.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,720
 I know it's one of the most annoying things about podcasts, isn't it?

29
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,720
 That you don't know who these people are and they have a load of in-jokes that you don't understand, so sorry.

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,720
 We would like to apologise from the bottom of our hearts.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
 So yes, hello everyone.

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,720
 And we have some letters of comments, so who wants to take the first letter of comment?

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,720
 Who's our first letter of comment? Is it Christopher J. Garcia? Did he write as a letter?

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 It is Christopher J. Garcia, Hugo finalist, Flintstonesshire wearer and general good egg.

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,720
 Yeah, and he reckons that he would absolutely take on Alison over Moose.

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,720
 One Moose? I mean, I think probably I'm probably not as dangerous as one Alison-sized Moose, really.

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:18,720
 No. And he also reckons that I need a cozy mystery series about me, maybe called the Back to the Criminal Detach Agency, which sounds pretty good.

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,720
 Writing listeners with fictional crimes.

39
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,720
 That would be the cover art if I hadn't already done it.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,720
 He does have a true crime book coming out. It's probably about to come about in the UK.

41
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,720
 It's called Food and Crime from Penn and Sword.

42
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 So if you're in the market for a book written by a man who owns at least one Flintstones t-shirt, that is the book for you.

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 So we also heard from Mark Plummer, who was very shocked to discover we'd changed the music.

44
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
 Had we changed the music, John?

45
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
 Well, it's the summer of fun.

46
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
 Summer of fun!

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,720
 It's our summer music. It's kind of our surf, our octaphor surfing corner.

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
 But on our summer outfits.

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 Yeah, because we all go surfing. Like, we do a surfing, not many people know this, but we do a surfing holiday as a three every year in the summer.

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,720
 Brainstorm, what the next year holds for octop.

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,720
 So that's a little inside, inside peek into the workings of the pod.

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,720
 So Mark wrote us, as always, a very long and extremely entertaining letter that we don't have time to read out all of.

53
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:36,720
 But I wanted to say he wrote about the reveling in the novelty of a fan-historical query about something of which I have first-hand knowledge, which is the BSFA non-fiction award.

54
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:46,720
 The original idea was that we opened to book length works and shorter pieces because there might not be enough book length and non-fiction works.

55
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:55,720
 And there was quite a lot of fiddling about with the eligibility, an experiment with a juried non-fiction award in 2006 where there was a winner but no shortlist.

56
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,720
 And in 2007 where there was a recommended reading list with no winner.

57
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:17,720
 And then also the back end of the Hugo voting, the Hugo nomination process, where when he and Claire did it, they started checking eligibility well before the end of the voting period because most of the things that end up on the ballot are represented in early votes.

58
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:31,720
 So we start checking the front-runners straight away and then he gives us a 21st century, Spanish aphorism. Dave McCarty says no more than seven of you can sit here.

59
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,720
 And I predict that no more than seven of our listeners will find that very funny indeed, which isn't up right.

60
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:50,720
 In that case, we also heard on Mastodon from Raj and Duncan. Duncan has disgraced himself when he knows what he did.

61
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 Raj congratulated us for our Hugo nomination. Lots of people congratulated us on our Hugo nomination.

62
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,720
 Thank you very much to everyone who got in touch.

63
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 Yes, so we also heard from Neil Harrison, a fandom researcher extraordinaire. Thank you, Neil, because he went and looked up after our discussion last time about Adam Roberts and how he never writes the same book twice, but also has never been nominated for a Hugo.

64
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:30,720
 And then when I looked up what books Adam has out that might be eligible and he's got, basically he's just released one more near future techno thriller, which I've just bought.

65
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:42,720
 And then he's got what appears to be a sort of maybe fantasy crime novel. And then the year after that he's got what sounds like sort of a straight space mystery space opera.

66
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 Anyway, basically he's got another three books out over the next like two and a half years. And they all sound great and they all sound entirely different. So we'll see how that goes.

67
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
 Who does he think he is? Adrian Charkovsky?

68
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:10,720
 Yeah, I'll put all the books in the show notes. Thank you very much to everyone who wrote in. Oh, I was going to say, and I completely forgot that last episode we mentioned that the next special episode we're doing will be us reading six weeks.

69
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:22,720
 And I was going through dimensions and I found when we, I must have mentioned it to Laurie from the Hugo Girl podcast because she really liked it and is trying to persuade them to do an episode on it.

70
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
 Well, that's quite good.

71
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
 Tune in episode. That will be quite fun, actually.

72
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 Oh, they should do that. If it is at the same time as we did it.

73
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
 Oh, a collab.

74
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,720
 Chris Garcia in his log said he quite enjoyed it. You will have to wait to see what we thought of it listeners for shadowing.

75
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:51,720
 Shall we talk about another email that we received this week?

76
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,720
 Alison and I received it, but I don't believe Liz did.

77
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
 I did not receive it.

78
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,720
 Yes, this is the email from levitation inviting people to.

79
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,720
 It's not even fill in a survey, is it? It's inviting people to sign up to fill in a survey that will be coming later.

80
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
 Have I got that right?

81
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,720
 Yeah, so they are planning a COVID survey, which is something we've been saying they should do. So that's good.

82
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:31,720
 And they want to make sure that they hit more people than just their own membership, but they also want to make sure that they don't let people fill the survey in multiple times because they're worried about ballot stuffing.

83
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,720
 And so they have released a link you can click on if you would like to be invited to fill in the survey when it goes live.

84
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,720
 So I've put link in the show notes. If that sounds like something you would be interested, dear listener.

85
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,720
 Yes, in order to fill in the survey, you need to have attended Eastercon at least once.

86
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,720
 That's the that's what they've done is that's how they've decided they're going to do the boundaries of the community, which I think is not totally unreasonable.

87
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:05,720
 That does mean that they are excluding people who have always always wanted to go to EasterCon, but it's never quite been the year until food was going to be the year, but only if they have the right COVID policy.

88
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
 Sorry guys, you're disenfranchised.

89
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,720
 I mean, actually it's levitation members and UK based fans are attended past EasterCon.

90
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,720
 So in theory that excludes any visiting members.

91
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
 Yes.

92
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
 Any UK based fan who has attended one or more Eastercons.

93
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 Do you count this?

94
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,720
 Oh, that's a good question. No, I don't.

95
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 Can't flit in.

96
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,720
 So, so Liz, you have to be personally disenfranchised by levitation the swines.

97
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
 Have you ever been to an EasterCon?

98
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
 Uh, one or two.

99
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
 Yeah.

100
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:50,720
 But yeah, no, it's stuffed because like I can understand that you don't want international fans who haven't attended Eastercons to contribute, but people like Liz or Bill Burns or other long standing members who might not have signed up.

101
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
 I mean, Bill will have done, but that's a bad example.

102
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,720
 But yeah, if you're if you're a previous international attendee who has opinions, it seems like you should be able to comment.

103
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
 I don't know.

104
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 That's odd.

105
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,720
 I think about like Irish fans, quite a lot of Irish fans come to the EasterCon.

106
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
 Yes.

107
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,720
 That's a big, big obvious problem, isn't it?

108
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
 I think so.

109
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:22,720
 Because I mean, now a day, I mean, okay, for the last 30 years there has been a national Irish convention, but before that, there wasn't a lot of Irish fans felt that the EasterCon was the national convention.

110
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
 Oh, we're going to get so many of that as.

111
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,720
 It's, I think I can see what they're trying to do, which is they pick up most of the regular Eastern Congroids because they will be members of levitation.

112
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:40,720
 And what they're going to lose here is a small number of people who maybe regularly attend Eastercons live overseas, but have not yet joined levitation, which to be honest is probably a very small number.

113
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
 It may just be me.

114
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:53,720
 But I will say the reason I'm not a member of levitation is I assume I'm not going to levitation because I'm going to Glasgow in 2024, and I would not be surprised if there's a lot of people who are currently planning on skipping levitation for that reason.

115
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
 Yeah, so, oh, I don't have to fill it up for them.

116
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
 It's fine.

117
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,720
 I can call the episode something like Eastercons, spurns, liz, personally.

118
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
 [laughs]

119
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
 Yes, just me on my own.

120
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
 [moans]

121
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 We really are going to get letters.

122
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,720
 We had some thoughts about the survey.

123
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,720
 Here's what I reckon listeners in the true spirit of what I thought.

124
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,720
 I think you want to make sure this survey does three things.

125
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
 I think you want to avoid yes or no answers.

126
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
 You want to have one to five scales.

127
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,720
 Yes, when I want to have a recipe for trouble, one to five scales are better.

128
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
 One to four scales are even better.

129
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
 No, one to five.

130
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
 You need one where it has a middle.

131
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 Okay, so there is an argument to be had about whether you want the scale that has the middle, which encourages people to be in the middle, or whether you have the scale that doesn't have the middle, which encourages people to express a preference.

132
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
 I don't think you want to...

133
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,720
 The problem with not having a scale with the middle is it forces people into preferences if they don't have them, which distorts your data.

134
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,720
 So we're told quite strongly not to do it in public engagement because it means you don't accurately capture what your audience thinks.

135
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,720
 There's just one question at the top saying, "I genuinely do not care and I do not want to fill in the rest of the survey."

136
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,720
 Well, that is, you can abstain, obviously, if you just have no preference.

137
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 But yes, and I also think they need to make sure that they say it's non-binding because you don't want to do a Brexit.

138
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:22,720
 What they have said is, we will, of course, use the results to inform levitations COVID policy, but we will not necessarily just pick the average result and implement that.

139
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
 Yeah, that seems good.

140
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
 Which seems fair.

141
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 That seems sensible to me anyway.

142
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
 Liz, do you have opinions?

143
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,720
 I think you've covered them, which is, yeah, have a scale rather than yes or no.

144
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,720
 I think do allow people to genuinely not have an opinion on this one because you don't want to kind of force people one way or the other.

145
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:57,720
 You want to know people genuinely don't care because if there's a bit of policy you're considering implementing and you have ten people on one end who feel very strongly in favour of it and ten people on the other end who feel very strongly against it, but 80 people in the middle who don't care, then that's different than if you genuinely do have 50/50 polarised.

146
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
 Yeah, so I think that's good.

147
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,720
 I think it's going to be a lot of work to try and summarise it and I think it's going to be interesting to see kind of what questions they pick.

148
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:15,720
 And what might also be interesting would be to be instead of having one to five scales on things, maybe give people different scenarios or different options and get them to say which is the most favoured and least favoured.

149
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,720
 But yeah, I'm not a survey, survey making expert.

150
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:28,720
 I just think it will be interesting to know, yeah, to know what we get and since they've emailed it to everyone, hopefully that will reach a lot of the kind of community.

151
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
 Fingers crossed.

152
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
 Yeah.

153
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,720
 [Music]

154
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,720
 The Hugo Awards finalists are out.

155
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
 We're on it.

156
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
 We are on it.

157
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
 Yay! Thanks everyone who voted.

158
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,720
 We said that, well thanks to anyone who nominated, we said that last time we'll say it again because we really are.

159
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,720
 It's always a pleasure to be nominated, especially on the same ballot as our lovely friends, Hugo Girl.

160
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,720
 And my lovely wife, Ispania.

161
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
 That is nice.

162
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,720
 I like being on the same ballot as your lovely wife, Ispania.

163
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:17,720
 Very, very nice that Ispania's on the ballot and I am also on the ballot for fan artist and someone wrote and said, "What you have terrible arguments in the octaphore pazzles?"

164
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
 And I would have thought we wouldn't have any really.

165
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,720
 We'd just kind of vote for who we think is best.

166
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
 Yeah.

167
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,720
 The only person who's going to have an argument is Liz in her own head.

168
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,720
 Yeah, I mean, well it's ranked choice voting, but I also might not tell you who I vote for and who I put in which position is best fan artist.

169
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,720
 I assume that you'll declare it live on the pod with both me and Alison Geering.

170
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
 [Laughs]

171
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
 No?

172
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
 Oh, people can vote who they like, right?

173
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
 I was like, you know.

174
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,720
 That's actually not true. They have to vote for people on the ballot.

175
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
 It's true.

176
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
 Yeah.

177
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
 Yeah.

178
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
 You can't write in listeners.

179
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,720
 It varies from WILCOME site suspension in Lamberingard.

180
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
 Yup.

181
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:08,720
 So yeah, no vote for who you want. I don't think, I mean, I am very, this is my first time ever having an interventional nomination, so I am pretty pleased because I've been doing fan art for quite a long time.

182
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
 And I'm also very pleased to see Ispania on the ballot.

183
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,720
 And I'm going to make my joke now, which is it's really good to have an actual fan artist on the ballot.

184
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,720
 So for anyone who's not familiar with Ispania's work, she paints lovely fans.

185
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
 So she does, she does.

186
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
 They're very good. I have one. It's got a Death Star on it.

187
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
 So I was just going to say that I won the bet.

188
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
 You did. You did.

189
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,720
 That's only because I decided like, I thought we were all not going to bet and then at the end you decided it was still a bet.

190
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
 [Laughs]

191
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,720
 So yes, technically, I'll buy you a beer.

192
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
 There's... Yeah.

193
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
 But yes, there are some Chinese things on there.

194
00:15:48,720 --> 00:16:05,720
 Although I do think a lot of what we said still stands up because there were people who were really ringing like bells of whoa about how it would all be like, you know, I had at least one person say that they'd have more time for their summer reading because nothing on the ballot would be in English.

195
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,720
 And I think that some of the fear mongering has not come to pass, which makes it.

196
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,720
 Which are the categories that have Chinese works in Liz?

197
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,720
 There are two nominees in Best Fan Writer.

198
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,720
 There are two in Best Fan Zine.

199
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,720
 I think there are two in Best Editor Long Form.

200
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
 I'm not sure about Pro Artist.

201
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
 Two in Best Editor Short Form.

202
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,720
 I believe Pro Artist and Fan Writer both have at least one Chinese novel.

203
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:43,720
 I think they do, and then in Best Short Story, I believe there are four Chinese stories that the six on the ballot.

204
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,720
 At least one of those I know as a translation that's going to be published this year, so hopefully some of those will be out in translation.

205
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,720
 There's one in Best Novelt, and that is it.

206
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
 One in Best Related Work as well.

207
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,720
 I don't know. I didn't think you said that by my be wrong.

208
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
 I didn't. I zoomed straight past it. Sorry. There is one in Best Related Work.

209
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,720
 Yeah. So there's a smattering, but it's not an overwhelming deluge.

210
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:16,720
 And it's notable that the longer fiction is completely, like those two, novella and novel look like they could have been at any world gone in the last decade.

211
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 In general, I'm sure people will crunch this when the long list comes out.

212
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 The categories where you've required more nominations to get on the ballot have lower numbers of Chinese finalists,

213
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,720
 which is kind of what you'd expect. I think they probably did get quite a lot of balance from Chinese fans,

214
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,720
 but I'm not sure that the Chinese fans are quite as organized about having lists of recommended things for people to ever think about

215
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,720
 and all of that stuff as the US and UK fans yet.

216
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 So that is not true in certain categories, right? Because unfortunately, generally, we know that there are very few nominations in Best Fan Artists,

217
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,720
 and that is entirely Western nominees.

218
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,720
 I don't think Alison is saying it that way round, if that makes sense.

219
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 I mean, she's saying that all of the ones where there's a Chinese presence are low totals rather than all of the low total ones have Chinese nominees.

220
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 Well, and I think you are probably right, but I will say, I think in short story, it's because I think probably there are a lot of nominators,

221
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,720
 but we do know that there's a really long tail in short story and there is every year.

222
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,720
 So I think short story behaves differently to other categories, but for different reasons.

223
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,720
 But I still think it's like a worthwhile thing to highlight. Sorry, Liz, I interrupted you.

224
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 Yeah, I think that's fair. Like, yes, they were not going to get enough to get anything on the, there was not enough to get things on the ballot,

225
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:47,720
 and like, best novel where you need really kind of over, probably about 120 last year to get on the ballot.

226
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,720
 Yeah, it's interesting because last year, you know, it wasn't that much different for short story and novel yet,

227
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
 but I guess there's one novel yet and four short stories.

228
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,720
 Yeah, and there's nothing in long form, so there's nothing in best series or load star either.

229
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,720
 You mentioned Chinese recommendations and stuff, Alison, I think.

230
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:14,720
 And I just wanted to highlight, there was someone on Twitter called Ersatkulture, who posted a link to a recommendation post in Chinese

231
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,720
 where like some people had clearly been thinking, "Oh, you know, what's eligible in the style of kind of some of the recommendation posts."

232
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,720
 Which seemed to have died off a little bit in the English speaking fan spiers.

233
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 I exist in, but used to be very common when I was first paying attention.

234
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,720
 It's tricky because I thought this was really interesting, but I didn't like the framing.

235
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,720
 I tooted at the person who posted about this, and they said, "Don't you think the categories were one or two wrecks,

236
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 and that they all appeared on the eventual list match what's expected of a bullet slate strategy in EPH?"

237
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:54,720
 And honestly, no, I think there is a massive difference between people in a fandom discussing things they might nominate.

238
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,720
 Like, there is a clear difference between this and the recommendation posts that used to be posted by critics in the English Bogosphere

239
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
 and the sort of thing that the puppies were doing.

240
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
 I was really encouraged to see this.

241
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,720
 I think it's really good that the Chinese voters were discussing what was eligible and corralling behind things that they all liked.

242
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,720
 Remember that we had the bulkiest of bullet nominations.

243
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,720
 When we didn't quite cut it on the ballot the first year, I think we had an enormous proportion of nominations

244
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,720
 from people who didn't nominate anything else who fang lost.

245
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,720
 We are the problem. We may not be the problem.

246
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,720
 So that's the thing. If you know, if you're voting for you guys and you've never voted before

247
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,720
 and you were looking for Chinese language recommendation lists and you found one and it only had a couple of things on

248
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,720
 one particular category and you looked at them and thought, "Oh, these are great. I'll nominate them."

249
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,720
 Yeah, they're more likely to get on the "if you nominated" six things.

250
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
 Yeah, that's just how it works.

251
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:55,720
 I will say that there was, as we mentioned, there was a little leak of the ballot before the final ballot was actually, you know?

252
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 Shh, we're not allowed to tell anyone, Liz. It was a secret.

253
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
 It was a secret.

254
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
 No one saw it.

255
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
 No one saw it apart from...

256
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
 I think everyone saw it.

257
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
 Yeah, I saw it in the screen, shouted it. Anyway...

258
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
 Ha ha ha ha!

259
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:18,720
 There was one item on there that was in that recommendation post and it's not eligible because the year it wasn't actually a 2022 release.

260
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,720
 So that's what made me think, "Oh, actually this recommendation post probably was quite influential and maybe sparked quite a lot of discussion."

261
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,720
 But unfortunately, they put some of their nominating weight behind an item that was released in 2020.

262
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,720
 In the spirit of full disclosure, we should note that some of the things that we have recommended people to already are on the ballot.

263
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
 So...

264
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
 But that's because they're good.

265
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
 Yeah.

266
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
 Don't think we have that much power.

267
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,720
 Well, it's interesting, in Best Fan Artist, that is Fan Your Analysis and are both first-time finalists.

268
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:57,720
 So potentially, potentially, we have the power of "In Best Fan Artist" which last year needed 15 nominations.

269
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,720
 Yes, I think we have more than 15 listeners who nominate in the Hugos.

270
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
 I think we get influenced 15 people.

271
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,720
 Whereas, you know, some of the other things I championed are on the ballot, but I don't think that had anything at all to do with it.

272
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 So...

273
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
 Yeah, that's fair, that's fair.

274
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:21,720
 Yeah, I mean, I personally like the fact that Fan Artist is swinging back towards people who are doing what I think of as Fan Artists, so that's quite nice.

275
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
 I mean, that just meant being B, right?

276
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:38,720
 But, I mean, we mean two totally different things by "Phall Art" at the moment, which is art that is done by fans to illustrate their "Phallac" and which is the traditional definition, and art for fans of a thing.

277
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:47,720
 And that second definition has been kind of becoming much more prevalent in the "Phall Art" - "Phall Artist" nominations, and it's nice to see people who do more of the first sort of thing.

278
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
 Getting a look in.

279
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,720
 It's a good C variety in all of the... I like that kind of variety in all the categories.

280
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:03,720
 I like having, like, Bitter Corella has been nominated again, and I very much like their stuff, but it's a completely different style of fan writer to Chris Spartley.

281
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,720
 It would be difficult to imagine them being more different. I suppose they're both in English.

282
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:17,720
 Speaking of people who are not in English, Arthur Liu, who has got a "Dobbed in Fan writer", is one of the people I spent quite a lot of time chatting to.

283
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,720
 At "Discone" in the Discord is one of the Chinese fans that I got to know.

284
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,720
 I just wanted to call out "Best Series" this year for being absolutely stacked.

285
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
 Oh yeah, yeah, it's been "Lifton".

286
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:40,720
 I honestly do not know which one I'm putting at the top of the ballot. I've read items from five of the six finalists.

287
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,720
 Yeah, I don't know which one I'm going to vote. That's going to be really tricky.

288
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:52,720
 And honestly, unless "Best Novel" has some absolutely smashing stuff in it, I think "Best Series" might be the best category on the ballot.

289
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:02,720
 Oh, it's "Best Series" that I thought the opt-of-thaw massive might have had a sway, because we did tell people to get on and vote for Rivers of London and Children of Time.

290
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 I don't think we can claim either, really, because Rivers of London has been on before, and Children of Time is just objectively fucking brilliant.

291
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 But yes, I mean, we do have great taste though. We should say that early and often.

292
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,720
 I mean, I did tell people to vote for Robert Jackson Bennett about 27 times, but I'm not sure I've seen notice.

293
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
 Yes.

294
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,720
 I was wondering about that. I was like, "I think Liz mentioned that maybe early and often."

295
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,720
 For the listener, you cannot see the shit-eating grin that Alison is doing to tease Liz.

296
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:46,720
 I will say, I don't want to diss you, Liz, but the reason I read Robert Jackson Bennett is because he appeared on the "Best Series" shortlist for his previous trilogy, which was also very good.

297
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,720
 He did, and obviously, if I had any sway, then he would have been on the "Best Novel" ballot, which he's not, so...

298
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,720
 No, I will say it. So I think it is very cool that the "Best Series" finalists look so good.

299
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,720
 And as an avowed "Best Series" fan, it makes me happy.

300
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,720
 Do we have anything else on those things?

301
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,720
 I'm sure I'll have more to say once we get round to reading and watching and listening to more of these,

302
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,720
 and we hope that a lot of them will be in the Hugo packet, because spoilers, there will be a Hugo packet,

303
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,720
 and we know because they've asked us what we would like to put in the Hugo packet.

304
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:34,720
 So listeners, if you have any suggestions for particularly great episodes of "Optus Orp" released in 2022, then tell us them, we might consider putting them in the Hugo packet.

305
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
 Yeah, "Slinger" right over.

306
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,720
 I was going to say I've been a fan of Travis Baldre- I haven't read "Legends and Luttays",

307
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:51,720
 but I've been a fan of Travis Baldre for a very, very long time because, um, ever since he was a kind of very baby video game designer and designed a dungeon crawler called "Fate",

308
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,720
 which was like Diablo, but much, much cuter, which it wasn't very narrative.

309
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:06,720
 So, I mean, his games that I really liked were "Fate" and "Torchlight" and "Torchlight 2", and none of them have much narrative to speak of, so, you know, now he's a novelist, so...

310
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,720
 But it's good to see people, um, making that switch from game design to novel writing.

311
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,720
 I played "Torchlight" and did enjoy it and had not realised the connection until he mentioned it underscored, so...

312
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:25,720
 Speaking of the Hugo voter packet, one author who won't be putting things in the packet is "S B Divya".

313
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,720
 Boom, a segue, because they have declined their Hugo nominations.

314
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,720
 And they wrote a thoughtful blog post about why they had done that.

315
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:46,720
 Yeah, I mean, we should probably, we should probably summarise briefly why she did decline them, which is, she essentially declined them as a protest against hosting.

316
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,720
 The 2023 Wilcon in China.

317
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,720
 And, you know, it is not possible to run something as large as a Wilcon without government involvement.

318
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:06,720
 And so, you know, there is some government involvement in the Wilcon, and also that, you know, as we've said before, one of the guests of honor is an apologist for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

319
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:15,720
 And so, "Divya felt it was best to withdraw her items from consideration and not participate in the future."

320
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:28,720
 Which, yeah, I think is a very, very principled stance to basically give up, give up potentially winning an award, because I think she did have a very good novelt last year that might have sort of chance of winning to make her principled stand.

321
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:37,720
 My wife also wrote a blog post about her thoughts and conflicts on accepting the nomination, so I've linked to that in the show notes as well.

322
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,720
 We have not blogged about it. What do we think about accepting our nomination, peeps?

323
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,720
 We didn't really have much of a discussion, we just kind of went, "Yeah, we're going to do that."

324
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,720
 Yes. Are we morally bankrupt as people?

325
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
 Discuss.

326
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,720
 Oh, that's as much wider question than just the hue-anomination.

327
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,720
 (Laughter)

328
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:10,720
 I essentially can see all the reasons for declining the nomination, but equally, my reasons for not, whether it is, you know, a fan voted award and fans from around the world have voted on it.

329
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:23,720
 And I didn't feel that by accepting the nomination, I was therefore kind of endorsing or implicitly supporting any of the, you know, wider policies or opinions around the world come.

330
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
 I think that is well put.

331
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,720
 They did translate the name of our podcast as Poundkey Sign, which I think is absolutely fine.

332
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 Yes.

333
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:40,720
 And they also translate the names phonetically, as far as I can tell, and it seemed like my analysis were quite good and John's not quite so good.

334
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
 Which is quite neat, actually. It's quite neat to have a phonetic translation of my name.

335
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
 Yeah.

336
00:28:44,720 --> 00:29:02,720
 It's again, I don't know if this is probably a little bit obstrut- they should have asked us about that, because if you've done any studying of Chinese at all, you will have a Chinese name in the same way that all the Chinese fans have western names like Riverflow and Arthur.

337
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,720
 And Arthur Liu, yeah. They're all kind of pseudonyms for dealing with the west.

338
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,720
 And if you start to learn Chinese, they get you to do that in reverse.

339
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
 So people probably already have them.

340
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,720
 Quite a lot of people are on the nomination list, but they just kind of published a phonetic translation instead.

341
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
 I think a lot of people have them.

342
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
 Some.

343
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
 They should have asked.

344
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,720
 But they were very tight for time. I think they were very tight for time.

345
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
 Yeah, they got no time. So, yeah.

346
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,720
 [Music]

347
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,720
 We're going to segue to Chengdu Worldcon discussion.

348
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:46,720
 So, there has been an email asking for people to fill out the program participant survey if they would like to take part in program.

349
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,720
 I don't know if you two are members or not. I remember because I was- I voted in site selection.

350
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
 Yeah, me too.

351
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,720
 Are you going to fill in the program survey, Liz?

352
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
 I tried to.

353
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
 Oh.

354
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,720
 But I haven't actually managed to get it to work.

355
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
 Ah.

356
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
 So, I think it's just the website is a bit slow.

357
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:15,720
 And so I've managed to get on there, but it never managed to send me a reset password email in time for me to actually coordinate getting back on there and resetting my password.

358
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
 So, I haven't done anything yet.

359
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
 Okay.

360
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,720
 I'm like, I'm not sure. I've got- I've paid any attention to this email.

361
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,720
 It's probably in your spam. I was in the spam with a big red warning about how it was a scam and I shouldn't click on it.

362
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 [Laughs]

363
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,720
 I mean, I do get- I've had a few emails through.

364
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,720
 Oh yeah, but this one in particular, the link does not go to the actual Planorama instance on the Chengdu website.

365
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,720
 It has a very long and obfuscated URL of the sort that makes you think you probably shouldn't click on it.

366
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
 Yeah. No, I did notice that.

367
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
 Which, you know, is a choice.

368
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,720
 It's tricky because I'm sure part of the problems they're having with email.

369
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,720
 It's clearly because they're from China and that's bad.

370
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,720
 But some of the things they're having with email are clearly slight own goals in this kind of way.

371
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,720
 Which, if I was there, I'd be doing my utmost to try and make sure every email was bulletproof.

372
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,720
 And they really seem to be doing that.

373
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,720
 So it's tricky because I'm sure part of that is Western imperialism, but yeah.

374
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 Oh, it contains a suspicious link that was used to steal people's personal information.

375
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,720
 Exactly. So I assume the domain it's using is one that has been used by scammers and that is probably not helping them.

376
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
 No.

377
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,720
 Yes, so that's Henry Bailin said their domain is on a spam list, on a block list.

378
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,720
 So about 20% of the internet just blocks everything.

379
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:49,720
 So if you're hoping to fill this survey in and you don't think you've received this email, we encourage you to check your spam folder listeners.

380
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,720
 Alison, you are going virtually. Is that right?

381
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,720
 I'm intending to. It all depends. I mean, I intend to go virtually, but it depends what the virtual offering is like.

382
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,720
 Because if it is just watching a lot of program items in the to taking place in enormous conference said to halls.

383
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,720
 I'm not sure I'm very interested in that.

384
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,720
 Possibly one of the people who went on the stuff weekend, which was a stuff week and in Chengdu.

385
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,720
 One of those people said they've seen a mock up of the virtual convention suite and it looked amazing.

386
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,720
 So who knows?

387
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,720
 I've got a free virtual membership. So I probably will sign up and watch some stuff and see what's going on.

388
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,720
 But I'm not sure how much time I'd actually spend on it.

389
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,720
 But it is basically my time zone. So it really happens.

390
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
 Interesting. There's also a tweet. Alison wanted to talk about.

391
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,720
 Yeah, it's about stars and something or other.

392
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:51,720
 Yeah, well, if I've actually had a request to fill in the program survey and I've seen it, this tweet wouldn't have been so strange.

393
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,720
 But it was the first I'd heard of how you could participate in the program.

394
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,720
 And it's, I think it's saying we're particularly looking for items on a theme.

395
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:11,720
 But it's been, there's some cultural baggage attached to that, which means that once it got translated into English, it didn't make very much sense to me.

396
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:18,720
 They want you to register for a panel, a party or a fan table on the theme of the stars and the sea.

397
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,720
 And they're going to reward people who do this.

398
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:29,720
 The activity you initiated will be compiled into the corresponding page of the WILCOM publication, which I think means we'll put it in the program.

399
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:42,720
 Yeah. And the committee will set up a signature wall for recording your messages to our WILCOM from the debut day on the courage and perseverance of your honor will be etched among the stars throughout the wall.

400
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,720
 I think this means your name will be written in the stars and then there'll be like presents and prizes.

401
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,720
 And there's going to be another plan, a hundredth light second plan.

402
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,720
 So there are going to be more themes of this kind.

403
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:06,720
 Although I do not understand it at all, I'm quite excited that they're thinking of themes that are not just the history of Chinese science fiction.

404
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:14,720
 I mean, I'm sure they'll be doing some of that stuff as well, but I like having more nebulous themes that you could get some creativity going around if it works.

405
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,720
 But I think a lot of people will look at this and go, "I don't understand it."

406
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:27,720
 I don't feel ready from that tweet to make a proposal for something in the lines of the stars and the sea. Let's put it that way.

407
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:35,720
 If I was to guess based on this tweet, I assume it's a call for fan table. But that doesn't quite seem to be what's going on.

408
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,720
 They said that you should contact them about panels and themed exhibitions. So...

409
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
 Yes, everything.

410
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,720
 I mean, I think something is definitely a bit lost in translation.

411
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:52,720
 If anyone involved with Chengdu has any more information on the stars and the sea co-proposals, please write in, because we would be interesting to know.

412
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,720
 Okay, so we'd be asking people who were involved in Chengdu to write in for about the last year at this point.

413
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,720
 And I think we have to conclude that nobody involved in Chengdu in any capacity is listening to this podcast.

414
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,720
 Apart from obviously the Chinese government, but only as far as they listen to everything.

415
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,720
 Yeah, we're the Hugo fans. Maybe one or two more people are listening.

416
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
 Oh, that'd be good.

417
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,720
 [Music]

418
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
 Do you want to pick a book?

419
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:29,720
 Yeah. I would like to pick Plutoshine by Lucy Kisack, which is one of the Clark Award nominees.

420
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,720
 And I ordered it from the library and they've got it for me.

421
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,720
 And I read it straight away because it's quite an easy read.

422
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:51,720
 It is a book about a colony on Pluto that has decided to go in for a bit of terraforming, so it gets some terraformers in from Earth and they do some terraforming.

423
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,720
 And that's half of the plot of the book.

424
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,720
 And obviously, you know, science happens and things go wrong because, you know, it's a book.

425
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:12,720
 And the other half of the book is that is about a little girl and her rather elder brother and their father, who discovers something that looks very much like extraterrestrial life.

426
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,720
 And I mean, you learned that bit in the first couple of pages of the book.

427
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:28,720
 And as a result of that, the father is in a coma and the little girl isn't communicated with anyone at the start of the book and her bigger brother is also damaged, but she's not obviously how.

428
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,720
 And that's the other half of the book is what has happened to them and why.

429
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:43,720
 And some way in which it's told is that one of the terraformers forms a friendship with the little girl and starts working out how he can get her to communicate more.

430
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
 And you may have already spotted from this.

431
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,720
 This is quite an old fashioned sort of science fiction book.

432
00:36:49,720 --> 00:37:01,720
 Luca Kissak is a young woman who has a PhD in planetary science from Oxford and so knows where off she speaks in terms of having lots of kind of good pluto science stuff about it.

433
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:09,720
 It's probably a bit too sciencey for me and a bit too simple for me now, but I would have loved this book when I was 12.

434
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:24,720
 If you think the science fiction isn't as a science-y and space-explory and interesting things going on with extraterrestrial lifey in the far reaches of the solar system, as it was when you were a child, this is definitely the book for you.

435
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
 And I quite liked it.

436
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:32,720
 But as I said, it is strangely old fashioned. It's not like a lot of the other science fiction books that I read now.

437
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:46,720
 I don't think it has the obvious failings that I think something like Project Hail Mary, which is also a book that people say this off, has, I think it isn't falling into those traps quite.

438
00:37:46,720 --> 00:38:01,720
 And it's possible that the author is a Mary Sue self-insert into our own universe as she is an attractive young woman with a PhD in planetary science whose first novel was picked up by Delance and has a successful YouTube channel.

439
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,720
 But apparently some people are like this.

440
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,720
 She can't be that good a planetary physicist because she doesn't know pluto isn't a planet.

441
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:20,720
 Hey, oh, it's a bit weird. Why is she necessarily like an intern from another world just because she has a PhD as a young woman and has a YouTube channel?

442
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,720
 And her first book got picked up by Delance, though Kerry says this happens all the time.

443
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
 Yeah.

444
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,720
 Yeah, it's quite specific, isn't it?

445
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:38,720
 Yeah, you write a book and rather than tout it round all the publishers forever, it gets published, I get on the award short lists and there you go.

446
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:47,720
 Yeah, it was that bit of exciting success because I know a lot of authors and most of them, this is not the way their career is got.

447
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:56,720
 So, I mean, I've also read pluto shine and you will know I didn't pick pluto shine because I thought it was pretty rubbish.

448
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:10,720
 Oh, okay, I mean, I judge it more harshly because it is on the Clark short list, but I don't know why it is on the Clark short list unless someone just really, really likes kind of like solar system based SF and there's nothing else they could choose to pick.

449
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:21,720
 I just thought it was poorly written, weak, you know, there's supposed like a big part of the plot hinges around kind of, you know, should we terraform pluto.

450
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:30,720
 But there's very that there's a very minimal, ever actual discussion of it. Like, I don't know. And there's some giant like plop contrivances.

451
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,720
 And then at the end, I mean giant plop contrivance being how can I kind of say it's without spoilers.

452
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,720
 But the bit where one of the characters thinks, oh, I can't find my magical McGuffin. Maybe I should check up on where that is.

453
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:54,720
 And then it turns out that the magical McGuffin is being used to sabotage the entire project and no one thought, oh, maybe we shouldn't leave these magical McGuffins that can sabotage the entire project hanging around.

454
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:04,720
 Oh, I didn't have a problem with that, but I just, I mean, I do think like, yeah, it did not feel strongly plotted.

455
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:19,720
 I thought the characterization in places was a bit weak, and I thought quite a lot of the writing was like, there's some terrible similes in there. And also it's not got that kind of, when there's kind of lots of kind of action going on, there's lots of things happening, there's lots of characters moving, there's events happening.

456
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:27,720
 It doesn't have that kind of clarity of writing that let me know what was going on all times. I was like, I don't actually know what is happening here.

457
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,720
 And it's also kind of curiously easy to live on Pluto.

458
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
 Yeah, no, that is true.

459
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:45,720
 There's no kind of, doesn't mean there's any kind of sort of difficulties. We just suddenly are able to kind of magically have a space base on Pluto where they have, you know, a forest full of trees and got all their own food and...

460
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
 And there's 70 of them, yeah.

461
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,720
 I have not read this. I've only read the tweets about it that people posted in a Discord I'm on.

462
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:04,720
 I can't remember which Discord was a Discord, but basically a comment was, but there was someone who was very angry about the metaphors that Liz mentioned.

463
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:12,720
 And they posted a lot of screenshots of how dare anything with this metaphor beyond an award short list.

464
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:22,720
 No, so the one, the one I, the one that sticks in the head, I get very frustrated when people post out of context experts on Twitter bid, like, how bad is this?

465
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,720
 It's like, well, it does, I do sometimes think these things do sometimes work better in context than they do when accepted and put on Twitter.

466
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:36,720
 Equally, the fridge magnet metaphor is the one that sticks in my head as being like, what is happening?

467
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,720
 She had all the retention of a magnet among fridges.

468
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
 It's...

469
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
 I don't understand what that means.

470
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,720
 Don't know what that means. And it's not the way taking it out of context.

471
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,720
 I mean, I do understand what it means because I kind of infer it.

472
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,720
 I know what they want it to mean, but I'm not sure it does.

473
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:02,720
 And yeah, I can't agree with you in that it kind of, you know, scratches a bit of that itch of like, I don't know, reading the old Heinlein juvenile as a teenager.

474
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,720
 Yeah, Hugh Walters. This could have been Hugh Walters' juvenile.

475
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,720
 But I don't read those anymore, so yeah.

476
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:18,720
 It's the same thing we said, I think, in the Hugo episode from last year, which is, I enjoyed reading Project Hail Mary,

477
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
 but I did not think it was good.

478
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
 And I think those are important.

479
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
 That is an important separation.

480
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,720
 You can have fun with a nonsense book while being able to criticize all the things that were wrong with it.

481
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:35,720
 Like, Project Hail Mary was fluff, but it was enjoyable fluff with a cool rock alien thing.

482
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,720
 And if I thought about it too hard, it made me sad, so I just didn't.

483
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,720
 I did not want to throw it across the room anything like as much as I wanted to throw.

484
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,720
 This is the kind of brick velocity test for novels, right?

485
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,720
 Listeners, please write in with the book you've thrown furthest across a room.

486
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,720
 It's a combination of density of book as well.

487
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,720
 So if you throw a big book across the room, you're not going to get it quite as far as if you throw a nice light little book like that.

488
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,720
 So this one could go a long, long way.

489
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,720
 Yeah, so I think we found that the key difference between us is that Alison,

490
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,720
 can't say this is a super good book, but did enjoy reading it.

491
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,720
 Don can't say Project Hail Mary is a really good book, but did enjoy reading it.

492
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,720
 I didn't enjoy reading either of them.

493
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:25,720
 I think, I think, if we had been forced to have a think about which of us,

494
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,720
 I don't think listeners will be surprised if they've been listening for a while.

495
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
 And if this is your first episode, welcome.

496
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
 This is what we're like.

497
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,720
 I'm Liz and I don't enjoy things.

498
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,720
 Before Liz got here today, I was doing a bit of, oh, I've read a couple of books,

499
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,720
 but now I'm reading a proper science fiction book that's obviously serious

500
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,720
 and has some things to say and is densely and interestingly written.

501
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,720
 And I'm reading it.

502
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,720
 I keep reading for 15 minutes and go, right, that's why 15 minutes I can do something else back.

503
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,720
 So it might catch far for me in a bit, but I didn't have any trouble reading Pluto Shilah.

504
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
 I just kind of went, oh, I'm in a field.

505
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
 I need a book to read.

506
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
 This will all do.

507
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,720
 I find, and this is not universally true,

508
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:15,720
 but it's certainly true that books that give me more to think about tend to be books I have to read more slowly.

509
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,720
 What are you reading now, Alison? Just out of interest.

510
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,720
 Oh, the book that I am struggling with is Goliath.

511
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,720
 Ah, okay.

512
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
 Todji on your buchi, yeah.

513
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,720
 I'm currently reading "Lone of the Ninth", which is making me think but more in a crime way than a science fiction way.

514
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,720
 I'm not thinking about the massive ideas I'm thinking about what's going on,

515
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,720
 which is a bit different.

516
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,720
 Yeah, I'm enjoying it though.

517
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:43,720
 And the book I read in the middle, which was a, which I didn't pick because it's been a previous pick

518
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,720
 and everyone knows about it already, is "City of Lost Chances" by Adrian Shikovsky, which is great.

519
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,720
 Slightly pissed off with the ending, but basically loved it.

520
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,720
 And also that's as light as I want fantasy to be.

521
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,720
 So when I went on Goodreads and discovered that the Goodreads are reusable and people going,

522
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,720
 "Oh, this is really dark and difficult." I was like, "Oh, right."

523
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,720
 That's why I don't like all the fantasy love.

524
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,720
 All you people who like really like fantasy.

525
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,720
 It's a very easy book as "City of Lost Chances" to read it straight.

526
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,720
 But I think, I don't know if I think it's very easy.

527
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,720
 I don't think it's complicated, but I think it's not complicated because Todovsky does a really good job

528
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,720
 with merging all the threads together, but there is an awful lot to keep track of in that book.

529
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,720
 Erm...

530
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,720
 Yeah, but he gives you a check, which I didn't need.

531
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,720
 It's got a dramatic persona and a map and things like that.

532
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,720
 You don't need any of that stuff. It's completely clear what's going on at all.

533
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,720
 And I'm not that careful a reader.

534
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,720
 For example, I did not notice the fridge max at better for a impletor's ride.

535
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:44,720
 Right, I'm going to do my pick in the spirit of introducing ourselves and making sure people know who we are.

536
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,720
 I'm going to pick an expansion for our Comora the Card Game.

537
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
 [laughter]

538
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,720
 On Brand.

539
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,720
 [laughter]

540
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,720
 You should probably start with an explanation of what our Comora the Card Game is.

541
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,720
 Our Comora the Card Game is a...

542
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
 erm...

543
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,720
 Tabletop card game.

544
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,720
 If you've played Magic the Gathering, you're kind out on the right lines if you start there.

545
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,720
 Instead of being random booster packs, it is boxes where you buy the box and you know what's in it,

546
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,720
 which is a big part of the appeal for me.

547
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,720
 Erm...

548
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,720
 And it is a cooperative card game that tells a story, which is the other half of the big draw for me

549
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,720
 because I like cooperative and narrative games a great deal.

550
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,720
 The way it works is you build decks.

551
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,720
 Decks represent your investigator and you investigate the mythos.

552
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,720
 And so yeah, you pile it through these scenarios.

553
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,720
 The latest expansion is called the Scarlet Keys.

554
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,720
 They used to release these expansions as a pack a month for six months.

555
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,720
 So you'd buy a box at the beginning and then you'd buy six packs and it would be eight scenarios

556
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,720
 and you would go through a linear story and then at the end you would fight the ancient one

557
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,720
 and that would be the end.

558
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,720
 The Scarlet Keys is a bit different because they've moved to a distribution model where they give you a big box

559
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
 that has a whole campaign in it all at once.

560
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:03,720
 And what that means is instead of doing it as a linear story, they give you basically a Choose Your Own Adventure book

561
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,720
 and a world map.

562
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:12,720
 And you have to go around the world visiting cities and reading out the consequent entries in the Choose Your Own Adventure book,

563
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,720
 trying to work out what's going on and if there's any way of stopping it.

564
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,720
 And this is really interesting because the first time you go through you don't know what's happening

565
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,720
 and in the same spirit as like a very open Choose Your Own Adventure book, you can get yourself in trouble

566
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,720
 and you can go to scenarios which are really quite difficult, really quite early on.

567
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,720
 But we finished the finale.

568
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,720
 We played the finale me and my wife last night.

569
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,720
 We won.

570
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,720
 We managed to stop the bad thing that was happening from happening

571
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,720
 and we got in trouble with the organisation we were supposed to be working for because every time anyone ever asked us a question,

572
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,720
 we immediately told them everything we knew every time because I am a cinnamon roll.

573
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,720
 It was really good.

574
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,720
 It really shows what the new distribution model can do and it's something they haven't done in the game before,

575
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,720
 which I think when you're at expansion number eight is quite impressive.

576
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
 John and I played an awful lot of arkamora.

577
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,720
 Well, an awful lot of arkamora for me, probably the regular amount of arkamora for John Turing, the pandemic lockdown online.

578
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,720
 But then we haven't actually played me an awful lot of arkamora for a bit.

579
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,720
 We didn't even play it in person.

580
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,720
 No, everyone got busy Liz.

581
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,720
 We played it once to you guys.

582
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,720
 I, it's sad to say it didn't quite grab me, but maybe over the board it would do better.

583
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:33,720
 Liz, you have played 92 hours of arkamora over 32 play sessions.

584
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,720
 Oh my God.

585
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:41,720
 Which is approximately one sixth of the time I have played arkamora.

586
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:48,720
 That's not bad actually. I thought you would have played like one percent of your arkamora playing, but.

587
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,720
 If it was one percent I would have played nine thousand hours of arkamora Liz.

588
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
 That would be a lot of arkamora.

589
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,720
 Yeah, no, I didn't know we played 92 hours of it.

590
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,720
 It's quite a lot of arkamora.

591
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,720
 It's four days Liz. Four glorious days.

592
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,720
 Yeah, there probably some bits where one or other of us, like we were technically playing, but someone's connection had gone down and we'd all fucked up.

593
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,720
 I've played arkamora for 22.5 days. That's quite a lot of days.

594
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,720
 Yeah, especially when you consider that's like, assuming you spend 24 hours a day on it, right?

595
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:29,720
 Oh yeah, if you think, if you're thinking in terms of like, eight hour days, then it's 67.6 days.

596
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,720
 It's like 6, 64 days of arkamora.

597
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,720
 It doesn't seem that many days really. I mean, I think, you know, if it's something you like.

598
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,720
 Liz, what's your pick? Is it playing arkamora the card game for 92 hours with John?

599
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,720
 John, that is always the pick of my heart, but I didn't do any of that in the past two weeks.

600
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,720
 So I was going to pick a book, but honestly, I haven't read that much in the past two weeks because the Tour de France is on.

601
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:56,720
 So I've just watched the Tour de France for probably 92 hours.

602
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
 Hey.

603
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,720
 And people say cycling is boring.

604
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,720
 No, it's not boring this year. It's great.

605
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:10,720
 And people say cricket is boring is what I was going to say, but because I've got a premature sinusity, it came out wrong.

606
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:19,720
 It's true, but basically it lasts for three weeks instead of having five days and a bit of break and then another five days and a break and then another five days and so on and so on forever.

607
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,720
 But also that it's not boring.

608
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,720
 I'm sure it's never boring.

609
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:29,720
 Sometimes it is boring. I admit that sometimes it's boring, but this time there are two guys who might possibly win.

610
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:35,720
 They both won before at the moment they are nine seconds apart after like two the first two weeks of the race.

611
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:42,720
 And it's really exciting, but I don't think I'm going to convert anyone on the pod, listening to the pod to Tour de France.

612
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:52,720
 But if you are interested, there is a Netflix show which is like a behind the scenes thing from last year, which you can go and watch and give you a bit of an idea of the flavour of the race.

613
00:50:52,720 --> 00:51:03,720
 And also one of the two people who might win is great and seems to spend half his time when he's not racing going around filming memes for Instagram, riding his bike one handed while eating a baguette and so on.

614
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,720
 Amazing.

615
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:11,720
 Especially as someone who enjoys cricket, which is a much maligned thing to enjoy, I am probably often a bit too rude about the cycling.

616
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:19,720
 It is in jest, but I do think like I think anything that you know enough about kind of becomes interesting the more you learn about it almost.

617
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:31,720
 Cycling does see, I can see how it is tense and I can see how it can be very tense in the same way cricket can be, especially because I think they are both sports which last long enough that you can properly get into them.

618
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:46,720
 And that is one of the things that really appeals to me about cricket and I suspect if I go into cycling, it would be one of the things that appealed to me about cycling is it tosses and turns, but there's a lot of strategy and a lot of like meta game there, which I think is great.

619
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:59,720
 Yes, there is huge amount of strategy and what are these guys doing, what is this team doing, what is their plan, do they have something up their sleeve and then when it all kind of comes together in the minute of things happening, it is great.

620
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:12,720
 The Tour de France is, it seems like incredibly long when you watched on TV, but I went to see the Tour de France when it came past my house, which was in the summer of 2014.

621
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,720
 For those who don't know, Alison lives in France.

622
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:32,720
 I do not live in France, but the Tour de France went about 200 yards from here and it goes past in about 30 seconds less and they kind of try to make it better because you'd be there all day, right?

623
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:43,720
 And so they have quite a lot of pre-show, so there are a lot of things that drive past before the Tour de France drives past and they kind of throw you samples of things and it's all a laugh.

624
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:58,720
 But the difference between the Tour de France on the telly where you can watch for a three weeks and things happen but very, very slowly, a lot of the time, and the Tour de France right by you when you go to see it where they just go, whoosh, and you go, oh, that's interesting.

625
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,720
 I'll go back and watch the end of the stage, I'll tell you there, which I did.

626
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:21,720
 This is one of the reasons why I've never been to see, and this is a foreshadowing for a future pick listeners because when I pick sport, I will probably pick Formula E, and it's one of the reasons why I have zero interest whatsoever and going to see the Formula E live, because it'd just be blurs going past periodically with the real idea of anything that was going on.

627
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:30,720
 And I think cricket is interesting because I think the experience of going to the game is very similar to the experience of going and watching it on telly, but I think racing really isn't.

628
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,720
 And that's kind of interesting how divergent the experiences can be with racing.

629
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,720
 I include motor racing, horse racing, cycling, presumably all of these things, and the experience is quite different.

630
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,720
 Maybe not horse racing.

631
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,720
 Horse racing fans, right in.

632
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,720
 Also stop here, those horses are animals.

633
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,720
 Come on.

634
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:55,720
 Apart from the Tour de France, I don't think I've ever seen any racing sport live.

635
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:02,720
 Apart from, actually I did watch a tortoise race once, which probably is in your category of things people do with animals.

636
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:14,720
 Yeah, I mean, basically the nice thing about bike racing is it's free to go and watch, so you know, everyone just goes and stands on a big hill where there'll be only lots slower and you can watch them go past for a lot longer, and has a big party basically.

637
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,720
 Yes, Wolfhamstone, not known for its big hills.

638
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:25,720
 But also to be fair, I went to watch the same Tour de France stage, you went to watch Rowan to the start in Cambridge and you presumably watched it then go to London.

639
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,720
 And it was the dullest stage I've ever watched start to finish, nothing happened.

640
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,720
 Spectacularly dull stage here.

641
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:37,720
 When kind of the biggest talking point on the stage is that someone crashed, then it's not great.

642
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,720
 And that was the "Ode to Thor" podcast, and it's goodbye from me.

643
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,720
 It's goodbye from me.

644
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,720
 It's goodbye from me.

645
00:54:43,720 --> 00:55:04,720
 [Music]

646
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,720
 I'm glad you picked Sportliz, that was good.

647
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:16,720
 Oh, I found my, I found my, I'll put it in the list, but I found my favourite, like, why I love the guy who's winning so much.

648
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,720
 Well, he's second at the moment by nine seconds, but he might win and he's done it before.

649
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,720
 It's basically, yeah, I've put the, the tweet in.

650
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,720
 Someone tweeted basically, "Oh, these are, I'm looking forward to like the race next week.

651
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,720
 These are my big picks. This is who I think might win."

652
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,720
 And some replied to him saying, you know, "Oh, Terepocca asked you to ride it."

653
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,720
 And the, the guy was like, "No, he's not riding."

654
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,720
 And then the actual rider, who, presumably taking a break from being the world's best firefighter, just popped up on Twitter to shout, "Are you sure?"

655
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,720
 And then he won it.

656
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,720
 [Laughs]

657
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:56,720
 So, he is a good shit poster. He doesn't post a lot of tweets, and presumably someone posts is like official, "Here is a photo of me riding my bike" or whatever.

658
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:05,720
 But his fiancé is also a cyclist, and when she won a race, someone referred to her as like, you know, "famous riders girlfriend."

659
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:12,720
 And he took great pleasure then in like posting lots of stuff where people were referring to him as "famous riders boyfriend."

660
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,720
 So he's definitely into the shit posting.

661
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,720
 There's a lot of that going on in the cricket at the moment.

662
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,720
 He just needs to be having a nice time at all times, even though it must be incredibly high pressure.

663
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:30,720
 But yeah, he's basically spent half his time racing and then the other bit seems to be trolling people on Instagram and Twitter, which is, uh, pleasing.
