1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Right, so shall we talk about the retro hugos?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 There are links in the show notes.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,520
 Now I confess I haven't read them.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,720
 So my plan is...

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,480
 Your plan is for me to start this one off because I've read the links, right?

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,680
 Yeah, I think so.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,960
 I think that makes sense.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,120
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 37th episode of Octa Thorpe,

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,800
 a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,160
 I'm John Coxon.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,680
 I am Alison Scott.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,960
 And I'm Liz Batty.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,240
 This episode is coming to you on the 5th of August 2021,

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:52,080
 but it was originally recorded over two sessions in August and September 2020.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,520
 Since we are not recording this episode live,

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,120
 although we have had lots of lovely letters of comment,

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,840
 we will not be getting to them this week,

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,800
 but we promise we will next week.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,120
 So feel free to lock this episode as well,

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,200
 and we will have a Schmorgas board later in the year.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,200
 Because after all listeners, it is the summer of fun!

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,880
 Hope you enjoy the episode and see you all in a fortnight.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,360
 Yeah, so we previously had some discussion of the retro hughos,

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,680
 where I think the general consensus was,

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,200
 I'm against them,

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,840
 Alison's against them, and John thinks they're kind of neat.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,960
 But there's been quite a lot of extra discussion

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,720
 from a couple of different angles that I thought was interesting actually.

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,920
 So some of it took place on file 770,

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,040
 which I read occasionally, but I don't read all the posts because there's way too many of them.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,400
 And so I became a parent that I missed quite a lot of retro hugho discussion

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,400
 before the Worldcon.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,800
 So this one, this discussion kind of hinged off the Memphis Worldcon,

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,360
 announcing that they would not run the retro hughos,

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,200
 which they announced as part of their statement on their commitment to diversity and inclusion.

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
 And there were a fair number of people noting,

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,320
 and this is something I hadn't really picked up on,

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,560
 that they were basically explicitly saying that we don't run the retro hughos

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,960
 because we think they are not favorable to our diversity and inclusion.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,520
 Which I think is reasonable given that there are people who feel that essentially that if we're

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,880
 going to have an award ceremony where we give our official Worldcon awards

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,720
 to people where we just renamed another award because we don't feel there should be anything

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,160
 named after them, it's maybe not helping our diverse inclusion.

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
 But I can see how if you're a person who feels strongly about the retro hughos,

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,920
 and who also feels strongly enough about the retro hughos that you've spent quite a lot of time

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,440
 trying to diversify the nominees, that this does feel like you're announcing way in advance

47
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,520
 that you're not going to do the retro hughos as part of this statement.

48
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,360
 And it kind of undermines what these people have been doing to try and get a more diverse

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
 set of nominees. And there's a couple of separate blog posts from

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,680
 Hampas Ekerman and Cora Boulart who have been doing quite a lot of work to try and

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:18,080
 find lists of nominees for the retro hughos each time they're held to make sure that they're

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,240
 really getting a view of the field to try and give people more things to read and more options

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,920
 beyond just naming the people that always come up because they're the names that for

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,920
 whatever reason have been passed down as common knowledge.

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,560
 I hadn't really taken on board how much work people were doing to try and diversify the nominees

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,800
 and to try and make sure there is good information out there for people to look at

57
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,640
 because it is quite difficult I think to research some of these things in the older magazines and

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,000
 go through all the science fiction of 1945. And it does seem like people have been doing a lot of

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,520
 information gathering and reading and recommendations for this that I was not really aware of. And so

60
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,520
 to have someone say no we're just not doing them we're claiming that three years in advance.

61
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,240
 Feels like they've been doing a lot that work for nothing. I think I like the retro hughos in

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,320
 concept I think that there is a definite argument and one of the arguments I've seen online is if

63
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,840
 you look at some of these states from say so basically like the first hughos were awarded in 1953 and

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:33,360
 if you look at the things that won in 1953 and then you look at what wins retro hughos around 1953

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,480
 there is an obvious difference where a lot of things that won in 1953 are things that the modern

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:46,160
 audience would have no idea existed or has not stood the test of time and would not have won if

67
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,360
 it was done as a retro hugho which is an interesting thing. And I think the thing I've thought for a

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,640
 while is it would be much more interesting if you had the retro hughos be a juried award where the

69
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:07,360
 jury was the winners of the modern hughos in that category. So you had like if you wanted to award

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,840
 the retro hughos in 2020 you had the six nominees for best novel in 2019 be the jury. That I think

71
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,400
 would be a really neat way to tie it to the modern hughos and make it clear that it's not trying to

72
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,280
 it's not trying to put ourselves in the shoes of the 1950s hugho electorate and award what would

73
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,920
 have won the hugho while taking out the impulse of the wider community just to give best editor to

74
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,480
 John W. Campbell for a year. But I will say in general old science fiction should probably read

75
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,480
 it right like new science fiction is way better like science fiction properly started in about 1995

76
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,280
 even everything before that's not really worth reading snow crashes are classic that probably is

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:59,280
 exempt. Okay so Alison is vibrating with rage. That was very wrong. That was clearly clearly a

78
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,080
 statement. You just froze on a grumpy face of Alison and it was hilarious. Sorry, Karam. Yeah.

79
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:14,480
 Old fiction generally and old science fiction in particular. Once you have got over the fact that

80
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:22,880
 you that every so often there's a an opinion or an assumption made that is hugely antithetical to

81
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,800
 the way we live now is nevertheless often of considerable merit. And you know but that's the

82
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,200
 thing about reading historical texts. It is a matter of reading historical texts. You are doing

83
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,040
 it in a different way. If you are reading purely for entertainment you are definitely going to be

84
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,360
 better served with modern stuff. But if you are actually interested in concepts and ideas and the

85
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,720
 fact that so the ways that people thought 100 years ago are not the same as the ways we think

86
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,880
 now and that doesn't just mean because they were racist and sexist and anti-inclusionary. There are

87
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,760
 lots of good things about that as well. And you could broaden your mind by visiting the past in

88
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,240
 the same way that you can broaden your mind by visiting other countries or other cultures. Anyway,

89
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
 that was not the point I was going to make about the retrohugas because I've been waiting very

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,160
 patiently to say that it doesn't. Cora Boulat has argued very cogently that they've been doing

91
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,680
 all this work, that they've been trying to show the breadth of the field that it's not just about

92
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,240
 the people we've all heard of. If you want that and as John says the last thing you would want to do

93
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:41,360
 is a popular award. Popular community awards are not good at nuance, they're not good at having

94
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,920
 everyone read everything or think hard about it. That's not what's going to happen. If you call

95
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:55,360
 it the retrohugas and have a popular vote of the Hugo of the World Club membership,

96
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,200
 you're never going to get that nuance. It's not going to happen and it doesn't matter how much

97
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,800
 work you put in to make you the nominee list interesting. People are still going to vote for

98
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,040
 name recognition and they're not going to bother to read your nominees either before they do it.

99
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,920
 Some people will but the majority of voters won't and it's all, you could have a jury

100
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,480
 award but I feel like the Hugos are ineluctably a popular award. The Hugos have been awarded to

101
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:30,560
 a load of crappy things over its time. That's kind of what the Hugo is and it's not always going to go

102
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,880
 to the best thing because it is a popular award and popular awards never do. So if you want to have

103
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,640
 an award for old science fiction though I can't think of one absolutely any reason why you would do

104
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,360
 that. Then by all means go ahead and do one but it shouldn't be called the retrohugas and it

105
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,400
 shouldn't be anything to do with the rest of the hugos or the world credits. It's just a nonsense

106
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:02,240
 I dare anyway I despair. Liz do you despair? I don't I think I'm naturally predisposed not to

107
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,640
 despair too much certainly not about retrohugas. I agree with Alison that Coribulets Brog is

108
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,440
 very cogent and actually I think you'd be interested in it John because I think it makes a good

109
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,040
 argument about why you should read older science fiction fantasy and also makes an argument that

110
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,440
 what you may have read is what has been placed in the canon maybe by people at the time or

111
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,080
 shortly afterwards and maybe what they canonized is not what is most interesting about the science

112
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,880
 fiction of that time to a modern audience. So that I found very interesting actually and there are a

113
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,080
 bunch of stories she links in there that I'm quite interested to go and read but I also agree with

114
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:53,120
 Alison that a popular vote award is probably never going to do what we wanted to in this arena and

115
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,840
 having it be not a popular vote award makes it not the retrohugas because it makes it not the

116
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:05,120
 hugos. So and I think that's the second argument here is Nicholas White the Hugo Administrator for

117
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:13,760
 Conzeland has posted some more details about the nominations for the retrohugas and what he says

118
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,840
 is there were two categories where we allowed the final ballot to proceed with one finalist who had

119
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,720
 received only three nominating votes. In cases where the final ballot would have had to include

120
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,280
 more than one eligible finalist with three or fewer nominating votes we determined the category was

121
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,200
 not sufficiently supported by voters to proceed and I think that is an incredibly low threshold

122
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,320
 to be giving awards on. What we're saying is if you've got three people to nominate something

123
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,520
 then as long as we had sufficient nominees with three or more votes and that was enough to run

124
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:50,400
 the category and I think if we are going to do retrohugas and given that they do seem to be an

125
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,680
 awful lot of time and effort and money we should definitely restrict them only to categories where

126
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,600
 there seems to be a genuine interest and I think I would have to say a genuine interest means

127
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,280
 more than three people thought someone should be on the ballot.

128
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:14,400
 I think in general that having the barrier for a that having retrohugas be awarded to things the

129
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,440
 Hugo Electric thinker worth awarding makes sense and saying that that means that more than three

130
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,840
 people had an opinion on who should be on the ballot probably also makes sense. I think those

131
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,280
 are both imminently reasonable. I don't know what the actual threshold should be. I haven't done enough

132
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:36,720
 research into the actual nominations and stuff to have a qualified opinion on that but yeah I think

133
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,600
 that does make a lot of sense. I think the problem here is that if you want like Coribulat's article

134
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:51,680
 is very interesting. Coribula in her post says that she is equally frustrated by the fact that

135
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,640
 retrohugo voters vote for familiar names like John W. Campbell and Wheat Curly Stories by Futuristars

136
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,520
 at the Drawerow River better works because she is also frustrated by that and so to combat that

137
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,280
 she started the retrohugo recommendations spreadsheet and retro science fiction reviews to help

138
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,720
 potential nominators. I think that's very laudable. I think what it ignores completely is that people

139
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,520
 it's not the the people voting for John double Campbell aren't doing it because they are like

140
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,000
 well I don't really know anyone but John W. Campbell I've heard of him I'll vote for him. I think a lot

141
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,680
 of the people voting for him are voting for him because they think he was a titan of the genre

142
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,240
 that deserves recognition and I think the problem is that if you think those people are wrong

143
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,480
 in a popular reward it's not enough to say well I'll make it clear there's a load of other options

144
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,800
 you actually have to have the arguments and so she's saying like I'm very frustrated by this and

145
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,000
 here is the action I have taken but but notable in its absence from her blog post is she has not

146
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,920
 argued with people and she has defended the retrohugos from criticism and got frustrated with people

147
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,240
 criticizing them because she's like well educate yourself and vote and it's like I don't I think

148
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,760
 this by and large misses an awful lot of the truth that in a popularly awarded award you can't do it

149
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,440
 by just saying oh people should just be more educated that doesn't work because that's not

150
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,160
 how popular rewards work if you want it to be a more educated award that that surfaces more of

151
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,360
 the genre it needs to be a jury reward and the problem with a jury reward that has the huco award

152
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,320
 name is how you make a jury reward that does have the huco award name while keeping it in the spirit

153
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,960
 of the huco awards which has always been the award awarded by the worldcom the only way I can

154
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,880
 think of doing that is to have it be reflective of the nominites or either finalists for huco awards

155
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,080
 and what they think should be recognized from the past because I think that links to the world

156
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,280
 comp fandom and the huco awards nicely and is a jury reward and so I think you could make a case

157
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,360
 that that is a good way of doing it that doesn't um occlude the tradition of the huco awards but also

158
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,160
 doesn't run into the problems that are being discussed here but I just don't really see her

159
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,880
 argument that you can make a spreadsheet of all the nominees and that will help I'm just like I

160
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:12,720
 don't think it does I'm sorry I agree with you and but I also think the jury reward juried by recent

161
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:20,640
 huco winners sounds like an amazing idea and if you decide you'd like to take that through the

162
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:27,600
 wussfuss business meeting as a suggestion I will bring popcorn I thought you were going to second

163
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,280
 to Alice and bringing popcorn is much less helpful I am not going to second it I think I think it's

164
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,240
 pointless I think they should be scrapped I think hugo administering is a lot of work already and

165
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,800
 it's twice as much work and I think it's a magnet for dissent and disagreement that that is

166
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,600
 wholly unnecessary and I think as I've said before on retro hugos I'm pretty sure the fundamental

167
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,880
 nature of the retro hugo is fatally flawed because it is actually wrong to say the hugos were not

168
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:08,560
 awarded in year x so we will put ourselves the modern world con community in the role of the

169
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:18,960
 world con community of 1943 and and make awards and I just feel that's a bad and wrong thing to do

170
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:25,040
 because we are actually denying their their personhood of their community

171
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,400
 partly because we don't like it and I had one more point which you might want might not want to

172
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,360
 edit out which is that I spend a lot of time I am all the new guys and I spend a lot of time

173
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,080
 talking to people on the internet who are a lot older than me and I think quite a few people who

174
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,240
 are voting in the retro hugos are doing so on the basis of what was very exciting when they were

175
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,920
 13 years old and were reading pulp magazines and and that is a problem that is creating some

176
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,760
 inertia of the retro hugos that is probably not get overable you know having just said oh we

177
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,040
 shouldn't put anything on the ballot which are the only three people supporting it

178
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,080
 the numbers in the regular hugos are not incredibly high and there are people and works on the ballot

179
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,080
 with nominations in the 20s but I still think that is a significant leap so I don't know where I would

180
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:20,560
 put the floor for the retro hugos but I if I was Hugo administrator which fortunately will never

181
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,440
 happen I would probably chop it off at a higher bar of this is not a category you can run I mean

182
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,600
 obviously you can't really run things like best semi-prosy and best fan cast on as you can find a lot of

183
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,360
 radio shows and things like that but I might be harsher on chopping things out I was going to say

184
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:48,480
 that on John's idea of having the Hugo finalists do this I think the question is how would you decide

185
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,760
 what material from that year the Hugo finalists have to read to do the jury award because I think

186
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,480
 if you went to many of the current Hugo nominees and said right what I want you to do now is read

187
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,040
 the entire output of like a sounding in 1945 this would not go down particularly well presumably

188
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,320
 that is a thing that has been solved for other jury awards I imagine that the people who judge the

189
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,680
 clerk don't have to read like every they don't each have to read every single book that was released

190
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,360
 in the year right because that would be more that they would have to read constantly for a year

191
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:29,440
 without sleeping and that seems unlikely most most jury awards are submission based so the publishers

192
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:37,520
 pay to submit a book to the clerk and they end up with a number of books ah okay and that's how you

193
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,400
 get around the problem at which point the jurors do indeed read them all but I think they kind of

194
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,520
 read the first couple of chapters and if it's an obvious stinker they do not carry on with it unless

195
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,720
 one of the other jurors says um this is a book that deserves your attention I understand this

196
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,320
 how it works when you've got 80 to 100 books then you just have a sort of lower threshold saying

197
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,200
 no I've read 100 pages this is a stinker I'll put it to one side unless everyone else loves it because

198
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,480
 in the end you're only going to pick six any one juror could say no I'd like everyone to read this

199
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,880
 one please one and I think and I think the other thing is obviously like there is no reason that

200
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,880
 you couldn't have this be on the basis of um if it receives a nomination it goes on the list of

201
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
 things to read um or you could have some cut off above a nomination if that ended with an

202
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,280
 implausibly high number of things to read um but presumably there are clearly people who are seeking

203
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,440
 out and nominating the stuff that is actually good versus the stuff that is famous and so there

204
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,640
 is presumably some way of of doing that so that you mean that the vetting process doesn't have to be

205
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,760
 the finalist it's only the jurying process that is um I confess I don't I just had this idea now I

206
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,840
 haven't like thought through all of the mechanics and it might be that it completely doesn't work

207
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,800
 but I do in general I think it is worthwhile despite what I said earlier about like old science

208
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,600
 fiction being not worth reading I think it is in general good to recognize like the stuff that

209
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,000
 was good of yesteryear and I don't necessarily think that the retro heroes is a bad framework

210
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,680
 in which to do that I just think that you have to decide what you want the output of that framework

211
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,680
 to be and if you want it to be a nuanced look at the forgotten gems of the genre having it be a

212
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,320
 popular awarded vote is clearly not going to achieve that goal um one other argument that

213
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,240
 Bueller makes in her blog post is that she notes a lot of the people complaining are actually angry

214
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,320
 about the um Hugo Ceremony and Martin's Toastmaster ship and they are not actually really angry about

215
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,240
 the who the retro heroes I am not sure to what extent that is true but I would be interested to see

216
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,440
 how much discussion there was on twitter about the retro heroes like in between them being awarded

217
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,720
 and Martin Toastmastering the regular Hugo's it would be it would be interesting to see whether

218
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,360
 it ramped up afterwards but I don't really know how you'd do that um but the impression I had was

219
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,840
 that people were complaining um even before Martin was Toastmaster they were but not very much

220
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,440
 they were just kind of isn't it weird that we're still um giving awards to these men

221
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,760
 whilst also stripping their names off our awards

222
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:27,840
 and I will say like I have read like I've just bought a lot of old um Lovecraft mythos fiction so

223
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:35,280
 I've bought the three volumes from the Penguin Classics collection of Lovecraft's work I've bought the

224
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:44,000
 or I've bought the Robert E Howard collection from Penguin Classics and I've bought the Clark

225
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,560
 Ashton Smith collection from Penguin Classics so like I am currently embarking on a big old

226
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:59,280
 romp through the classic Cthulhu mythos and I've read um I've read The King in Yellow by Robert

227
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,160
 Chambers which is fantastic really really really good sounds up really well um so I will say like

228
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,680
 I'd be slightly sarcastic I just I'm always suspicious of the logic that everyone should have read like

229
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,640
 all of the classics because I'm like read the classics that are interesting and don't read

230
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,040
 the ones that aren't there's no you don't have to do homework when you're reading for leisure it's

231
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:23,360
 fine yes that's right you you you can't when people say read all the classics they're essentially

232
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:33,040
 gatekeeping and sometimes they do it for the best reasons um but when you're old you go oh but I

233
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,640
 understand that because I was there and I lived through it and that is not necessarily useful to

234
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,760
 anyone who is not old it does not mean that they should have had all of the experiences you

235
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,080
 you did that you did because it is not possible for them to have had that set of experience this

236
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,080
 actually came up when I was talking to a sister-in-law yesterday um on Valentine's Day a few years ago

237
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,560
 a car of a boy year it was um Ispania and I went to see Casablanca at the local cinema because they

238
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,880
 had a Valentine's Day showing of Casablanca and I'll say two things about having odd to see Casablanca

239
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,080
 the first of which is I understand an awful lot more about cinema now that I have seen that one film

240
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,320
 because the amount that later cinema borrows from that film is quite large and the amount of

241
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,720
 cultural references made to that film is quite large and I feel like I have an awful lot more

242
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,720
 jigsaw pieces to um there are conversations where people say things I'm like oh I understand what

243
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
 that means now because I've seen the movie you're referencing which is a famous movie that people

244
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,360
 often reference and it's a bit like people would say I haven't seen Star Wars or I haven't seen

245
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,560
 Aliens and I'm like you don't have to I'm not saying you have to but I am saying is that there

246
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,640
 are things people are saying around you that you don't know what they mean because you haven't seen

247
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,320
 them which may be fine and it's not important you're not like missing you're not gonna not notice the

248
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,000
 wife's left you or that your boyfriend's proposing if you haven't seen Aliens probably I can't think

249
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,920
 of any examples where that would be true but what I will also say is Casablanca is fantastic

250
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,440
 really really really really enjoyed it we'll also say I was the only person laughing at the jokes

251
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,960
 because everyone else was there to respect a serious classic film and I was there to watch a

252
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,480
 movie on its own merit and Casablanca is a funny movie that you should laugh at the jokes in

253
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,880
 quite a funny film I've seen it seen it more than once and there were just a lot of people

254
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,360
 sitting there po-faced and I was like he just did a joke why are we not the it was weird people

255
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,760
 have this reference classics that there are classics that don't work as modern entertainment

256
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,040
 because they are too far away from from what we recognize as modern entertainment or classics that

257
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,320
 don't work as modern entertainment because they are not to your taste and you're forcing yourself

258
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,400
 to read them because you think you walked to add a some weird sense of obligation to the canon

259
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,040
 but what this also means is that people don't let themselves enjoy the classics when they're

260
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,720
 enjoyable which I find bizarre it's whatever really complicated opinion and and relationship with

261
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:58,480
 old art because I don't really I think if you're going to go and see something for me I do that

262
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,680
 because I think it might be good in modern terms and I don't tend to read the stuff but I think we

263
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,480
 crap um or more accurately I don't tend to engage with stuff I think I won't enjoy which

264
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:16,160
 probably more since but yes I I want to respond to that with two things the first is that I discovered

265
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:23,600
 that brief encounter which I had never seen was on YouTube and I thought oh you know I should

266
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,320
 watch this and I watched it about the first two minutes of it and it was so fantastically it's

267
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,840
 not the first two minutes but the first the setup probably about the first six or seven minutes

268
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,520
 and it was so fantastically good I thought right I'm gonna stop this I'm gonna watch this on my

269
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,280
 television with my daughter who will also enjoy it and and we did watch it and it's fantastic you

270
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,440
 should see it but also it's very influential and also some of the things in it are not at all quite

271
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:52,400
 what I expected them to be um and and I had obviously a lot of received information about what happens

272
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,240
 in briefing count a lot all of which is correct um because these classics have kind of permeated

273
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,960
 our world but the other thing is that I've just started to watch for the first time um one of the

274
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:14,240
 most influential works of the last 30 years which is Father Ted um and I don't know whether it's any

275
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,320
 good or not but I do know that for much of my adult life people have been quoting bits of it at me

276
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,000
 and and in fact the set of stamps um celebrated Father Ted has just been released in Ireland

277
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,880
 and I thought it might be time to watch it before it completely descends beyond the pale I observe

278
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:44,080
 the stamps while having many good quotes that I knew from the series like it's an ecumenical matter

279
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:54,640
 do not include small and far away or or um arse feck girls drink arse feck girls which I thought

280
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,720
 were very memorable quotes from the series that I've not seen I don't think I'm ever going to be

281
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,080
 able to watch it because whenever I um think about Graham Linen's art I think about Graham Linen

282
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,640
 and then I want to punch things okay so I'm not going to stop using Gil's Sans and I'm not going to

283
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,240
 stop the difference is that Gil is dead Graham Linen still has a huge following on Twitter I think

284
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,880
 when he dies I might be able to come back to it but for now it just makes me too cross the death

285
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,520
 of the author is a lot easier when the author is dead which is surprisingly coherent both in a

286
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,600
 metaphorical and a literal sense that's quite clever isn't it um I'm quite proud of that you

287
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,840
 know that's quite good um but yes so I am I'm not going to stop using Gil Sans no but I I take the

288
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,880
 point I do take the point no I mean I have I have some father Ted DVDs that I have bought in charity

289
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,560
 shops because I'm clever by um I haven't watched them I dare to it's not but I don't think you can

290
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,080
 enjoy the output of horrible people um he says having recently purchased an awful lot of HP Lovecraft

291
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,960
 fiction uh an HP Lovecraft as we all know uh problematic in the uh to say the least I think we

292
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,880
 say racist John so so readers write in that listeners write it and tell us should I wait to

293
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,640
 watch father Ted until Gravelin has his dead or should I watch it now so I can catch up with

294
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,840
 the jokes my friends have been making for 25 years in Lovecraft's defenseless he wasn't only

295
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,240
 racist he was incredibly sexist as well so he was off his time he wasn't off his time his wife left

296
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:29,280
 him because of how objectionable he was for his time he was an odious racist sexist twat even in

297
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,560
 the early 20th century and you're obsessed with his product well now I'm obsessed with with the FFT

298
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,600
 take on it which does an awful lot to reclaim the sexism and racism and make it not that um but

299
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,280
 this is a discussion that comes up in in the Arkham community every once in a while and there was

300
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,520
 always the hardcore saying oh but he was he was for the old days everyone was like that no no they

301
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,480
 weren't that's the that's the that is that is number one rule of old racism sexist but not everyone

302
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,800
 was like that and so I can't remember all you are but I don't think Raymond in his that much older

303
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:03,520
 than you are so even assuming that you have a slightly longer life expectation um as woman I would

304
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,840
 probably uh watch it now rather than watch it when you're on your deathbed

305
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,760
 do you think I should not watch it at all because of him being a dick I think it's hard

306
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,320
 to say because I watched it he's younger than me the f***er sorry I would do that again he's

307
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:29,200
 younger than me the f***er I I mean I I think it's hard to say because I watched it multiple times

308
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,280
 I think unloved it but I haven't seen it for several years and I'm not sure now if I re-watched it

309
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:43,600
 whether I would feel it had been permanently tainted by linen I guess I'd have to try and re-watch

310
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,720
 some too disarveed but mostly mostly I've been re-watching the father-tared Christmas special

311
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,840
 every Christmas for a few years because it's on 27 times every Christmas I just I just want to

312
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,880
 say like I'm not saying Alison shouldn't watch father-tared I'm saying that it makes me angry

313
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,240
 which is not a reason not it's not a reason for other people you should feel free to watch father-tared

314
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,320
 because it will not make me angry if you do it's just that I feel angry about Graham

315
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,120
 Linnehan and so I avoid things that remind me that I am angry about him which is slightly I think

316
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,640
 a slightly more nuanced take I hope you know how we were talking about the retrohuko originally

317
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:29,200
 I was going to say one benefit of kind of decoupling this effort of people to go and reevaluate the

318
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,400
 science fiction of the past and put a lot of effort into saying which ones are still worth reading

319
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,360
 and which ones may be a less worth reading um if we decouperate from the retrohuko's then there's

320
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,080
 no reason you can't just keep doing it the problem with the retrohuko's as the the hook for it is

321
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,880
 we've nearly finished doing the retrohuko's there's like three years left to go there's no reason

322
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,680
 why you couldn't say right we want to have this general effort to get people to read and reevaluate

323
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,880
 the science fiction of 50 years ago and to have it as some kind of group effort and award something

324
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,400
 if you want to but you could keep going maybe we need to introduce the retro retrohuko's where

325
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,320
 we go back to years where the hugos were rewarded and do them again properly that could be interesting

326
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,840
 as like a break off property yeah I think I said that with a straight face yes

327
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:29,760
 um yes so we were discussing um reading older works of genre in light of the retrohuko awards

328
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,280
 and one thing that has kind of become apparent is that sometimes in today's modern world one can

329
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:44,000
 end up in a situation where one needs to have a think about the extent to which the attitudes of a

330
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,080
 creator behind a piece of art one likes affects one's enjoyment of that art so we've already discussed

331
00:30:52,080 --> 00:31:00,960
 Graham Linnerhan and Father Ted in light of his recent um discussions on on twitter um and there

332
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:09,280
 are other myriad examples um so do either of you have kind of instances in which something you are

333
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:19,200
 a fan of has turned out to be the work of someone who you might not personally be a fan of oh yes good

334
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,200
 yeah I mean that was not the perfect open question oh I was very afraid you might just not say yes

335
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:32,640
 I but I will hold up my hands I should have done a battle I do actually I remember the first time

336
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:39,200
 I discovered that this was a thing because I was a great fan of a YA author called Jan Mark

337
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,360
 who wrote a number of excellent science fiction stories for um for young adults I mean that are

338
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,480
 actually quite stretchy and I was a young adult at the time I mean not a child which is what we

339
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,720
 but you know I was kind of in my early 20s and she came to one of the mexicans and turned out to be

340
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,960
 really pretty ghastly in a number of respects um I was I was quite taken aback because we didn't

341
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,560
 have the internet at the time so you you didn't know whether the people who stuff you liked were

342
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,480
 nice or not but and she wasn't kind of horrible in the kind of I have horrible views on the internet

343
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,160
 way because we don't didn't have the internet then she just was kind of not very nice in person and

344
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:34,160
 I think I hadn't really addressed this question of whether you should um divorce people's work

345
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,040
 from how they are as a person um death of the author when we talk about it normally means

346
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:49,120
 more generally the question about whether you should take the art as it stands or take into account

347
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,240
 the things that the author has said about that art um so it's not just about whether the author is

348
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,160
 somebody who you would not want to spend any time with but I mean what I took from that there's of

349
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:08,240
 course I should ignore what people are like as humans when enjoying their work and I have mostly

350
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,320
 tried to do that ever since um but actually there's some really horror people out there

351
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,560
 and feel free to not read any more Harry Potter books um I like Harry Potter even less than I like

352
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,400
 the Marvel Cinematic Universe if that's helpful so um one of the really like so so recently we were

353
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,560
 having a discussion in a in a discord somewhere we were having a discussion about um I I was

354
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:38,000
 disappointed that Retri-Hoo goes had not been awarded for 1939 because um it would have been a

355
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,240
 good chance to um give or to nominate the Enchanted Wood which is the first in the Faraway series by

356
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,960
 Enid Blightiness like it's the first book I remember reading as a kid and I I've always had

357
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,440
 enormous amount of enormous amount of affection for it and obviously Enid Blighten is like a very

358
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:05,680
 very divisive figure in terms of her frequent use of golly fucks in her stories and like her stories

359
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:12,320
 are um overtly sexist um because obviously you have George who has a short hair and is therefore

360
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,440
 a top boy and wants to be a boy and then people keep telling her she can't be as good as a boy

361
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,920
 because she's a girl and it's like you know I don't know the extent to which that reflected the

362
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,800
 thinking at the time versus the extent to which that reflected specifically Blighten's thinking

363
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,280
 um but it's certainly not a opinion anyone should hold in modern times and those books still selling

364
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,280
 and have been edited like revives to make them slightly less egregious but um but it's still

365
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,720
 potentially a problem um and certainly one of the things was but you know Blighten was famously

366
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:53,680
 sexist and racist so she probably shouldn't be awarded or or um fated by the community um and

367
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,200
 it's really interesting because I haven't really thought about Blighten's um the problematic nature

368
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,480
 of her I haven't read her books since I was a kid um and it does it does really reflect like

369
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:11,040
 yeah to me those books weren't ever about what she thought they were about like the stories in

370
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,120
 them and I really did kind of jar because obviously as an adult I read things with uh bearing in

371
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,160
 mind what the author is trying to say and and kind of like who the author is as a result um but as

372
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,320
 a kid I didn't really read like that and so yeah it was a bit of a kind of oh yeah I guess that's true

373
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,640
 um I mean I still I still think the far away tree books are amazing um but I haven't read them for

374
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,960
 20-25 years now so perhaps I am wrong good plan yeah I mean that's the thing isn't it

375
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,920
 I mean especially when you're reading like children's books as an adult I'm not sure that I would

376
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,960
 benefit from doing that um Liz how has your affection for work's been ruined by learning more about the

377
00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:01,520
 world? Hmm it's a thing you had to frame this so like you I read an awful lot of Enid Blighten as

378
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,800
 a child um and the one thing I remember that really kind of I see in a different light now is there's

379
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,720
 a set of books called um The Secret Something so they start off with The Secret Island where they

380
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,480
 run away and uh hide on an island and I remember they end up with a cow in a cave but the main thing

381
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,080
 is that there is one called The Secret Mountain um where they accidentally like crash land in a

382
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:33,920
 remote part of Africa and you know go and befriend a tribe and the way they do it I remember something

383
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,320
 like they they remember there's going to be an eclipse and so they pretend to get out of

384
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,960
 gun and shoot the sun and you know the the people there are so amazed by it and so terrified by it

385
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,200
 that they you know um let them go and you know when I read it while I was probably you know eight or

386
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,960
 nine I just read it without blinking but now of course it's a ridiculously stereotyped view of

387
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,520
 Africa as a place you know where these um you know primitive tribal people live which is completely

388
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,560
 wrong so I don't know quite where I'm going with that but like that's completely wrong then I think

389
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:15,280
 exactly I think this is when you're thinking about Death of the Ortho because obviously

390
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,920
 some of the things here are historical work that you're reading in contact and you do draw a

391
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,320
 distinction between um well I draw a distinction between um so Kipling is often criticized for

392
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:36,080
 this sort of thing but Kipling was very much reflecting that A his his depictions of both

393
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,800
 Africa and India are quite nuanced in many ways but also he was reflecting um the the

394
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,000
 moorings of his time and then other things like oh is it tintin in the Congo?

395
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,880
 Tissin in the Congo is the racist one terrible even if we're brand new you know they and and

396
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,560
 so there is a thing about when you're looking at historical things um people who are writing in

397
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:08,320
 their time will often write things that you look at now and go oh well that's that's extraordinary

398
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,680
 it's extraordinary that anyone could have had those thoughts um but when you're sort of reading

399
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,240
 as an adult you should be able to set those thoughts into context um it's really you know I've

400
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:28,320
 talked about this before I think possibly on podcast about reading um reading the Roman philosophers

401
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:36,000
 and and how at one point they'll be writing something that completely resonates with the way we think

402
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,840
 today and then in the next point they'll be um talking about the proper way to admonish your slaves

403
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:50,720
 and and it moves seamlessly from one to the other and you just have to kind of be able to say oh

404
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,840
 but that is a thing that is a thing that is a way that our thinking has changed um I always wonder

405
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:05,680
 when I'm when I'm reading people complaining about um this sort of thing whether it hasn't

406
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,800
 occurred to them that I think you might change back and historically it will change back humans

407
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:20,320
 don't aren't endlessly progressive yes no and I think I think um I don't know it's difficult like

408
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,520
 I know that I know that this is this is often used as a defense of people like oh they were you know

409
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,680
 they were a product of their time and I think that it's true you do have to bet that I'm not

410
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:37,520
 very and I but I do also think that there is a tendency to use that as an excuse not to interrogate

411
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:44,800
 the problematic aspect aspects of works sometimes and I think you've got to be careful to use that

412
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:52,800
 as a way of interpreting the text without forgiving it um if that makes sense and I think you know um

413
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,600
 I think in terms of like the three of us like where we say oh but that was like reasonable for

414
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,040
 the time we're not saying and that means it should be read uncritically now um but I know I've seen

415
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,840
 people in some internet for a being like yeah but it was fine then so just don't think about it and

416
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:15,040
 it's like no those two things are actually separate arguments which are not um there's not a not a

417
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:23,920
 good argument for each other um when I when I first read the Harry Potter books I was starting to become

418
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,320
 concerned by representations of slavery and fabcy and science fiction which is something which has

419
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,360
 continued to concern me I don't know whether I've talked about it here but whenever you're reading a

420
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:42,560
 genre book you well I feel as well as thinking of course what role do women have in this in this

421
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,560
 work which is the thing that drives me so bananas about the MCU um it's not the only thing but the

422
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:55,920
 other thing is how is the work getting done and the answer in a lot of fantasy is oh it turns out

423
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,920
 we have some slave class that does all the work and that's not good and the answer in a lot of

424
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,560
 science fiction is um it turns out that ais are doing all the work and which is a slave class and

425
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,240
 that's not good and when I first read Harry Potter which is a book which our books intended for

426
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,680
 children I I think it was about I read about the first four and then I said to a friend of mine

427
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,160
 who was very knowledgeable in the field but there is a slave class in this book there are happy

428
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:31,040
 slaves and I don't like books with happy slaves in them um and my knowledgeable friend said look

429
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,600
 how good a writer rolling is and look at the way in which she has brought these disparate elements

430
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:43,600
 this is clearly something that she has introduced to the novels in order that it will be turned around

431
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:51,040
 by the end of the arc and anyway I'm here to say in 2020 no it wasn't and no she didn't and you need

432
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,440
 to be every time there's every time there's a slave class in a book designed for children you need

433
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:05,040
 to go what is this saying what does this person mean it is not convenient to say oh we have happy

434
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,520
 slaves or women or or ais who do all the work quietly so that the important characters get

435
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,880
 on with the plot um the work has to get done and if it's not getting done there is a thing that is

436
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,680
 wrong with your books now and I do think in general like the problem that that I think that the

437
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:32,080
 problem with rolling in a lot of ways and I'm kind of ignoring for a moment the recent problems with

438
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:41,040
 Rowling is that I think for a while she wanted to be seen to be much more progressive than her works

439
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,240
 actually were stuff like saying Dumbledore was gay or saying like Hermione could be black

440
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,120
 all felt like unearned things that she had just decided oh yeah like if I just say that's true now

441
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,440
 without having done anything to substantiate it I'll get all the plaudits for being progressive

442
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,600
 without actually having to have made any progressive concessions in my work and I think what we're now

443
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:10,960
 seeing is that she is not as progressive as many people wanted her to be but I don't I was always

444
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:18,400
 highly skeptical of the fact okay so so nobody as progressive as many people would want sure but

445
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,720
 you knew what I meant so it was a fine sentence I do um the but I think what we're finding now is

446
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,640
 that or sorry I think what I'm finding now is that my skepticism about her attitudes towards

447
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,920
 social progress um and whether or not she was actually um just kind of hitching her um riding a

448
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,360
 bandwagon versus actually reflecting things she thought in her works I think I was right to be a

449
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:50,000
 bit skeptical of that because it does turn out that perhaps she's not um her works I think reflect

450
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,320
 how she thinks and I think other people interpret them and say oh this could be true she's like yeah

451
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:00,000
 why not that doesn't hurt the narrative but I think it's almost like the author trying to make

452
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,400
 the work look more progressive than it is it as opposed to sort of almost in opposition to the

453
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,600
 author's views outside the work tarnishing your view of the work if that makes sense and then

454
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,880
 obviously recently she's kind of turned out to be a bit more transphobic than one would ideally

455
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,480
 one a writer of hugely popular children novels to be I think it's progressiveness um so so there

456
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,720
 is a kind of there is an issue with people on the internet and particularly on twitter expecting

457
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:36,800
 everybody that they like to be perfect and people are not in fact perfect and rolling has many good

458
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:45,280
 points like for example um she's given a lot of money away and she's relentless in her support of

459
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:55,360
 progressive economic policy and um supporting um actual left-wing politicians and things like that

460
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:04,880
 and all of this is quite good and like many she's not that old but like many older women who

461
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,720
 um have an understanding of the history of feminism particularly in the history of feminism

462
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,840
 Britain they've got some they've got a transphobic edge and that's where that's coming from um

463
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:22,320
 who knows if she'll come to her senses I suspect probably won't but there we go um but

464
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,560
 I think it's quite odd to say oh people have to be perfected everything before we'll um

465
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,920
 before we'll say we still like their stuff I think my main feeling is that there is kind of more

466
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:45,280
 stuff out there for me to watch and read and engage with than I will ever get to and I think it is

467
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,680
 perfectly legitimate if people want to say actually I don't want to read this person's books I think

468
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:57,680
 this person has views I find a warrant and that is basically fine with me I think we all get to

469
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,320
 choose what what we engage with and if that's your reason for not engaging with it then I'm

470
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,600
 completely fine with it if you decide that you don't want to read Harry Potter books or you

471
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:11,920
 never want to read the cormor and strike books because of things JK Rowling has said then that's

472
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,480
 okay with me I do find it difficult when people who make works I really like later on turn out to

473
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,760
 have been in some way just terrible people um I think the latest example of this was uh Shane

474
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:33,600
 Karuth who has you know made primer a film I like very much um but then then basically sort of leaked

475
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,880
 kind of leaked in a and a tweet with a picture of an album in he left a piece of paper in there

476
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,920
 what must be deliberately leaking the fact that his um ex-girlfriend had a restraining order against

477
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,800
 him as her new film was coming out um which is just a really icky thing to do and kind of makes

478
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,000
 you think a lot less of him and it makes me I think now less interested in what works he will make

479
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,160
 next but I'm not sure it makes me less I'm not sure it makes me like the film he's already made less

480
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,240
 no that's I think that's fair because I think and I think this is like a thing I think we need to get

481
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:17,040
 I think something that it will be healthy if we can arrive at is a way of forgiving ourselves for

482
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:23,600
 liking things that are problematic in a way that doesn't mean we no let me I am worried that

483
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,560
 sometimes we alienate people who like things by saying you're not allowed to like that thing

484
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,560
 because the person who did it is an idiot and they're like but I like the things or I'm going to ignore

485
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:42,400
 you and I do think that it will be good um people do I think there is a benefit to be able to say

486
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,840
 I appreciate you like this thing and I'm not judging you for like this thing but I do think

487
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,720
 you should think about the fact that the person who did it is a cockwombal and um you know you might

488
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,720
 want to um you might want to think about like what it means to actually support them and stuff

489
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,880
 without saying but that while still saying but that doesn't mean you can't like the thing you

490
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,320
 like because I think if someone says you can't like that thing and you like the thing your initial

491
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,240
 reaction is we'll go away whereas if you say you could like that figure that's fine but like

492
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,000
 there's this other thing that maybe you should consider perhaps that's like a good way of getting

493
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,800
 people into thinking about these issues in a way that's less confrontational so perhaps that's

494
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:26,720
 actually like a healthy thing but I'm also um open to the um kind of counter-suggestion that if you say

495
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,960
 well if I had to like things that are made by problematic people then that does open the door

496
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,240
 to continuing to financially support those problematic people in a way that may not actually help

497
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,360
 social progress in any meaningful way so it is a it's a really really really difficult tightrope I

498
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,440
 think um and it's really really hard and so I do sympathize with you Liz because like there are

499
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,160
 people who are problematic who made stuff I like as we've discussed um I love I love the book end

500
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:56,320
 as game I do not love the author of the book end as game um there are things in end as game that

501
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,480
 I realized were problematic after I learned more about the author of the book end as game but like

502
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,640
 that's that's true of all of card's writing that I really really liked a lot of his early short stories

503
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:16,880
 and some of his early novels and I again I benefited hugely from then not being an internet at the time

504
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,880
 because I had read a lot of card before I realized how generally odd he was as a person and then

505
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:32,240
 once you know that it is actually hard to reread this stuff without bearing that in mind he is

506
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,640
 someone whose worldview colors his work to a degree that's I mean I can't believe I didn't

507
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,520
 notice it in the first place to be honest but there you go I wasn't a very subtle reader

508
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,600
 I'm probably still not that's fair no I didn't I didn't notice there are things where people

509
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,040
 are like but how do you not notice this and I'm like well now you've said out loud and linked it

510
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,600
 like that I see that it's a problem but at the time I was just like oh this has lasers in that

511
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:03,600
 was the secret episode out of time of Oct thought the podcast but for now it is goodbye from me

512
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:11,520
 it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

513
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,080
 I think that probably wraps it up right we appear to be recording for an hour and 51 minutes

514
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:32,480
 and there's cricket on later so I got to start getting my uh got to start getting my cricket

515
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,920
 cricket mood I was quite amazed by how much I enjoyed the cricket when I watched it I happened

516
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,480
 to be in a house where the cricket was on I kind of enjoy watching it I enjoy watching it when it's

517
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,880
 on and I think you're kind of like it's on and you're part of out doing other stuff and maybe

518
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,480
 you chat to people as well and then there'll be like a flurry of excitement and then you go back

519
00:50:52,480 --> 00:51:00,080
 to other things the fourth day of the first test against Pakistan against Pakistan it was

520
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,760
 absolutely riveting throughout from the beginning to the end there was no there wasn't really any

521
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,160
 time apart from lunch and tea when you might have done something else because it was it was

522
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:18,480
 extraordinarily good you know this was my realization in the two 2005 ashes I saw I was vaguely aware

523
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,240
 of cricket and I thought it might be something I could be a fan of but I hadn't really thought

524
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,960
 much about it and then I watched and then I I decided I was going to put the cricket on at 11

525
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:33,520
 and just watch until I got bored and at 6 p.m I got up and thought oh I should probably eat something

526
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:42,480
 and I think for me there is something about that asymmetry of the game and the way that the strategy

527
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,120
 unfolds over such a long time that just makes it riveting in a way that other sports don't do for me

528
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,840
 I think it might be the same reason I really like board games because I liked Netrunner and that was

529
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,160
 an asymmetrical board game and I liked it a whole lot and I do wonder whether cricket scratches a lot

530
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:05,120
 of those same itches but in with sexy men uh so yeah not that quins from shut up sit down isn't a

531
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:11,440
 sexy man because um I'm at Lee's whoa sorry what's that got to do with I'm just daydreaming about sexy

532
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,480
 men now Alison oh well that seems perfectly reasonable I'm I was watching Black Panther

533
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:23,840
 speaking of sexy men and I was like why why are they doing this ritual combat by the edge of a

534
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:32,560
 waterfall and Marianne was like because it makes them wet mum yeah I'm gonna go and watch the

535
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:39,600
 bicycle racing which is good if you like men with a very particular body shape and extremely bad

536
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:47,040
 tan lines I don't like I find because Australia Ozzy Rules football the men were really lovely

537
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:53,040
 and I think it's because it's a very good whole body workout cycling they're not quite my type

538
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,280
 but I do like cycling is another thing that that some people think is boring and I'd watch kind of

539
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,000
 highlights of cycling and found it boring but then if I go and watch the Tour de France I find it

540
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,360
 it's completely fine so I can watch it for hours and hours and hours and hours that is indeed what

541
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,000
 I'm going to do this evening while John watches the Gricket the theme music for this episode was
