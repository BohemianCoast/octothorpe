1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 But as if this is your first episode, I recommend going and listening to a different one first,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,480
 because this one is mad.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:19,160
 One, two, three.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:28,160
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 38th episode of Octa Thought, a podcast for science fiction

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,440
 and science fiction fandom. I'm Jon Coxon.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,480
 I'm Alison Scott.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,520
 And I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,120
 This episode is coming to you on the 19th of August 2021, and we are live and in person and next to

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520
 each other sitting around a table.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,040
 Big hug!

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,400
 Yeah!

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,200
 No actual hugging, because we haven't got that face yet.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,240
 But also, yeah, like, you know.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,680
 Yeah, I'm not sure about this.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,360
 Yeah, you slide those.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,120
 But we are at the same place. It is amazing.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,240
 It is good.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,360
 It's very nice.

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,160
 It's very nice.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
 We went to a brewery, yes, Tain drank beer that people brought to us.

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,160
 Yeah, we sat in a bar with lots of people in a bar.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,560
 It was good.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,880
 Well, sit for us in a bar and then as soon as we finished recording this podcast,

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,480
 we're going to go back to the same brewery where our friends already are,

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,520
 and we're going to drink more beer in the same brewery, which is why

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,120
 today's episode is going to be very, very short.

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,680
 Every minute.

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,320
 Okay, thank you.

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,120
 That's just not too full of 30 minutes.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,800
 I'm being else's daughter.

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,840
 So we have to apologise also.

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,200
 The sound quality will be rubbish.

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
 We will interrupt each other a lot and it is very short.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,480
 But that is because we are recording lower eve before going to a brewery.

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,120
 We have one studio mic in the middle of the room set to omni.

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,520
 It is true.

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,920
 It means that John and I are going to be even louder than usual,

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
 and Liz is going to be even quieter than usual despite the fact

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,960
 that we have put the right narrow list and don't make it.

40
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,840
 Hee hee hee.

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,360
 We will lean in and then my chair creaks.

42
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,240
 So I won't do that.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,960
 No, it's good.

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,600
 Chair creaking is all part of how all the sausage is made.

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,080
 I don't know if people remember the chair creaking from early octa-thorps,

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
 but maybe people miss it maybe then he'll stop jig for the sign of my chair going.

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,720
 So there is a concert warning for this episode,

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
 which is that we are likely to be vague and unfocused,

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,240
 even more so than usual.

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,880
 Yes, we would like to have a photo for the last episode.

51
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,800
 We should have put a content warning in for discussion of entrenched social injustice,

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,440
 and also I should have used the word "golly" instead of the word I actually used when discussing

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
 "eaninged light inspection", which I am truly sorry and has been bleeped now

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,560
 after a listener suggested so doing.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,360
 I mean the listener was Liz, but Liz did listen, so it counts.

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,440
 Didn't we get a lot from disgusted of Tumbridge Wells?

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,120
 No, I consulted a crew of people.

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,080
 I think of them in my head as the woke squad, which is whenever I need to know whether

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,280
 I've done something wrong, I contact a certain group of people and say, "Hello,

60
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,280
 I have a question about why I should have done in this situation and they tell me."

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,760
 And so...

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,680
 So I use my children for that function.

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,440
 Whenever I think, "Is this something that is going to be adequate for today's social

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,320
 lorries?" I ask my daughter and she says, "No."

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,680
 Or sometimes, "No, mum."

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,360
 Or sometimes, "Mum, why are you even asking?"

67
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,600
 "John, you're really loud. I haven't seen you for like two years or something.

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,360
 I don't think I realized how loud you can be."

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,200
 Zoom, Zoom automatically modulates my life to normal human levels, but in person my

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
 laugh is too loud.

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,160
 It is ear splitting.

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,200
 It's amazing.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,560
 Yeah, so this is actually bleeding slightly from Ollieur at the moment.

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,960
 People have on multiple previous occasions found where I live by going to the street and

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,360
 listening for my laugh and just knocking on that door.

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,520
 Like in three different places, different people have employed that method for finding my house.

77
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,040
 So I know my laugh is loud.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,960
 And if I go to Radio 4 recordings, I can hear myself on the recording in the laugh.

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,840
 That's like when live music is recorded at festivals or folk clubs that I'm at,

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,240
 I can often hear my voice in the edit when they're singing on to the chorus.

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,280
 I'm like, "Oh, that is Nature's Way of Telling You. You are singing too loudly on choruses.

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,080
 You should stop COVID-19 was also Nature's Way of Telling Me. I sang too loudly on choruses."

83
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
 No, you should sing along to chorus very loudly.

84
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
 That's what the chorus is for.

85
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,480
 I mean, not right now, obviously.

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,280
 It doesn't take a lot.

87
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,680
 But anyway, yeah, me and Alison are loud.

88
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
 Who knew?

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,840
 I did.

90
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,000
 Yes, that is very funny.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,920
 Are we now doing a person online?

92
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,440
 Yeah.

93
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,640
 Well, online I can pull my headphones away from my ears.

94
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,560
 And it works and that doesn't work.

95
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
 Well, you can wear headphones while we record.

96
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,640
 I could wear earplugs, George.

97
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,080
 None of us are wearing headphones today.

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,480
 We just all have naked ears.

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,360
 Yes, we do have naked ears.

100
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,880
 But oh yeah, we're in person.

101
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,360
 It's weird.

102
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
 We went to a brewery called Double Barreled.

103
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,720
 So thank you to them.

104
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,640
 And thank you very much to Steve and Julia for hosting this punctuation

105
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,880
 committee meeting and also making very good food and bringing beers and coffee and

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,040
 just generally being fantastic hosts.

107
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,160
 Yes, generally this podcast is fueled by Double Barrel Brewery and also Steve and Julie.

108
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,640
 And his family.

109
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,440
 Happy tears.

110
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,200
 Julie is tartafled.

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,160
 Tartafled.

112
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,280
 That's so good.

113
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,000
 I understand you're going to the brewery this afternoon.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,600
 So I thought we might have a dish made from bacon and potatoes and cheese and cream for lunch.

115
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,120
 I mean, I've got to say this morning I watched Johnny to full English breakfast

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,600
 followed by a hash brown sandwich.

117
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,360
 Followed by three pano chocolat which will be in the in the chapter art listeners of this

118
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,080
 chapter.

119
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,200
 They're only mini.

120
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,320
 They're only mini.

121
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,440
 I think but I did.

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
 I got two slices of toast and I had two hash browns.

123
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
 I had some mushrooms and I met myself for toast sandwich.

124
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,080
 It was very nice.

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,880
 I have no regrets.

126
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
 I recommend it to anyone who likes hash browns and toast.

127
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,560
 Well, we'll like we'll be having anything to talk about because we've got no topic.

128
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
 And all we're going to do is talk about what we're doing this weekend,

129
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
 which is being in person with all the people.

130
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,440
 Yes.

131
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
 You have no idea.

132
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
 It is so much fun.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,280
 People, although we were inside in the bar, the bar is very large.

134
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,760
 It's like an industrial unit.

135
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,120
 I mean, it is an industrial unit.

136
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,680
 It's a brewery.

137
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,240
 Yeah.

138
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,800
 This is using the like in the modern down with the young people way where I mean is.

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,720
 I'm using like to mean the brewery is like a large industrial unit.

140
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,600
 Sorry, I didn't assume you were using like in the modern young person way.

141
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
 I should be using it in the like regular old person.

142
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,120
 Regular actually English English uses for a year.

143
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,840
 Well, you know, I do.

144
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:02,160
 So the brewery is an industrial unit with benches and beer and the other thing about

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,920
 seeing John in person, which I haven't done since we started doing octa-thorb.

146
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,440
 And I feel like I didn't know John as well.

147
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,000
 No, yeah.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,360
 And I had not realized that he just he interjects the most appalling

149
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
 thumbs into conversation.

150
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,760
 Yeah, yeah, do.

151
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,440
 In the manner of somebody who hasn't been trained out of it by the mates yet.

152
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,720
 Well, my wife finds it funny.

153
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,760
 She encourages me.

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,040
 So I've been all on her.

155
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,680
 Love you, honey.

156
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,240
 Yeah.

157
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,080
 So, um, yes, we are in person and this episode, we're not going to do letters of comment.

158
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,800
 Gonna say we're going to say all the letters of comment on both episode

159
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,480
 did 7 and 36 for a bumper podcast next time.

160
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,240
 I was going to talk about the brewery and say it was, although we were in person

161
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,280
 and with all of us on a table, it's huge and has high ceilings and is very well ventilated and lofty.

162
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,560
 And so it felt very comfortable.

163
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,120
 And in terms of Stephen Julia's house, we all did lateral flow tests and we have all been

164
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,600
 at least double vaccinated and we are being super careful in the house.

165
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,960
 So, you know, and hey, you know, we've been petting cats because there's cats and they are

166
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,520
 less scared than they were last time we were here.

167
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,440
 So one of them is still pretty scared and one of them is scared, but we'll do things for food

168
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,200
 and the other one is scared, but we'll, if you start playing with them, they go,

169
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,400
 "Oh, this is a scary monster who dang was a cat toy."

170
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,760
 No, it's good. It is very good.

171
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,840
 So we're being in person is fun.

172
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,280
 I feel like being in the same place as other people and having fun together is fun.

173
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,880
 It is. You are not wrong.

174
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,880
 It is. I mean, I still feel, personally, I still feel slightly cautious about it

175
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,600
 whenever I end up in a group largely than about four.

176
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,160
 Yeah. So this is a group of nine, which is my biggest group yet indoors, definitely.

177
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,720
 Yes.

178
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,160
 I mean, it's not mine. And also I did, I mean, it's been not as long for me.

179
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,760
 I mean, I went to a New Year's Eve party where there were like 20, 30 people,

180
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,480
 because that was all perfectly fine. And within, you know, the restrictions at the time.

181
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,640
 So it's not been quite as long, but I am feeling slightly cautious even with vaccinations.

182
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,600
 That's fair.

183
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,440
 So, but it's, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see where we go from here.

184
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,480
 Because the next day...

185
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,040
 The brewery.

186
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,360
 Well, where we go from here is going to be back to the brewery.

187
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,920
 Yeah, it's not beer.

188
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,040
 Where we'll go to drink beer.

189
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,080
 And oh, the other thing I was going to say about the brewery is that

190
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,840
 since the last time I went and hung out in a pub with my mates over the afternoon,

191
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,000
 they've introduced a process where by you sit at a table and you just order the beer

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,120
 that you want on your phone and they bring it to you.

193
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
 And that means that you can order the beer that you want and pay for it.

194
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,480
 And there are no rounds. There's just a kind of beer drinking system.

195
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,720
 Yeah.

196
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,280
 Yeah.

197
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,920
 It's good.

198
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,400
 They unfortunately email you...

199
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,200
 Twice.

200
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,880
 A list of exactly what beer you bought, which when you're looking at it afterwards,

201
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,120
 I think I prefer the pre-COVID methodism of waking up in the morning.

202
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,520
 What we used to call it a visit from the gorilla.

203
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,920
 Are you familiar with this?

204
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,160
 No.

205
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,120
 Don't do so.

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,520
 Okay.

207
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,920
 But Steve, you've just tagged us on Untacked.

208
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,080
 Yeah.

209
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,040
 He's just...

210
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,680
 You wake up feeling that you've had a visit from the gorilla by means that something,

211
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,840
 something very large and unfriendly, has beaten you around the head,

212
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,000
 rifle your wallet and peed in your mouth.

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,560
 I mean, that's...

214
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,880
 Yeah, that is not inaccurate.

215
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,120
 So now you get a set of emails going,

216
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
 "I am your friendly gorilla and here are the seven beers you bought yesterday after the evening."

217
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,000
 Yeah.

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
 We should pay for them.

219
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
 We should discuss the summer of fun.

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,880
 Oh, yeah.

221
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
 This is actually this weekend is my summer of fun.

222
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,080
 So listeners, astute listeners will have noticed that this episode and the preceding two episodes

223
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,960
 had a different theme song to our usual.

224
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,120
 And that is because it being summer,

225
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
 we're all busier than we would usually be.

226
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
 It's a preceding episode.

227
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,600
 The one...

228
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,280
 I mean, I know episode X had a different one,

229
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,120
 but the one before that I have a different one as well.

230
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,880
 I went back and edited it retrospectively to Gaslight Alice-norship,

231
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,000
 but don't tell them.

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,680
 Uh, sorry.

233
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,760
 John went back retrospectively and edited it to Gaslight Alice-n.

234
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
 Well, I know, because I told you straight away as soon as you watched,

235
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,240
 is that Gaslight-n?

236
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,440
 It's very...

237
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,840
 It's more sort of like candle-lying.

238
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,760
 Anyway, John is very taken with this idea of the summer of...

239
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,560
 Summer of fun?

240
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,440
 No, we have to have sort of surf guitar instead of our regular.

241
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,640
 Yeah, I think it's quite nice.

242
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,840
 I like surf guitar a lot.

243
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,080
 I mean, John knew when he sent me the cheesy surf guitar music,

244
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,600
 he knew that it was right up like...

245
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,400
 Yes.

246
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,040
 Ali, because we've been talking about nerd surf guitar tunes.

247
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,600
 So we will.

248
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,240
 In chat.

249
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,680
 We're going to discuss one lock,

250
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
 because we did get one lock on the last episode,

251
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,040
 which we recorded about a year ago, saying it was our best episode yet.

252
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,560
 And as Liz pointed out, that means we peaked in September 2020.

253
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,400
 So we're very happy about that, obviously.

254
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,240
 We know that it's all downhill from here.

255
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,120
 But last episode was an episode we recorded ages ago,

256
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,600
 and the episode before that was a episode we recorded,

257
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
 like as soon as dropping the previous episode.

258
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,480
 And so this has all been kind of very around our schedules in a way that

259
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
 normal lock-stalk is not.

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
 But next episode,

261
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,520
 we will discuss lots of letters of comment,

262
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,480
 and we promise we will cover the important

263
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,680
 vanished topics of the day,

264
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,320
 which there are definitely going to be by then.

265
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,240
 This time, I think I want to talk about how doing things in person with people is fun,

266
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,720
 and so maybe we'll be going to in person,

267
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,800
 Corflu, and so it will come on.

268
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,720
 Liz, are you going to go to Corflu and overcome?

269
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,280
 No.

270
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,760
 Cool.

271
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,360
 By the time we record the next episode,

272
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
 I'll probably be back in quarantine again.

273
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,400
 In July?

274
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,320
 Yes, I'll probably be back in quarantine again,

275
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,280
 and you know, things as they are,

276
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,880
 the idea of quarantining on both ends of a trip is currently not fun,

277
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,920
 so no, there's basically no chance I will come to Corflu and overcome.

278
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,400
 Yeah.

279
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,160
 I will definitely be going to know the quarantine.

280
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,640
 You said this in the previous thing,

281
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
 but you said that quarantining is no fun,

282
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,840
 but then we were like,

283
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,880
 we're really sorry for Liz who is stuck in quarantine,

284
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
 and you sent us a photo of the most beautiful garden,

285
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,520
 so you know.

286
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,960
 Yes, it was a beautiful garden,

287
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,040
 and that was all I was allowed to do for today.

288
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,120
 Yeah.

289
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,680
 So,

290
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,080
 Yeah.

291
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,880
 Hades?

292
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,520
 Not yet.

293
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:03,680
 Yeah.

294
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,560
 Don't have a PlayStation 4 with me in quarantine.

295
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
 Oh.

296
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,720
 That could probably be the right to read,

297
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
 if we thought about it early enough, actually.

298
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,160
 Shall I have a Liz squad who just came and gave you like entertainment?

299
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,440
 So, it re-naded you.

300
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,800
 It was fine, but basically,

301
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
 it means all trips have to be long trips,

302
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,640
 and it is still, you know,

303
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,160
 it is still a lot more complicated than it used to be and involves.

304
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,400
 It is lovely to see you and so on,

305
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,440
 so I'm happy to see you.

306
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,560
 Lovely to see you.

307
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,120
 Yes.

308
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
 Very glad I have done it, but I will not.

309
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,840
 It is not something you can just leap on a plane and do,

310
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,560
 and still.

311
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,040
 Yeah.

312
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,840
 So, for those who really don't pay attention,

313
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,440
 or for whom this is your first episode,

314
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,480
 Liz is in the UK, and usually Liz is in Thailand,

315
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,640
 so this is very exciting, and it's been very good to see you.

316
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,520
 But how you set that?

317
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,840
 If you think this is exciting,

318
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,040
 wait till the issue when all three of us are in Thailand.

319
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,320
 Because John and I are going to be bouncing off walls at one point.

320
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,440
 That will be good.

321
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,480
 Well, it will be very hot,

322
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
 so I might not be bouncing off walls.

323
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,760
 It is very hot all year round,

324
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,880
 or is there a time that we can kind of be on the beach in Thailand,

325
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,240
 and it is not so very hot?

326
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,760
 What you consider to be...

327
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,960
 Above 19 hot.

328
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,600
 On a beach.

329
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,520
 Yeah, but what temperature do you consider to be very hot is a question.

330
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,320
 If I'm on a beach, I'm really comfortable at 90.

331
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,000
 What's 90?

332
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,720
 I don't know what that is.

333
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,080
 Hey Siri, what's 90 degrees Fahrenheit in sensory grade?

334
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,760
 The 90 degrees Fahrenheit is 32.2 degrees Celsius.

335
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,560
 That's far too high.

336
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,000
 Oh yeah, if you like 32 degrees,

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,720
 then you can get that probably 9 months of the year.

338
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,520
 So, but if I'm,

339
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,400
 of course I don't tell I could get a hotel with air conditioning.

340
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,480
 Yes.

341
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,840
 So I get a hotel with air conditioning.

342
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,400
 Air conditioning.

343
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:38,800
 At the beach.

344
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,440
 Yeah, that's fair.

345
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,000
 Yes.

346
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,960
 I'm fine with weather in the mid 80s, sorry.

347
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,320
 Up to about 30 or so.

348
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,640
 I'm British.

349
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,160
 The normal British way to do weather is cold temperatures in Celsius is fine.

350
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,760
 So if it's down about like two degrees or three degrees,

351
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,040
 you do it in Celsius.

352
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,280
 So if it's hot, you do it in Fahrenheit.

353
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,880
 I think this might be a generational.

354
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,320
 It is very much a generation.

355
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
 In the middle of the scale somewhere.

356
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,560
 No.

357
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,640
 Anyway, we may have digressed.

358
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,160
 Okay, you can.

359
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,280
 You can.

360
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,320
 You're going to get letters from readers because there are other readers.

361
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,560
 No, you can swap.

362
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,840
 You may not.

363
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,680
 I withdraw any implied permission for you to do so listeners.

364
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,880
 And if you have been doing,

365
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
 I demand you cease now.

366
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,960
 Okay, because John is the arbiter of what we do.

367
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,480
 That has never been true, even a octa-thole.

368
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
 Yeah, in this case, I agree with John.

369
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,040
 Okay, so on octa-thole, apparently we use the Celsius.

370
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,760
 Yes.

371
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,880
 That's so useful.

372
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,760
 That's actually almost like hugging.

373
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,400
 Kelvin would also be acceptable.

374
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,280
 I could do Kelvin.

375
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,880
 I can't do Kelvin for ordinary UK weather or even Thai weather.

376
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
 It's pretty complicated.

377
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,840
 About 200 and something usually.

378
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,840
 No, I think we're kind of like 300 and...

379
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,040
 No, true.

380
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,520
 Thailand.

381
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,000
 Thailand.

382
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,680
 We'll be 300 and something, right?

383
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,520
 If you could plot the distribution of temperatures in Kelvin in Thailand at different times of year,

384
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,440
 and just send it to us for the chapter, I'll be great.

385
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,480
 You probably want to get me to do that.

386
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,360
 Am I doing crayon?

387
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
 Yes.

388
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,240
 Yes, please do that.

389
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,720
 It's crayon.

390
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,200
 It's crayon.

391
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,640
 Program or do you actually mean crayon?

392
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,600
 No, I mean with a crayon.

393
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
 If you draw a barf chart of temperatures in crayon,

394
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,960
 I will put it in the crayon.

395
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,560
 It's going to be mostly a straight line.

396
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,200
 That's fine.

397
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,840
 Every minute we spend digressing is a minute

398
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,600
 we are not digressing in the pub.

399
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,160
 That's true.

400
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
 I'm sure it's the podcast, isn't it?

401
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,480
 I'm sure.

402
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,280
 This is too far.

403
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,400
 John, this is too far.

404
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,160
 So one of the things we have been discussing on this weekend of punctuation

405
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,400
 committee meetings is the prospect of future punctuation.

406
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,320
 There may be more punctuation.

407
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,880
 Yeah, we're thinking about whether we want to do another punctuation.

408
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,680
 We're thinking about whether we want to do another virtual punctuation at a time of year,

409
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
 when although we could theoretically get together and meet people,

410
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,880
 nobody's going to want to.

411
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,880
 And all we could do a punctuation in person sometime.

412
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,320
 And all of these things are possibilities and punctuation too.

413
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,040
 Okay, so I need to do a little bit of explanation for punctuation too,

414
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,680
 which is because we made too much money for punctuation one.

415
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,000
 For punctuation two, we explicitly said that people could pay zero pounds or five pounds or 10 pounds

416
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
 depending on what they wanted to spend.

417
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,760
 In fact, lots of people gave us 10 pounds, so if we make more money and that is paid for our weekend.

418
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,520
 But you know, I don't know.

419
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,080
 No, it's paid for the grocery.

420
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,760
 It's not like we haven't gotten like caviar and cigar.

421
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,920
 So we have got the convention to pay for the groceries for our post convention committee meeting,

422
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,640
 which is the day.

423
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,200
 And by groceries, I do not include the beer of which there was very large options.

424
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,960
 Yes, rest assured listeners, none of your money has gone on beer.

425
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,240
 Yes, we have not been spending your punctuation funds on double barreled.

426
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,680
 No.

427
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,120
 No, double barreled is quite good.

428
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,480
 Yeah.

429
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,880
 Because that's like got a hyphen in the middle and that's punctuation.

430
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
 No, it could be.

431
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,920
 And doesn't they have a hyphen in the name?

432
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,120
 Oh, damn.

433
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,760
 What was that?

434
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
 I don't think they have a hyphen in their name.

435
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,640
 Really?

436
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,960
 I think they're just double barreled.

437
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,360
 Too much.

438
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,960
 The Spaniards just sent me a picture of some beer.

439
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,080
 Oh, no, they do have one in there.

440
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,400
 Yeah, it's interesting.

441
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,960
 Hey, it's got a very good logo.

442
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
 Yeah, everything about double barreled is lovely.

443
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,920
 We are considering an in-person punctuation or as I think we should call it, in-per-ulturation.

444
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,880
 Yeah, okay.

445
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
 Listen, I like that one, so I can't get away with it.

446
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,840
 I'm going to have to cut that one out.

447
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,880
 Yeah, no, that don't think that was very good.

448
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,640
 I think we're considering it but I don't think we are anywhere near.

449
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
 Oh, we have no plan right now.

450
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,080
 No, other than...

451
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,880
 It's a future possibility.

452
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,360
 So, what are we all doing on our summer of fun?

453
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:50,240
 Because I have... I got another video game into the Hugo packet, so if you are a Hugo member

454
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,920
 and you haven't yet hit us up for free copies of Hades, Spiritfarer, and Final Fantasy 7 Remake,

455
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,440
 please do so.

456
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,240
 The instructions are in your Hugo packet and if you haven't downloaded the new version of the

457
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,200
 Hugo packet, you should do so and get the stuff there.

458
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
 They're quite good.

459
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,880
 Because they're all very good games and I would...

460
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,560
 Yeah, so now you can play four of the six games for Nothing

461
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,560
 and the other two are The Last of Us Part 2 and Animal Crossing.

462
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,440
 Animal Crossing is quite a bit more than Nothing, certainly, because that's how Nintendo do.

463
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
 I think both of those are quite a bit more than Nothing.

464
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,840
 Yeah, they are quite...

465
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,960
 They're both lots of games.

466
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,480
 I was kind of looking and getting them second-hand but even then they're quite expensive.

467
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,880
 Yeah, but then if you buy a second-hand physical copy, you can then take it back to your video game shop and get money.

468
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,440
 I have sold Alice in a PlayStation 2, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 4.

469
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,720
 I wrote on a tray.

470
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,560
 But she's going to go to a PlayStation 4 and I'll play Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

471
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,520
 That's the important thing.

472
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,200
 You're going to be able to play this Hugo award finalist-ed game.

473
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,840
 Yeah, using John's old PlayStation 4 and I have some other games to play and so you won't be hearing

474
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,000
 much from me because I'm going to be playing games with the next couple of months.

475
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,880
 That's my plan for the next two weeks.

476
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
 So your plan for the summer fun is...

477
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,480
 So in games we're going to see Hampshire tourist attractions that we haven't seen yet.

478
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,440
 And cricket.

479
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
 And cricket to go and see the Southern Brave play Welsh Fire.

480
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,320
 So what are you doing the summerless?

481
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,240
 Well, I've come to the UK and I've been on holiday and now I'm doing some work and then I'm going to go back to Thailand.

482
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,800
 So yeah, my summer is over.

483
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,640
 Weirdo.

484
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,080
 This is the beginning of my summer-

485
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,000
 And your summer is really interesting because most people's summer are hot and sunny.

486
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
 And Liz.

487
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,640
 And Liz is basically deciding to have a cold wet summer as an interjection in the middle of a hot sunny lifestyle.

488
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
 Yes, I'm wearing a jumper right now.

489
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
 Yes, but also shorts.

490
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,520
 Yeah, that was a tactical error.

491
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,640
 My summer of fun is just starting because this

492
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,640
 Yesterday marked two weeks since my second jab of the Fonzer vaccine.

493
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,200
 So I am now immortal and I can go to places, obviously wearing a mask and

494
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,440
 compulsively sanitize my hands and try to say outside where possible,

495
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,160
 except for the hotel breakfast this morning, which was less socially distanced than

496
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,400
 all of the things I've done in the previous 18 months put together.

497
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,440
 How long have we recorded in Freshland Check?

498
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,000
 Some.

499
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,440
 Oh, yeah, about 30 minutes.

500
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,200
 Yeah, so it's very much that lovely.

501
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,680
 That was a lot of fun, but beer is also fun and yeah.

502
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,600
 And on that bombshell, that was the Hooked to Thought podcast.

503
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
 And it's goodbye from me.

504
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,400
 It's goodbye from me.

505
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,600
 And it's goodbye from me.

506
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,360
 And we are off to the double barrel brewery for hijinks.

507
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:50,960
 I'm getting that out.

508
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,720
 We're not but that in the middle of the rest.

509
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,120
 What?

510
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,920
 That's definitely going.

511
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,160
 That will like pick up on the podcast and it's also going to be a nightmare to edit.

512
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,800
 Sorry, John.
