00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 Hello everyone, it's Jon here. Just before we get into the episode, Alison and Liz have asked

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,760
 me to put a small disclaimer at the start saying that there is less content than usual this week,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,880
 owing to us being live from punctuation too. So I realise this is how the sauce gets made.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
 I'm going to shout hang on so I get a comment and then Jon will edit that bit out when we

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,160
 actually edit the recording so it doesn't sound like I just shouted him. But I do.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,160
 Thanks.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:45,600
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 34th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction and

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,640
 science fiction fandom. This is the episode for the 24th of June 2021. I'm Jon Goxon.

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,560
 I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty. And did we mention we're coming live from punctuation too?

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,400
 We should mention that. We're coming live from punctuation too. We have a live audience of well

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,520
 43 but three of them are us so 40 and one of them is the person who's helping us so 30 died. So I

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,440
 think that's not bad actually. That's quite good. That's one of those is the transcription

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:21,280
 bot. So 38. Oh yeah okay so 38. They're falling away. And several of them are asleep so probably

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
 about two. Thank you all very much for coming along and watching us.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,960
 Right so Octa Thorpe today is sponsored by Stow shirts. Come and find us in the dealer's room

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:42,000
 by the punctuation too much or John is modeling a beautiful Octa Thorpe t-shirt. It's actually a

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,040
 crap Octa Thorpe t-shirt but you can't tell on the zoo. I've got him to complain and hopefully

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,360
 they'll be sending him a better one. They are. They are indeed. Did you hear back from them?

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,560
 They said we will send you a better one and I said thank you. Yeah so hopefully so if you

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,240
 get prints out the same then I'm gonna have to do something different for Octa Thorpe merch but

21
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,200
 anyway we have Octa Thorpe merch. We have punctuation too merch. We have all sorts of other merch

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,440
 for other conventions and also things that are not conventions at all and is that a minute yet John?

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,520
 Yeah okay so and and basically if you'd like to sponsor Octa Thorpe that's also a thing you could

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
 do because we now have quite a lot of cost to the fray and I'm looking at you Glasgow in 2024.

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:30,960
 We have a we have a reliable listenership of about I don't know 80 something like at least 10.

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,800
 So yeah so basically I wanted I wanted to buy a bit of software so I could do this. Oh for

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,080
 sake and something will happen when you do that. Yeah what will happen or is it a secret? Is it a

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,920
 secret? I don't think it's a secret. Didn't you just do it? I think I just did it. Do it again John.

29
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,000
 Hang on. Jesus. Oh all right okay I heard it that time.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,680
 Hang on why am I paying for you to make a soundboard of me swearing?

31
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,360
 It'll be grand. We have as ever some letters of comment but we also have a chat box

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:21,280
 so people are posting in the chat so DC says that they resent reliable and resents the implication

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:30,320
 that she is reliable so we'd like to say to out loud and is reliable and Roman says there's a lot

34
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,600
 of anger about the word reliable and I we apologize we did not mean to imply anyone was competent

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,320
 and we will uh fourth with acting away that makes it clear that no one is. That's not the sort of

36
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,960
 reliable I really meant in terms of Ange because Ange is the woman who walked out this morning with

37
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,240
 a cheese sandwich to a hotel. No reason other than to score points for her house. We're gonna talk

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,000
 about that later for sure. Um okay so we have letters of comment we have a letter of comment from

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,800
 DC starting out on a serious tone people which is DC points out that we said convergence would be

40
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,960
 the first in person science speech and convention to be held post pandemic and they point out that

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:18,000
 in fact we are still mid pandemic and um yes so uh it's tricky because obviously we mean kind of

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,080
 conventions that can happen now that vaccinations are underway and there's more um uh scope for that

43
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,000
 sort of thing but it is it is worth noting that obviously um is not just that we can ignore all

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,160
 of these issues so good point DC. I think there is an interesting question to add at some point about

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,560
 which point the pandemic becomes post pandemic and which point it becomes kind of covid is endemic

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,160
 I don't think we're at that point yet but there will be a point where that will happen or it will be on

47
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,640
 a country by country basis of whether you're sort of in a pandemic or in more of an endemic

48
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,000
 situation and that's maybe not too much discussion for punctuation and I thought while we're here we

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,560
 could look at Martine's letter of comment which is so they've already had a convention this year

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,000
 in Poland and in fact people are in fact chiming in with more conventions which have happened in

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,720
 person in various places already um which is interesting so places have had conventions you know

52
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,120
 how large they were because I was thinking convergence at you know probably up to 3000 could be one of

53
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,040
 the bigger ones that will have happened I don't know but I think I've also seen some of these sort of

54
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,800
 like the ones I consider to be like sort of gate show type things the sort of you know things with

55
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,080
 artists Ali and signing and so on I think some of those are already back but presumably they're

56
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,200
 very strong like commercial pressures to get those back so they may not be operating purely on what

57
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,440
 they think is you know for the best of the best option for fans and for fandom it may be what is

58
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,160
 the best option for their business to to exist and Griffin has pointed out that it's the world

59
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,760
 health organization that officially declares pandemics so they will officially declare the pandemic

60
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,600
 over however it strikes me that it's not necessarily in the world health organization's interest to

61
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,320
 officially declare the pandemic over until sometime after everybody's actually stopped treating us

62
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,520
 it's like a pandemic said so we don't know it doesn't feel like it's over yet to me thank you

63
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,880
 very much for writing in DC we also had a letter from Roman Ozansky who sent us some fanzines that

64
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,760
 he had written um that are electronic he sent us a whole zip archive which we could unzip and it

65
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:35,440
 was a website fanzine called the wild goose it was very good you could also find the wild goose on

66
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,120
 the internet which is a sort of new fangled sequence of tubes that you can get and we will put a link

67
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,400
 to that in the show notes but thank you very much Roman and Roman goes into quite a lot of detail

68
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,000
 on all the different kind of formats and their and their thoughts on them so so yeah no it was

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,920
 very good thank you very much for writing in Roman and Erwin Hirsch wrote to us and also talked a

70
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,600
 lot about fanzines that there have been and the formats in which John Foyster and Bruce Gillespie

71
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,640
 this must be kind of Australian obsession with fanzine with electronic fanzine formats really

72
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,720
 given that we've had lots of this from both Roman and Erwin and also that Bruce Gillespie has

73
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,920
 been publishing two versions of each SF commentary in both landscape and portrait so you can decide

74
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,400
 if you're going to get SF commentary and pridged out and read it or if you're going to read it on

75
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,200
 your device and which how you'd like it and he also says in the past couple of podcasts John has

76
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,240
 mentioned his fanzine is that available on the web somewhere if so can you put the link in the

77
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,280
 show notes John is your fanzine available on the web somewhere it is and in fact I wrote a new

78
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,480
 issue for crustaceans 14 is out at this very convention the last issue was in April 2014 so

79
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,720
 you know it's been a little while but yeah you can go to the fanzine lounge at this very convention

80
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,480
 and read it now and I will put links in the show notes and I also write Losing with Ispania my wife

81
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,720
 and I'll put a link to that in the show notes as well and we'll put a link to Alison's fanzine

82
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,600
 in the show notes because she's got a right one right one yeah she's looking at me very

83
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,160
 skeptically doing the official octa thought side eye and if you write very nicely to John

84
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,640
 then he might even send you a copy that appears magically on your gindle and you don't have to do

85
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,120
 anything but from you know turn the Wi-Fi on on your gindle and buy a kindle yeah okay yeah you'd

86
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,040
 have to buy one she she knows this secret trick because I sent one to her kindle can you send me

87
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,400
 one that appears automatically magically on my cobra email me listeners email me and tell me

88
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,000
 how you want my fanzine and presuming it's like acceptable and doesn't involve staples then I will

89
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,280
 comply what if I print out your podcast and put staples in it print out my podcast and put staples

90
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,120
 in it sorry no I wouldn't print out your podcast most everything that would be quite complicated

91
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,960
 what if I get the copy of procrastination she sent me print it out and put staples in it and

92
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,920
 then send you a photo so I happen to know that Mark Plummer of this parish indeed used to whack

93
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,120
 a couple of rexels through it as he termed in a lock once before reading it and maybe this is

94
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,640
 something we should add to the scavenger hunt a stapled fanzine I gotta go and put that in the

95
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,120
 air title I'm gonna put a stapled fanzine stapled copy of John's fanzine yep okay

96
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:40,640
 we also got another lock from Christopher J Garcia who has a new job well done Chris

97
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:49,680
 and he snipes me he says he was doing e-pubs of the drink tank in 2010 so I think that is our new

98
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:59,680
 winner for earliest e-pub I believe so well done to Chris yeah so I do I do sometimes take the

99
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,400
 Chris Garcia maybe when he is multitasking and listening to six podcasts and making dinner and

100
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,720
 also typing up a letter of comment maybe he types a little bit too fast because he hasn't

101
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:16,560
 been by saying most importantly we were filing cabinet so yeah we were filing cabinet I think

102
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,800
 there's probably something profound in that we are all filing cabinet Liz he's also been on his

103
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:33,520
 sweater vest yes thank you Chris we also did get um James Shields sent us dice of comment which I

104
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,320
 should probably mention well he said you dice of comment he didn't mean dice of comment

105
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:46,560
 didn't send me dice of comments so I bid I bid I bid on James Shields is at dice locked at

106
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,280
 confusion which was Eastcom and I got outbid by Esther who bid 120 pounds on the dice and then

107
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,200
 sent them to me which was very kind of her thank you Esther and so I got my octa my octa condai and

108
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:07,920
 I got my Glasgow in 2024 die and I got my Dublin in 2019 die and I got my New Zealand in 2020 die

109
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,880
 and I got my Chacon 8 die but I also got two octa-thorp dice so these are clear purple

110
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:23,760
 eight-sided dice that have the octa-thorp on the eight and they are wonderful and I am very happy

111
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:32,240
 with them so thank you very much to James Shields for including these as a brussey bonus in my

112
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,680
 lot of dice I very much appreciate it thank you James and I've put a picture on the gram

113
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,480
 which I will link in the show notes so that people can see who were not at punctuation too

114
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,040
 although if you weren't at punctuation too did you really live this is the question I have tried

115
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,080
 to put up my new Shieldsie as a service ribbon as a background to this but I don't think it's

116
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,400
 worked properly I'll do it again another time

117
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:10,720
 The convention is going well we mentioned the scavenger hunt and I want to talk about the scavenger

118
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,960
 hunt because long-time listeners to the podcast will remember that we mentioned the PicoCon

119
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:24,640
 scavenger hunt way back in a episode of octa-thorp that happened in February and I contacted the

120
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,280
 person who wrote the bot that PicoCon used for their scavenger hunt and cheerfully forked it on

121
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:41,120
 on github and made it work for us and then we had 90 items in our scavenger hunt and it has been

122
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,920
 going very well and so far my favorite is that I put after Carrie mentioned liking cheese sandwiches

123
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,880
 in hotels at some point yesterday I put a picture of a cheese sandwich outside a hotel in the

124
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,320
 scavenger hunt yesterday and then we've had lots of photos of people outside hotels with cheese

125
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,240
 sandwiches which is I I am very much enjoying very much enjoying this part of the convention

126
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:15,040
 we also asked for a recreation of the punctuation to logo in an art form of your choice and I think

127
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,720
 John is modeling one of the submissions for that this is Andrew January's submission

128
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,080
 I we we haven't even better one but it's it was not quite finished in time to use it as backdrop so

129
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,120
 if you wait if you wait to see me at the closing ceremony I'll be I'll be using that as my closing

130
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:39,520
 ceremony backdrop I think and we will be opening these scavenger hunt channels at the end of the

131
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,560
 convention so if you're curious about what other houses did for their alternate punctuation to art

132
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,960
 then you can kind of go through and have a look at the closing ceremony and afterwards we may try

133
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:58,320
 to create a highlight reel for you to for you to particularly be in or off but I don't know I mean

134
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,840
 a list a list of things that we particularly recommend people go and look at because there

135
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 have been some excellent submissions if you're not doing the scavenger hunt then there is still

136
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,440
 time you are in a house go and go and join in but it is a great way to have fun and I I think

137
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,960
 John and I both had quite a lot of fun at Pika-Con playing the scavenger hunt and so we want to

138
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,920
 do it here in that form and it does seem to go down quite well I think last time I suggested

139
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,920
 we have houses and that we have some kind of competition and it would be fun and everyone was

140
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,200
 like oh it will be like enforced fun like being in a school house and I don't think we did a huge

141
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 amount with it at Punctuation Mall we had some points but I also forget kept forgetting to post

142
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,000
 like a house points update but this time it's not everyone in a house but each of the houses I think

143
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,160
 has got quite into it and they are doing things like leaving the house at AM to go and take a photo

144
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,000
 of a cheese sandwich in front of our hotel or doing spontaneous art or writing folk songs

145
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,400
 and I love it it's kind of like the task master thing where even if it's quite a silly task

146
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,120
 it's quite a silly item you have to get but then everyone's like oh points I like points

147
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:14,160
 what do points mean prizes well they don't we don't have any prizes apart from maybe you can

148
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,880
 probably have a ribbon yeah we don't have any prizes are we maybe should have told people that

149
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,280
 they'll be a ribbon and you know bragging rights yeah I mean everyone's doing this just like bragging

150
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,120
 rights and yeah as the Spanish says in the chat for the glory and I'm amazed that it turns out

151
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,200
 people will voluntarily do things like wear silly hats and you know the contents of a witch's closet

152
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:45,360
 and running around with cheese sandwiches well I'd also um so I don't know so Liz has um found a

153
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,320
 downside to living in uh Thailand uh which is that when I because someone bought

154
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,760
 Claire Booth Be a Cake uh because Claire had put in the scavenger hunt by a member of

155
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,440
 Star for Cake and I was like this is a good wheeze so the next day when we uploaded more I added by

156
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,400
 a committee member a cake I would not have let him do this I would not let him do this I should

157
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,440
 say if the committee had noticed before they'd gone up I would have said that scavenger hunt items

158
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,600
 that involve bribing the committee are are inappropriate and should not be allowed I'm just saying

159
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,080
 however also and also nobody has sent me a cake and my addresses in the show notes right anyway

160
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,840
 oh no no Alison you're you're you're actually not correct on that so Andrew January sent me this

161
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,280
 coster bag of cakes which is very nice thank you Andrew January Emily January sent Claire Briarley

162
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:43,360
 of Croydon a cake which was I think some cupcakes but I believe I just saw that someone has indeed

163
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,240
 um placed an order for a cake to come to Wartham's though Alison so I believe you are about to receive

164
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:59,280
 some cake um oh no no don't do that oh god I have actually not I have actually not put my address

165
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,760
 in the show notes anywhere because I do I do think they should not bribe committee members in this

166
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,680
 way I feel bad about it so but on the other hand it's on its way I said I do also love cake thank

167
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:18,560
 you very much and also I bought like 12 brownies for yesterday and they've all gone and I can't

168
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:25,360
 really blame my cohabities that much I think I think I have eaten more than my fair share of brownies

169
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,480
 so yeah I did get I did get delivered cake by by my husband also and beer there are there are

170
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,320
 photographs um yes indeed um but no the I have been I've been super super happy like I was a bit

171
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,520
 worried that I'd feel left out of the coverage home because obviously we cannot participate because

172
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:52,720
 we have to be the people scoring that's also great fun oh yeah but scoring it has almost been more

173
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,000
 fun yeah like it is so good I don't know how many houses I have now told that their aug is not

174
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,520
 off enough I loved um Special shout out to Vanessa who's Dalek and Dalek in disguise

175
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,440
 well I really love quite a lot I really like that but all of the submissions have been phenomenal

176
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,480
 thank you all so much for for really getting into it um Liz I put I put in that I put the one in

177
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,920
 which shows a pop sign with lots of legs and my intention was you get like as many points as

178
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,840
 there were legs on the pop sign that turns out to be quite difficult but now I love that everyone's

179
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,200
 anticipating how many legs is lots of legs does this pub sign having a plague is again there's lots

180
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,760
 of legs it's very good yeah they were kind of like is this pub side good enough and I'm like

181
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,560
 no how many legs do we need not one too many lots yeah um indeed indeed

182
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,000
 uh there was a controversy and we should discuss it here it's a serious business and it's one that

183
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,320
 shouldn't be treated lightly and that is is getting up at 10 a.m. early some members of the

184
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:10,160
 convention have strenuously denied such charges and claim that it is not early and that there are

185
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,240
 earlier times um so Alison and Liz let's discuss this controversy now oh god it's early

186
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:27,520
 the problem is now that I am old yeah I I kind of like well if we're doing parkrun or not parkrun

187
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,160
 on Saturday we can do stroll within the entities which is kind of like a riff on worldcon stroll

188
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,360
 with the stars because we don't have any stars we we only have the entities a convention stroll at

189
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,800
 9 a.m. on sunday that will make perfect sense and Liz said yes who should I put that down for it

190
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,880
 and I said me I'll find somebody to volunteer to look after it later could anyone spot the

191
00:19:50,880 --> 00:20:01,680
 the tiny floor in this plan you'll get around to it later 9 o'clock this morning I went for a walk

192
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,600
 but lots of other people did just well we had about I think we had about 10 of us on the walk and

193
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:13,680
 it was good including Liz who was not walking in the cool fresh post-rain air of waltz and stow she

194
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:21,200
 was walking in the 38 degree baking heat of tylen did the mid-afternoon how empty was your parkless

195
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
 so the park was quite empty I mean it's a small park walking in the park was lovely the problem is

196
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,720
 I have to walk to and from the park in the street and it is incredibly hot and then I had to

197
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,760
 essentially come back and drink a large ice drink and shower to cool down enough to do a podcast

198
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,640
 so there are certain floors at this but yeah I was gonna say I am I'm old now like I would have said

199
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,400
 10 o'clock was horrendously early especially for a convention where I will have been up till you

200
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,560
 know three or four or something but now actually I just wake up at 8 30 it's bit despite you really

201
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,240
 I have woken up the last two days just slightly too late to cycle the zoom but I mean it's been

202
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:05,200
 okay I think yes no one noticed um indeed the chat seems to be about um about basically and

203
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,240
 things it isn't early and everyone else seems pretty agreed that it is um I think the best one is

204
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,360
 Maggie who says there are earlier times but she does not necessarily wish to experience them

205
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,280
 and that is a fair way of looking at it I think. Farah does not think tylen o'clock is early as

206
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,600
 we know because Farah was um at the vanguard of can you have parties earlier in the day and we had a

207
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,600
 birthday's party at 2 p.m. In particular the voxel party which could not be earlier in the day

208
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,600
 because if you're going to drink a vast amount of whiskey then fall over you do not want to do

209
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 that at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and if you do then um we'll just like talk to us like it's fine

210
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:53,200
 but like reach out yeah no no there's help available yeah we have whiskey and Max has said in chat

211
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,480
 live action feedback uptime and not uptime have all blurred into one big puppy care session and

212
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,080
 I don't know what awake even is now that's fair Farah defends herself there are afternoon

213
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,800
 alcoholic drinks gnt pims and that is a good point pims pims is very good in the sunshine at about

214
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,240
 2 o'clock in the afternoon okay we are going to have an afternoon pims party at punctuation three

215
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,160
 you heard it three here first because somebody tagged that in the next five channel so we don't

216
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,120
 forget it uh what she might have was so no I mean and don't get me wrong I'm always up for pims

217
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,680
 Farah is hosting the pims party hehehe now that is how you make a party

218
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,840
 you heard it here yep you could get pims delivered from a number of excellent pims delivery

219
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,680
 companies like sainsbury's tascos and a cardo I found out alby's does an off brand pims which

220
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,560
 is apparently almost as good as the real thing and significantly cheaper um I think you probably

221
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,880
 discovered that from James Bacon who um used it for doubling parties I think because you could

222
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,200
 basically make a ton of pims using geeves I think it's called I think it is something like that for

223
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:14,720
 something like a third of the cost right we should um i've just had a letter of comment it was sent

224
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,920
 to only me for some reason and uh it's from the British Science Fiction Association and it says

225
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,600
 that they're having an AGM which as you listen to this listener if you listen to it on the first

226
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,000
 day it's available will be in two days time and there is um a guest of honor talk by alle

227
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:41,120
 alizone scoot alizone scoot you know about her she seems a bit dodgy um the convention is called

228
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,800
 "conspire yenui" who I do not know on twitter said "I cannot wait to hear from allison on fandom

229
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,480
 experiences that seems to reflect our digital culture that is rooted in convergence culture

230
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,240
 and theory and participatory revolution" and I saw that tweet and I thought oh well she's clearly

231
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,920
 looking forward to my talk but on the other hand I felt like a rabbit caught in headlights because

232
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,400
 the current state of my talk which is called "my year in virtual fandom" is kind of at the

233
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:21,360
 I've been on zoom a lot recently level so I feel that in order to meet yens expectations I'm

234
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,240
 gonna have to raise my game quite a bit of the next week um two days is your listening to this but

235
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,280
 by the time you're listening to this I will be much closer to her having written my talk narrator

236
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,000
 she won't have been um which means the time will not have done it but I will actually be panicking

237
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,920
 by then okay yeah that I believe that I believe Liz are you gonna go to the bsfaagm to listen to

238
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,600
 alizone talk about having been on zoom a lot so so I mean I'm gonna say to alizone that

239
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,000
 possibly ring the Hugo voter pack and then an online convention and then going to an online

240
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,760
 convention where you have to give a speech which maybe start you see many things for a six week

241
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,920
 period the same okay so I've been thinking about this because I've become very self-reflective and

242
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,160
 I've concluded that the last couple of months when I have prepared the Hugo voter pack and planed

243
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,480
 done help with the planning of punctuation have been quite full but I would probably have been

244
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:26,800
 able to cope if I had not additionally inserted 205 hours of Hades which is a video 205 hours

245
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:33,840
 that's a job I mean right I think it's important I think it's important to contextualize this

246
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:42,720
 that's eight and a half days I think of the 205 hours only about four of that was in four days of

247
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,080
 that was in entire days and that's the sort of day where you wake up go oh I'm awake I can play

248
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,640
 Hades and then two o'clock the following morning you go oh I should stop now and go to sleep oh none

249
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:02,800
 of my limbs were properly so yes um alizone alizone has been enjoying Hades um but I'm sure it will

250
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,120
 be a great bs-fay talk as well and I'm gonna go I've not been a member of the bs-fay for the AGM

251
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,200
 before but I'm gonna go with that that was the thing I was gonna say is that you can only go to

252
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,920
 full thing if you are a member of the bs-fay or the science fiction foundation um and I'm not

253
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,400
 currently a member of either so I might try and do the thing I think they've got some spare tickets

254
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,360
 you can pick up on event bright or something yeah I think it's free and you can get spare tickets

255
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,640
 I you know and if not yeah but I've got a I've got to actively go and get the spare tickets rather than

256
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,360
 like spontaneously waking up and going oh I can go watch Alice's talk so there is a small amount

257
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,040
 of activation and if not I'm sure I can hit them up for a guest list so I will probably go to some

258
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,840
 bits of it but I have to sort of register session by uh session and go and get them off twitter so

259
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,680
 which is perfectly reasonable I should say it's perfectly reasonable that um yeah I hope they've

260
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,080
 invited me to the whole day you know if you're members of these organizations you can go to their

261
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,080
 whole day and otherwise you pick up some free tickets I just haven't done it they've sent me

262
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,040
 a link so I hope I'm hoping that'll do for the whole day otherwise I might have to give them a

263
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,680
 paddock to not stare or something I think if you're like I guess you get to go to the whole thing yes

264
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:19,440
 I hope so um you think wouldn't you yeah yeah and right in the chat as a member of the BSFA

265
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:27,120
 do I have to register on this link too I don't think you do because um I think I have a link to

266
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,520
 the zoom link in my emails right at this very point um so and I think if you check your emails

267
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,720
 you might find that the same is true um and indeed FARA in the chat confirms my suspicions

268
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,360
 so thank you very much but it will be good um I have been a member of the BSFA for

269
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:55,120
 ooh months now and I'm looking forward to diving in seeing what's up and we have for those of you

270
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,920
 at the convention we have a panel coming up later which is entitled what did the UK's

271
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,640
 national genre organizations ever do for us in which we discussed the role of the BSFA and

272
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,000
 the British Francis Society and the Science Fiction Foundation in British fandom and um as you listen

273
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,040
 to this if you were a member of punctuation 2 I believe you can check the catch up program link

274
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,760
 because I believe it will be up for another week on an unlisted youtube link but that is off the

275
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,720
 top of my head but I'm pretty sure it is being recorded for some length of time um so do check

276
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,440
 back um but it will be a good panel and HARA yeah I'm moderating it so I like your your faith in me

277
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:45,360
 John thank you one of the other things that's been nice about um this weekend is that we've had

278
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,440
 representation from Winnipeg in 2023 and we went to their party last night and lost asked them lots

279
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:59,520
 of questions about Winnipeg I feel like they weren't necessarily the most relevant to the world

280
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,280
 con because a lot of them like is it true that it never goes above freezing point and is

281
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:12,720
 Winnipeg the city that the song Red River Valley was written about and um what did Winnipeg ever do

282
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:20,480
 for us anyway and isn't Winnipeg just a hipster version of um North London can you get mousse cheese

283
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,200
 we asked about mousse cheese we did we talked about mousse cheese and I discovered a source

284
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:34,000
 for mousse cheese that costs six hundred and seventy five dollars a kilo yep um so I'm not

285
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,960
 not I have a kind of hard limit on the amount I'm prepared to pay for cheese and it's significantly

286
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,560
 less than that I mean I'm not sure I would have said I did have a hard limit but significantly

287
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:51,680
 more than Ian Sorensen who I discovered bought 14 pounds worth of cheese and then was surprised

288
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:58,640
 to discover that got eaten up quite quickly by three visitors I'll hang on you mean 14 pounds

289
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,520
 as in sterling rather than I mean as in um fake kilos yeah I mean 14 pounds sterling which is about

290
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,360
 as much cheese as I ate for dinner yesterday yeah we had too much cheese his family was genuinely

291
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,560
 worried she might be having a heart attack and then she was like oh no it's probably just I ate

292
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,920
 too much cheese um which tells you how much cheese she had eaten oh yeah well she'd actually

293
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,120
 done that on top of that cake that she was describing that consisted of you make a cake and then it's

294
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,200
 using many different sorts of cream and then it's not creamy enough so you tip another couple of

295
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,560
 pints of cream into it was that that's right is it not it's got an entire liter of cream in it

296
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:40,000
 and then it's also got condensed and evaporated milk so it's quite good it's a very good cake

297
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,200
 like you can confirm ah is it healthy no my long-time associates know the time extremely fond of

298
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,160
 cardamom buns as sold by the fabric bakery and for briex recipe turned up in the guardian and I

299
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,840
 discovered the reason that they're so good is that there was essentially about a kilogram of butter

300
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,160
 in the recipe that's like oh that you can make anything more delicious by putting more butter in

301
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:15,520
 it yes indeed um so DC says mistakes were made by everybody in response to espania saying mistakes

302
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,160
 were made and that is true I also ate too much cheese and then I had some beer and then espania

303
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,840
 made me a cocktail called a suffering bastard and yeah you know it's a convention I woke up this

304
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,800
 morning late and bleary which is good John was the last per last committee member up this morning

305
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:40,240
 which I think is pretty unusual yes that has happened before when we had the 8am committee

306
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,280
 meeting and John went straight from bed to meeting oh yeah that's right having agreed to having an

307
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:53,840
 8am committee meeting John didn't really turn up till about 8.25 and he was in his pajamas in a way

308
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:01,040
 that was kind of like I have clearly rolled out of bed on to zoom I woke up and I checked my phone

309
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,920
 and it had a message on it from one Alison Scott saying 'Oi meeting at eight' and I looked at the

310
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,520
 clock and I thought 'oh bugger' and then I went to a meeting very quickly and that was a good way to

311
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,640
 wake up with texts from me explaining why he should have been somewhere sometime earlier

312
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:24,320
 Griffin in the chat has said 'this is why brioche keeps fresh for so long' and I can confirm that

313
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,440
 in my house brioche keeps fresh for about two minutes after which there is no brioche that is fair

314
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,440
 Farah says that buffalo cheese was located by Farah at the local artisanal market today

315
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,680
 and as that moose and elk are the only dairy cheeses Farah can eat this was very happy making

316
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,800
 yeah weirdie I couldn't find any local buffalo cheese I thought this is a lot of

317
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,800
 water buffalo maybe there would be a buffalo cheese market but I haven't found it I have

318
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:59,440
 also discovered that actually eating a load of cheese at midnight is not really a great idea in

319
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:06,560
 terms of smooth sleeping it's supposed to give you interesting dreams it did not give me interesting

320
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,000
 dreams it gave me indigestion well I think that's why it gives people interesting dreams right

321
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,720
 yes but I regularly very large amounts of cheese at midnight so I don't regularly eat a lot of cheese

322
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,240
 you see yeah there's no time of day at which I don't eat too much cheese I want to say thank you

323
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,840
 very much to Anna after for proposing and getting the gin tasting started sadly Anna was ill on

324
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,800
 Friday so couldn't make it but we were very grateful for her leadership and it was a good time

325
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,720
 and I very much enjoyed my gins thank you very much to and for suggesting a box of cheeses for

326
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,480
 the cheese tasting and for leading us through the discussion thereof on the zoom yesterday

327
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,120
 and then a preemptive thank you to the unity brewing company the head brewer Jimmy will be

328
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,840
 leading us through some of unity's beers later today and that will also be brilliant

329
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,040
 and the tastings were one of the best bits of punctuation one in my opinion and so this time I

330
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,640
 was very glad that we kind of did a more focused thing where people actually had the same stuff

331
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,680
 if they wanted to and it has been it has been a real joy so thank you everyone for leading those

332
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,720
 and thank you also everyone who came along and made them so so great really really enjoyed all three

333
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,960
 although there wasn't an official cake for the birthday's party I think an afternoon birthday's

334
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,720
 party with lots of cake was also a good plan oh yes yesterday all i ate was unhealthy breakfast

335
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,480
 cake and cheese yeah we got we got our fry up delivered and then we went and then it's

336
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,520
 banya had the sf cookbooks panel so she brought me a cookie and then it's banya had the birthdays

337
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,640
 party so she brought me a cake and then some time passed and then Andrew had some cake delivered

338
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,240
 to me for the scavenger hunt and then it was the cheese tasting and that was my that was my day

339
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:56,640
 and um there's not it was so good it was so good i can't i can't emphasize enough how great it was

340
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,000
 but it was very healthy but it was good i think what we've discovered is that socializing centered

341
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,680
 around food and specifically food that you can go out and get in advance and procure and think about

342
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,360
 is actually quite a good way of structuring your socializing when we're all in different rooms

343
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,880
 so it gives us some kind of connection between us and also gives people you know some some specific

344
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,320
 reason to be partying rather than just we're having a party although i do regret that i didn't buy any

345
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,600
 birthday candles put in my birthday cake that was my failing

346
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:38,800
 do any of you have any questions for ask och to thought i mean to be fair in the chat so um we did

347
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,840
 ask what we what people wanted us to talk about and griffin did say that he wanted multiple letters

348
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,400
 of comment from clever i live croydon and clairn ottie she's quite a few episodes behind and mark

349
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,920
 did explain them that is because she's been spending too much time playing arkam horror um so there is

350
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,480
 that um so oh my god malcom we should have done that um malcom in the chat says with lizzie's

351
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,040
 suggestion that that um he should send out chocolate lists and yes absolutely how did we not i'm

352
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:15,360
 sorry hashtag next time hashtag next time um now um and will john insert the sound effect correctly

353
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:23,120
 in the final edit i mean i'll have a go uh never say never um and then dc they want us to do some

354
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:31,600
 of the scurrilous gossip i could talk about time zones i could talk about um if you i mean this doesn't

355
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,440
 this doesn't count here because this is part of the octa thought um collective and also part of

356
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,080
 the committee so we have to we are very happy to make some allowances for the fact that she's um

357
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:48,320
 seven hours ahead six we're not willing to get the number of hours you are ahead right but

358
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:56,800
 we're willing we're willing to make allowances six hours ahead but in general if we're one of the

359
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,480
 reasons why we specified punctuation as a british convention was that there is another model you

360
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,160
 could have for online conventions where you really get into the global thing and you really do set

361
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,440
 it up so that it is a 24 hour thing with program happening all around the clock that really brings

362
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,680
 in people from around the world and i think that is a great model and somebody i would really like

363
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,400
 somebody to take that and run with it um but it's not the model of punctuation which means that we

364
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:32,000
 are thrilled that people join us from um all around the world but that but when you say oh it's a shame

365
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,680
 you've put on something interesting at 11 o'clock in the morning we're kind of like three o'clock

366
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,120
 in the morning um we're like well you know you can just stay up for it or get up for it you know

367
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,480
 tough so i would say yeah i think it'd be great to do that but actually it's quite a lot of effort

368
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,320
 to put on a days worth of things during the times when people in the UK are awake and it would make

369
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,800
 things a lot more complicated because i already was thinking like in a few cases it's like oh this

370
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,040
 person would be great for that panel right then i must you know i can only put it in these two or

371
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,800
 three times locked when everyone is awake and that makes things more difficult and a couple of times

372
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,200
 it was like oh this person's just joining they might be great for this item but too late i've

373
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,440
 already scheduled it in and it's at you know 2 a.m their time so that is difficult but i would say

374
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,560
 there is an example who does do a good job of it which is firecon did this they did last year

375
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,800
 an architect to do the firecon fringe where they essentially will have 12 hours of programming

376
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,480
 running in the 12 hours when east coast USA is not really awake so i think it was sort of 9 p.m

377
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,440
 to 9 a.m and is deliberately made for people who are outside that time zone and that is still

378
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,760
 free so you can still go and watch that even if you don't go to the rest of the convention so they're

379
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,200
 doing a really good job of it and there's so much to look at but last year i think they ran it by

380
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,160
 almost having two two kind of separate things there were people who ranked the fringe bit and people

381
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,680
 running the regular bit so that's how you do it you've got to have multiple teams i think

382
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:02,080
 i haven't quite realized that firecon fringe was was convention for the off hours because i was

383
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:08,640
 expecting it to be more kind of convention adjacent activity is what i tend to think of fringes being

384
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,160
 well if anyone if anyone did want to run a punctuation fringe with some sort of

385
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:22,080
 amusing punctuation team name that ran in the times when we were asleep then i would not stop them

386
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,800
 but i i think it also does need i mean in this case i think it was a group of people who were

387
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,120
 you know very keen to have some something happening in their in their time zone

388
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,480
 in you know in the same way that firecon works so basically we would need a fairly dedicated team

389
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,760
 i think of people who are non-uk and dedicated enough that they you know i think most of our

390
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,400
 Australians are happy to just try and get some program in the time zones when they are awake

391
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,120
 british bradshaw suggests we call it the punctuation bangs which i like a great deal

392
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:59,520
 um that's amazing so if anyone would like to run the punctuation bangs the next time

393
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,640
 to it's worth it for the joke people for the joke i mean i think we may have to do it ourselves

394
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,280
 actually we can't actually be in charge of it because it will be in the middle of the night but

395
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:19,280
 that is a great great name it is i'm i'm yes yeah no brilliant i'm banging

396
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:28,560
 uh do you hear me uh jerry we can't repeat that on the podcast it's a family show jerry you're

397
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,040
 already going to be beeping out you've actually got things on your auto thing that you then have to

398
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:43,600
 be pat of the podcast i mean look right that is not the point it's a family show and that was

399
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:50,320
 the octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

400
00:40:51,280 --> 00:41:10,640
 [Music]

401
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,360
 i've realized john that you know one of the people things that people of this is actual

402
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,000
 content for octa thought which i'm doing terrible thing now um one of the things that people have

403
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,120
 said about online conventions is that they don't like the feeling of talking into a void of having

404
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:31,600
 your audience out there but not being able to see them or have them react and i would like to say

405
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:38,320
 that doing a podcast for a year really helps with this feeling yeah we just recommend that

406
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,600
 everyone who is struggling with this just just do 34 episodes of a podcast and you'll you'll be all

407
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,840
 right um is that and may not be helpful no it's um it's interesting it is but it is definitely true

408
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,240
 that when we do the live podcast it is very fun to have the chat going and like see everyone like

409
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,320
 reacting in real time that is uh it's phenomenal um so thank you all very much for coming i'm not

410
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:07,520
 sure it makes for an actual coherent podcast like i think it's possible doing the live ones maybe

411
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,320
 makes the actual later recorded podcasts slightly less good because we are a bit like disjointing

412
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,680
 tonight we pick up lots of stuff from the comments yeah i don't know how the i don't know how the

413
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,440
 serious podcast we stole our format from um manages this we should we should pay some more

414
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,600
 attention really i think the record for longer is part of it i think the live episodes are off

415
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:35,680
 for quite long and then then get edited quite sharply one i think also they um they do um uh

416
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,960
 they because we've done one live recording which we did standalone after confusion where we basically

417
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,760
 just did the regular show in the chat burbled in the background and that felt less fun to me than

418
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,600
 doing one where we pay a lot of attention to the chat and kind of interact a lot but i think probably

419
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,520
 what they do is mostly ignore the chat unless they want like information out of it which is good from

420
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,680
 their perspective but less good for fostering the community feel the theme music for this episode was
