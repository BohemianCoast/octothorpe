1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Listen, you've gone very quiet, which is good because that means I can just say something right?

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:13,680
 I think you may have changed microphone because you sound less clear. So while Alison is sorting

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,960
 out her microphone. Hello everyone and welcome to the very 50th episode of the OctaThought podcast.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,080
 This is the episode for the first of October 2020. I'm John Coxson. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,280
 Batty. And who'd have thought we'd still be doing this in October?

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:40,880
 Yep. Or that we'd stick to a schedule. Yes, I have retroactively edited our release date so the

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,640
 schedule looks more coherent than it actually was. But don't tell anyone. It was pretty coherent.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,760
 Yeah, we've been doing I think we've been doing pretty well. Coming out on a Wednesday or Thursday

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:04,480
 every other week. So that is nice. We have had a debatable plethora of locks because roughly half

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,440
 of the locks were to chime in on whether or not it was acceptable to use the word plethora. So

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:20,000
 yes, let's do them in some sort of order. So the first lock was from...

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,400
 Well, actually no. So the first lock was from Claire Briarley and she wrote us about episode 13.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,640
 But we got the episode, we got the letter of comment after we had recorded episode 14.

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,000
 Claire does not think it's a good idea to introduce virtual ribbons to online conventions.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,680
 I suspect this is because she dislikes ribbons in all their forms. Is that possibly on presence?

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,320
 Yeah, I think if you like ribbons, the idea of virtual ribbons is great. If you think ribbons

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,480
 are already in abomination then I can't see a virtual ribbon is going to convince you. Although

18
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,480
 it probably is better for the environment. I guess so. Yeah, I would assume so. Probably.

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,440
 No, I think ribbons are a major cause of environmental damage.

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,920
 That's fair. We haven't... Here at the Altitop podcast we have not commissioned any research into

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,600
 the environmental impact of ribbons. Also in Claire's lock on episode 13, she says, "I think the

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,960
 Marvel Cinematic Universe would be improved if some scenes were replaced by a caption card,

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,360
 stating five to ten minutes of implausible fighting ensued." And I wanted to read this

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,920
 out because A) I have watched multiple Marvel Cinematic Universe movies since our last episode,

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,360
 but also I too am now in the habit of sitting in my living room going, "This is boring now,

26
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,880
 isn't it? Is it boring? Steven, is this boring and Steven going?" It depends if you like that

27
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,280
 sort of thing. There's no car chases, Dr Strange. So this is what substitutes for a car

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,800
 chase in this one. Great I go, that's still very tedious. Could we just get onto the character

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,240
 development bit and have I just watched a female character dying in order to further the character

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,600
 development of a man? Oh probably. Should they really be doing that sort of thing? Probably not.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,680
 God these movies are terrible. When are we watching the next one? But if the fight scenes were shorter,

32
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,920
 I wouldn't have time to think about how bad the movies were until after I finished watching them.

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,880
 What I would like Alison is you and Liz are both aware that I've started my own Arkham horror

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,880
 podcast on the side. I would like you to start a podcast which is you recording Alison and Steve

35
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,760
 commentaries of MCU films that I could sync up the audio to the film and listen to it as if I was

36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,080
 watching with you because I think that would be quite funny. I think it would make lots of people

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,560
 very angry. So yes. Oh god I could have done a good one for Dr Strange. Steven was like, "Oh,

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:54,400
 um, so you thought that Tony Stark was a bit of a git?" But that's the emotional journey Alison.

39
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,680
 He says it's a less of a bit of a git. And then there's a white lady playing an Asian lady,

40
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:07,360
 but she's not Asian so it's fine. This attracted some criticism at the time. I would argue that

41
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,920
 one of the things that makes the better MCU films better is that they use their fight scenes

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,960
 in a way as to further character development and often do kind of intelligent and slightly,

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,360
 I'd put it. They often do fight scenes which go just a bit beyond we've got two guys in robot

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
 suits and they're going to put each other. So I would say like, I really like Captain America

45
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,400
 the Wind Soldier, which I think uses its fight scenes basically to do the emotional development

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,400
 between Captain America and the Wind Soldier or Thor Agnerock where you get Thor and he meets the Hulk

47
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,440
 or a lot of the ones in Black Panther. Whereas the ones in sort of like, I'd say Iron Man 2,

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,040
 which is somewhere down at the bottom of the MCU rankings as some really boring fight scenes.

49
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,280
 And it's just like guys shooting each other with the giant robot suits.

50
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,120
 Okay. So the other thing I wanted to say about Dr Strange, none of this might go in the podcast.

51
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,880
 I may have to do a different MCU podcast, is that when I was a teenager, I lived in America and in

52
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,320
 every shopping mall in America, there was a shop called Spencer Gifts and the back and the final

53
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,520
 third of the shop of Spencer Gifts was a black light room which was full of black light posters,

54
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,000
 which I thought was just about the most amazing place on earth when I was 13. And anyway, the final

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,480
 third of Dr Strange, this might be a spoiler, is like the back end of Spencer Gifts in 1979.

56
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,800
 Almost exactly. My main comment on Iron Man 2 is that Iron Man 2 has one of the best villains

57
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:51,680
 in the MCU, which is Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Hammer and I love him. And it also has one of the

58
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:59,120
 most boring villains in the MCU, which is Mickey Rock's portrayal of whatever his name is.

59
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,160
 And it's a real shame. Slappy guy. Slappy guy. That's the guy. And like, it's a real shame because

60
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,160
 I think Iron Man 2, if it had focused way more on the Tony Stark, Sam Rockwell thing, would have been

61
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,080
 so good because I love Sam Rockwell. I love him in that role. But just a good third of the movie is

62
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,760
 a tedious Russian man. And it's like, I feel like Iron Man 2 pulled its punches that the final line

63
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,240
 of the movie, this is probably a spoiler. Yes, the final line of a movie does tend to be a spoiler.

64
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,240
 Is somebody saying, is it amazing how annoying a little prick can be?

65
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:44,400
 And if you actually take that as the text for the movie that Iron Man 2 is a film which

66
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,240
 Stark does not get a redemptive arc, he is in fact completely appalling from the beginning to the

67
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:58,800
 end of it, despite the fact that he's nominally the hero. And Sam Rockwell, as you say, has quite

68
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,360
 a nuanced role despite the fact that he is clearly intended to be the villain. These are both scare

69
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,480
 quotes things. And clearly, there was a much cleverer film in there trying to get out. But

70
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,760
 eventually someone went, oh no, no, you have to sympathise with Tony Stark. I don't sympathise

71
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:24,080
 with Tony Stark. I feel that Tony Stark really needs a slap. And anyway, no doubt Iron Man 3 will

72
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,360
 convince me, but I am not, I am not persuaded. Iron Man 3 is a very, very different movie.

73
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,400
 And anyway, Doctor Strange also a git. Also gets his character development through The Death of Women,

74
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,720
 which really pisses me off here in 2020 or whenever it was produced 2016, already a trope they should

75
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,960
 not be using. Okay, so I've got two comments. Firstly, Iron Man 2, I sympathise with Tony Stark,

76
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,160
 he's dying and he's sad about it. Like, he is a git, but he's lashing out because he's dying.

77
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,320
 I know, many people who have known that they were dying and who were sad about it, and who in fact

78
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,400
 were in fact dying, rather than it that merely being yet another plot point, and who nevertheless

79
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,560
 were honourable, noble, look at Martin Bennett, who permanently improved the state of British folk

80
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,160
 music after he discovered he was dying. You know, because it's if you're dying, you might have

81
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,280
 made decisions with a shitty, and I quite like sympathising with a character who makes him

82
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,840
 chitty-sitting. I quite like a film of our character who is in a shitty situation and makes

83
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,000
 shitty decisions even though you sympathise with him. I thought that was well done. I have never...

84
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
 Ah, ah, I see what the problem here was. I sympathised with a bit with the fact that he was dying,

85
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,280
 but I didn't sympathise with him because he's a tosser. But I don't think... yes. I think when

86
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,160
 you are angry, you have made shitty decisions that I still like you and sympathise with you.

87
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,120
 So I think in general it is okay that I could view characters and films and sympathise with

88
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,640
 them even when they make shitty decisions. Um... and I'm not saying he covers itself in glory,

89
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,480
 but I still like... yeah. Shall we move on to Claire's second letter? Yes. I will... Can I say about the

90
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,720
 third Marvel movie I've watched first, which was Captain Marvel? No, you didn't put any of this in

91
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,560
 the show notes. You can put it in the show notes, Alison, and then we might let you talk about it,

92
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,760
 but till then, you can see yourself on the notice. You can have one minute on Captain Marvel,

93
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,480
 which is I would quite like Marvel to make a movie where a woman is the lead character,

94
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,680
 and we don't have the origin story for a man and the man stealing all the scenes, please.

95
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,760
 I don't know who you mean, but I really... I don't really think any men did steal the...

96
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,000
 like, I don't understand how a man... Oh, okay, so Captain Marvel is the origin story of Nick Fury,

97
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,240
 and Nick Fury gets all the good lines and the good scene. And you haven't noticed that because

98
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,200
 you're a man. No, I think I didn't notice that because I really liked Rylaarsson. I think you might

99
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,240
 not have noticed it because you don't like women enough, Alison. Did you consider that speechlessness?

100
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,480
 Oh no, I really did like, um... I like Black Widow in Our Man 2. She was in fact the only good

101
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,240
 thing about Our Man 2. That is true. That is true. Yeah, and I like Gwyneth Paltrow in Our Man 2.

102
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,520
 She was good too. Yes. So two good characters who in fact talk to each other, which is more than we

103
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,480
 can say for Doctor Strange, where the female characters only interact with one of them's

104
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,320
 cobitos. Anyway, that's what... Bob, will we? I am literally playing with fire, so uh...

105
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,000
 Excellent. Anyway, sorry enough about that. This is why we should have a bit of time to fap about

106
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,240
 before we do whatever the thing of the week was. But clearly, um, that was all follow-up on letters

107
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,360
 because Claire mentioned the MCU. Yes, yes. Seamless it was. That was follow-up on the first

108
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,680
 letter. We have like six more letters.

109
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:50,800
 Faaar... Kay. All right, so Mark Plummer wrote in to say that he may be wrong, but it's his

110
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,600
 impression that the language shift on Plathrow might be further along than Alison thinks. Um,

111
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,520
 and he says, although he accepts the arguing for the excess definition, doesn't feel as pedantic,

112
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:09,520
 as say, insisting decimate still means one in ten. Um, and he encourages Alison to argue that

113
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,440
 fanist podcasts should be recorded on Twill Tone, and I don't know what Twill Tone is.

114
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,160
 Oh, that's quite funny. If it was recorded on Twill Tone, to be fair, it would be a fan

115
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,720
 scene, not a podcast. Twill Tone is that kind of rather fluffy paper that you print, um,

116
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,160
 duplicate onto because it takes a duplicator ink very nicely. Oh, okay.

117
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,360
 There were grot you that Twill Tone does sound like a recording technique rather than a paper stock.

118
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,960
 I assumed it was like something to do with audio, so I read it as if he was

119
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,040
 encouraging us to use wax cylinders or something. But no, fair enough. Um, he also wrote a

120
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,000
 clairehue. Um, do you want to read the clairehue, Alison, because it is about you.

121
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,080
 Alison Scott's erudition does not enslave her to tradition, but John's misuse of the word

122
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,960
 plethora will be the death of her. I liked that. I thought it was good. I'm glad that we got the

123
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,320
 poetry back this episode. He also talks a little bit about East Colin Overcon, but I suspect we

124
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,000
 will talk about both of those things later in the episode. Claire Briarley says, "Too many courgettes

125
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,800
 is any number of courgettes because she doesn't like courgettes." She says other things in her

126
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,720
 lock, um, but that was my main takeaway. Your main takeaway was courgettes because that,

127
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,400
 generally speaking, I go for like chicken ticka masala or something.

128
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:42,560
 Listener, you merely have to listen to it. I have to experience it. Liz.

129
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,840
 I am bewildered by this dislike of courgettes because I love courgettes and courgettes are

130
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,720
 actually quite hard to find in Thailand and I'm very sad that I can't eat courgettes all the time.

131
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,640
 So I would encourage people to send me courgettes, but that's clearly not going to work either. Um,

132
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,360
 I actually, I did think, oh, I could post some courgettes to listen. I realised that that was an

133
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,480
 absolutely terrible idea. No, this would be even worse than posting weeterbicks.

134
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,640
 I like courgettes. Oh, there is also a, there's a poetry and Claire also says,

135
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,600
 "Can we please have more of Liz's nature notes?" comedy bleeping included.

136
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,600
 She says she's not sure she should comment on John's bedtime tones though.

137
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,680
 The bit I personally liked in, in, in Claire's letter was the bit where she says,

138
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,840
 "I haven't been to Alison's not very big house, only the five bedroom one in in London."

139
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,800
 Yeah, I also really liked that.

140
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,040
 Taking as a man with, I would, I would characterize warehouse as a two and a half bedroom house.

141
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,960
 Um, I would, I would say that in my defence, the rooms are remarkably small for reasons

142
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,840
 and it's only, the only way you could describe my house as in a London is if you live in Croydon.

143
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:07,440
 Shots fired, Claire. Shots fired. This will become one of the great Spanish feuds.

144
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,440
 Um, because it's no idea in a London.

145
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
 Um, so she does, she does write. He writes a poet.

146
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,960
 Time for poetry corner. This isn't prose, perhaps it makes it better. At least it's all in email,

147
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,560
 not a letter. Discussing podcasts makes you rather meta, unless it's more, so let's not get courgette.

148
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,240
 Thank you, Claire. I like, I like the commitment to the A, ruraming scheme. B is for cowards.

149
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,800
 We have a letter of comment from Alison Scott in which she replies to a letter of comment from

150
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,400
 Lillian in which Lillian replies to a letter from Alison in which Alison says to Lillian that

151
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,840
 the tweet she denters didn't have anything in it. But if you click the tweet, you get a screenshot

152
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,480
 and the screenshot says that, that Zoom's going to let you select your breakout rooms.

153
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,640
 So thank you to listeners, Alison and Lillian for that.

154
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,960
 For sending us a screenshot explaining something we mentioned in the last podcast.

155
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,240
 Yeah, no, I'm.

156
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,040
 I wasn't sure. Alison is just making a face. That's very

157
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,240
 symmetric. Well, I've ventured to Alison. It's all content.

158
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,840
 Hashtag content. Yeah, I thought I was going to rant about them MCU for 25 minutes without drawing

159
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,960
 breath. You didn't like that content. You said start your own podcast.

160
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,680
 If you want to talk about the MCU. I mean, I'd subscribe. That's all I'm saying.

161
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,200
 What he actually said was that I should start a podcast where I,

162
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,280
 where Stephen and I do commentary on the MCU as we're watching the movies. But if we did that,

163
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,160
 then I would talk for two hours and five minutes and Stephen would say nothing.

164
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,480
 So it wouldn't be much of a podcast with it. Yeah, I don't know. So Mark sent us a second

165
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,520
 lot and it contains a joke. And I'm going to read the joke for your listening pleasure.

166
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,400
 A man goes up to a grieving widow at a funeral. He explains that he was an old school friend of

167
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,000
 the deceased. And if it's okay, he'd like to say a word at the funeral. The widow says, yes,

168
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,160
 that would be lovely. Thank you. So the funeral comes and the man goes up and stands in front of

169
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,680
 the assembles and says plethora. And he walks back to his seat and as he goes, the widow catches him

170
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
 on the shoulder and says, thanks, that means a lot.

171
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:30,560
 The stunned silence reflects the quality of the joke.

172
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,280
 I did laugh the first time I heard it to be fair. Oh, yes, me too. I liked it a lot.

173
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,680
 Which was not when Mark sent it, but you know, it's fine. It is very topical joke.

174
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,000
 I laughed the second time I read it when I got the joke.

175
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,240
 Well, I must admit that because of the way Mark formatted the email, it took me a couple of seconds

176
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,320
 to realize that the third paragraph of the email was not a continuation of the joke.

177
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,080
 And that forced me to go back and look more carefully for a punchline, which when I found

178
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:04,800
 out, I very much enjoyed the he also says that Steve, and I'm very sorry if I pronounced the

179
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:12,080
 surname wrong, Snaid. Snide, I think snide. Steve Snide, who was a champion of poetry in SF and

180
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,000
 fandom. He thinks he would have approved the fact that we have a poetry quarter in our podcast.

181
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:25,040
 So yes, we are continuing Spanish traditions. And then we have one. We have one further letter

182
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:32,480
 of comment in which after Claire's mention of my bedtime tones, Bridget Bradshaw writes in to say

183
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,360
 that she has been very much enjoying the multitude of sounds and bings and sexy johns with which we

184
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,920
 end the podcast. And this may be spiral a lot. So thank you very much, Bridget.

185
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,080
 I'm this is almost john fan mail. I'm not opposed.

186
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:57,440
 You really need to be able to see Alison's face. Right. Name of your sex.

187
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,160
 That did sound worryingly close to being a solicitation of sexy fan mail.

188
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:11,040
 And it seems like a terrible idea as emails to the people to write to us and ask me to say

189
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:17,840
 sexy things. I am not none of that seems un unwise to be. That seems fine.

190
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:25,120
 Okay, so I get 14 emails of that kind every day, but luckily my email program tends to

191
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,520
 filter them out without me seeing them. Well, yes, I should say I should say

192
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,200
 sexy people who actually exist rather than fake spam sexy people who I also receive multiple

193
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,680
 like it mostly Instagram and Facebook requests rather than emails. But yes, it's very straight.

194
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,400
 I assume they make money, but I don't know how don't really want to know how. Let's move on. So.

195
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:58,800
 Last episode, we talked a little bit about Eastcon and what we thought they might be doing

196
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:06,800
 in the next few months to talk about going online in the interim as is tradition when we're

197
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,280
 talking about what Eastcon might need to do in reaction to the pandemic. The government made

198
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,320
 some announcements about the pandemic that make it look even less likely that a physical Eastcon

199
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,720
 will be able to happen next year. The rule of six looks likely to extend into I think March 2021.

200
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,520
 And that's assuming that it doesn't get worse, which has not been ruled out.

201
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:38,960
 So the Eastcon did tweet to say that they are aware and are thinking about kind of the online

202
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,160
 things they're going to have to do. So it sounds to me like they are planning to go online.

203
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:52,240
 I should confess that I fermented that tweet by following our discussion. I wrote a little

204
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,400
 snip about. So, you know, if you happen to still be thinking there's going to be an Eastcon,

205
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,040
 then you should probably stop thinking that. And Vanessa suggested that I was creating

206
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,640
 tempests in teapots. She's a potster, she says the pot, which incidentally is the name of Alice

207
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,440
 and live Shakespeare troupe. They perform in a variety of tea rooms. I thought it was going to

208
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,160
 be the name of my podcast commenting in real time on every Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.

209
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:30,720
 Now there's got to be a bit of a spider-man on the sofa. I don't know. But that makes it

210
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,360
 sound like you're sitting on Fran. Okay, so this is not going in the right direction at all, John.

211
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:48,560
 No, okay. So yes, we are more reassured, or well I speak for us, I am more reassured than I was

212
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:56,160
 last week. The Eastcon is kind of actively thinking about what's going to happen in the future.

213
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,680
 I would still like to see a little bit more concrete information by I'm kind of glad that

214
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,800
 they are heading in the right directions. I'm glad to see they said something, but it is

215
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,480
 notably devoid of any concrete timescales or anything beyond we are paying attention.

216
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,560
 And I think if you're running a convention, I would hope that you are paying attention.

217
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,800
 I'm not so pessimistic as I think it will still be Rule of Six by Eastcon time, but there is a vast

218
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,520
 void between you can only have six people in one place and you can have 500 in one place,

219
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,640
 and I don't think we're going to get there by April. I should say that the Rule of Six,

220
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,840
 which is still being widely misinterpreted, does apply to private gatherings and there are all

221
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,800
 sorts of circumstances in which more than six people can gather. They just can't mingle. The problem

222
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:53,760
 with Eastcon's is that Eastcon's are for me all about the mingling. But luckily, Novicon, having

223
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,640
 anticipated this announced that they weren't going to run in physical form and they weren't

224
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,040
 planning to do anything online either back in July, which left a healthy lacuna that could be filled

225
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,600
 by somebody else. And I was wondering whether anybody knew of anything that was happening to

226
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,720
 fill that void in the Novicon weekend, John and Liz. I have to bring you up here because

227
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:24,640
 according to my quick Google, a lacuna means a cavity or depression in bone. And I just want to

228
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,760
 know in which sense July is a bone. This is an hour age, Alison. I'm going to make this into a

229
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,400
 regular feature where I use obviously wrong interpretations of the words you're using in order

230
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
 to be faux pedantic. And I think it could go down either very well or very poorly with our

231
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:48,720
 listenership. So write in. I thought that was quite funny. I have to say. Good, good. No, yes,

232
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,040
 they did. They left a... And I will help you by using a wide spread of English words as

233
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:02,320
 within somebody with a basically educated vocabulary. How? How very dare you,

234
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,200
 my lady. Would you say that you're going to use a plethora of words? No, just the right number.

235
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,560
 Boo, I want you to use too many. Um... Well, no, I certainly am going to use too many

236
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,960
 words, but not necessarily too many area type words.

237
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:28,720
 I've got to go inside because it's got dark, so... Liz is leaving. Right, sorry, I'll be back in a

238
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,120
 minute. So Liz has gone inside. She has gone from being on an excellent holiday outside in

239
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,400
 Toyland to an excellent holiday inside in Toyland, which is still a far cry from me and Alison's

240
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,600
 not holidays in Southampton and Waltham so respectively. I was going to have a staycation where we,

241
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,960
 because I am on holiday this week, where we went to exciting places for the day, but I think we've

242
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,160
 concluded that we're in fact going to have a nestcation where we sit on the sofa and catch up with the

243
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:09,280
 MCU. I am also, I am currently on leave, um, and I have been doing, well, I've been doing con running.

244
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,160
 Oh, so what convention have you been running, John? We'll get there eventually, won't we?

245
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,840
 We will, yeah. Sorry, I should have turned the video off for that bit while I wandered around,

246
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,880
 but yes, I had come inside because I forgot it gets dark. Um, yeah.

247
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,440
 Hang on, did you forget about nighttime or like, go into this a little bit more?

248
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,880
 I think Liz probably means that it gets dark on holiday where they have limited amounts of power

249
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,240
 in a fantastic rural retreat, isn't that right Liz? No, it's more that I forgot that it,

250
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,880
 when it starts to get dark, it goes dark quite quickly. Like, because we are much more in the

251
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,160
 equator, um, I always forget how quickly it gets dark basically. I'm used to this long, slow

252
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,080
 evening and actually doesn't it starts getting dark, gets dark. Also, it started raining again,

253
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,560
 which is why it was getting dark. It turns out so, so you're saying it's dark, cold and wet.

254
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,800
 I think it was cold. Oh, okay. I was just going, you could be a Waltham's stove. Come to Waltham's

255
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:17,600
 stove. Waltham's stove is great for holidays. Oh, God. Oh, dear. The sadness with which you said

256
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,080
 that, Alison. Can I ask you to take a couple of things?

257
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,840
 I did actually read a useful thing that said, essentially, the reason you're all really miserable

258
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,360
 is because you've, you're six months into this change in the way we live now. And that's a point

259
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,440
 at which humans have to go through an adjustment phase where they move from going, oh, this is a

260
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,040
 short-term thing we will get through into being a long-term thing that we have to change the way

261
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,960
 we think about things to accommodate. And you're all struggling with that at the moment. And I

262
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,080
 went, well, that makes sense. That would explain why I'm so incredibly grumpy all the time at the

263
00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:00,480
 moment. I had, um, I had the adjustment yesterday. I realized that waiting for the world to get back

264
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,160
 to normal before I decided to start wailing and cleaning and riding my bike again would mean that

265
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,480
 by the time that happened, my bike would have been fully consigned to the scrap heap. So yes,

266
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,760
 that I cleaned and oiled and rode my bike just for the purposes of making sure my bike worked.

267
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,800
 And I have set a reminder to do that every month. And that was my kind of concession to the fact that

268
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,960
 this is, this is how it is now, which, you know, is fun.

269
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,880
 "Hark to Thorp, come for the witty banter, stay for the depressing COVID talk."

270
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,520
 Yeah, so what are we doing to stay sane during the apocalypse, boys and girls?

271
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,320
 Well, I was quite enjoying the thing I was doing was to keep nearly announcing that we're

272
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,200
 running a convention and they're not quite announcing it. And I was having quite a lot of fun with that.

273
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,440
 We could probably do that, but only until the end of the podcast, right?

274
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,440
 That's the thing. We should probably at some point announce that we're announcing a convention.

275
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,000
 Are we announcing a convention, John?

276
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,760
 Yes, we're going to run a convention.

277
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,880
 Me and Liz and Alison and Steve Davis are going to run a convention called punctuation.

278
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,640
 And it is going to be the Novicon weekend, which for those who don't know is the 13th to the 15th

279
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:21,040
 of November 2020. It is going to be a GMT-friendly convention, but people from around the world are

280
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:28,080
 more than welcome to join us at the points in which GMT overlies overlaps.

281
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,600
 Which is all of them really, because I mean, we're not saying you can't

282
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,840
 get drunk and stay up all night and then have your breakfast at six o'clock in the morning.

283
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,360
 That's true. We would never say that. I feel very confident.

284
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,760
 We are saying we won't provide you with that breakfast, so you might want to make other arrangement.

285
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,640
 Yes. But yes, so this is our... So, the Eagle Eared listener may have noticed last week.

286
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,560
 That we did more than usual talking about if we ran a convention, how would we do it,

287
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,280
 as opposed to simply talking about how other people do it.

288
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,720
 And that was because we were already beginning to ruminate on this

289
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,360
 this convention we are ready, and we are now ready to announce it and let people know that

290
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,280
 it's happening and to reserve the weekend. At the time of recording, we are not ready to take

291
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,760
 payments. It's going to be a fiver. The fiver is basically to cover our costs, which are sort of

292
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,360
 not huge, but more than we'd like to do out our own pockets. Any profit we make will be split

293
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,320
 evenly between the League of Fan Funds and a charitable cause, which will probably be decided

294
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,600
 by a vote from our members. We will select some charities we like and then we'll let people

295
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:46,240
 have some input as to which one they think should benefit. Yes. So, how are you two feeling about

296
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,200
 running a convention? I'm very excited about running a convention. I think one of the big things

297
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,000
 about adapting to the world we now live is to stop saying, "Ah, when everything gets back to normal,

298
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,440
 we'll have conventions again" and start saying, "We're going to have conventions again. They're online."

299
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,240
 And there are a lot of conventions online already, but they've all been slightly not quite right

300
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,560
 for me because they have been what I think covers program-first conventions, where the idea is to

301
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,360
 have a fantastic program and what I want is to have a social first convention, where the idea is

302
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,120
 to have a fantastic bar. You'll have to bring your own beer or drink of your choice. Yes.

303
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:35,600
 So, punctuation is a social first convention. Liz, do you want to talk about it near that?

304
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:44,960
 Slightly old sex tape. So, my feeling is apparently if all my friends decided to join a convention,

305
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,160
 apparently I would join them in running a convention. No, that doesn't make sense because I heard

306
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,480
 the wrong word. Well, I mean, you know how some people said, "If all your friends jumped off a cliff,

307
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,440
 would you also jump off a cliff?" And it's basically this book for con running, which is,

308
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,120
 when I was in general, like, "Yeah, let's run a convention." I'm like, "Yeah, I guess so,"

309
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,240
 because otherwise we're going to spend all of what's up talking about this convention anyway,

310
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,120
 so I may as well help. And also because I am that person who sees a convention and I'm like,

311
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,880
 "Ooh, maybe they're doing that wrong and I can complain about it." And in this way,

312
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,280
 I don't complain about it. I actually do something about it. It's that positive enough.

313
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:25,200
 The my favorite joke, which I've seen this last two weeks is, "If all your friends jumped off a

314
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,240
 cliff, would you jump off a cliff too?" Machine learning algorithm. Yeah, yes, yes, I would jump

315
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,280
 off the cliff. Anyway, that might just be me. Apparently that wasn't funny either. I'm sorry.

316
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,440
 I quite liked it. Yeah, that's basically it. It's like, "Well, you're going to do this anyway,

317
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,280
 so I can either join in or I can watch and sideline." I thought, "Well, why not?" Yeah, no, we do. It's

318
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,320
 a small British SF convention, which means it's going to have some serious programming and some

319
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,480
 not-so-serious programming. And it is going to be more serious earlier in the day and less serious

320
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,440
 later in the day. And we are going to encourage you to do some things that are not just sitting on

321
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,640
 your arse for 48 hours at a convention. So we need to, we haven't quite worked out what those

322
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,720
 will be, but we want you to move around a bit as well so that you don't feel that you are

323
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,560
 turning into slughood whilst also attending the convention. But obviously you won't actually be

324
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,680
 meeting up because we're not allowed to do that. And we very much want all of your help to tell us

325
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,480
 what we should be doing. You can write to us, there's an email address, which will be in the

326
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,480
 show notes, but I think it's punctuationcon@gmail.com. And we have a website and we have a Facebook page

327
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,520
 and we have a Twitter page. And as I think John said, it will be a fiver. We think that's going to

328
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,320
 cover our costs. It rather depends because if 20 of you sign up, it probably won't. But if

329
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:57,440
 a thousand of you sign up, it definitely will. Yes, we're assuming that our final membership will

330
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:05,120
 be somewhere between 20 and 1000. But we haven't gotten any more detailed forecasting than that. So

331
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:12,320
 join up, tell us how much we're looking at. I mean, to be fair, our costs are relatively fixed.

332
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:20,880
 So yes, John has not run a convention before. And so he is saying things like our costs are

333
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,920
 relatively fixed. And I have run conventions before. And I am saying things like it would be on the

334
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:32,000
 whole better to underestimate the amount we need so that we have some room for error rather than

335
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,840
 over it. Sorry, I overestimate the number one. It would be better to leave some slack in the

336
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,560
 budget so that there is some space to do things because in general, you have costs you aren't

337
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,200
 expecting when you start these things like any other project. And given this is a virtual

338
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,720
 convention, anonymous, have run a virtual convention before, we may not even be able to take an

339
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,720
 accurate guess of what things we will need to pay for that we forgot we might have to pay for.

340
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,200
 The opening ceremony for the convention will occur on the evening of the Friday. I don't think

341
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,720
 we've nailed down a specific time, but I'd expect it to be six and a log or seven o'clock or

342
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,000
 or something like that. An appropriate time to get in your takeaway and crack open your first beer,

343
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,720
 that kind of thing. But there won't be any formal programming on the Friday except for the opening

344
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,640
 ceremony. It will be social spaces hanging out and establishing our hangovers for the Saturday

345
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:29,600
 program. And then Saturday will have and Sunday will have two blocks of program and two blocks of

346
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,440
 social time. So it'll be program social program social through the day. The earlier block of program

347
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,480
 will be more serious programming and the later block of program will probably tend to war

348
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,280
 silly drunken programming in the grand tradition of British conventions. We have got permission from

349
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:52,720
 the Novicon committee to use their weekend, but we are not affiliated with Novicon and we are also

350
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,120
 not affiliated with, well, Liz and I are not affiliated with Plochter and Steve and Alison are

351
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,440
 one third of Plochter respectively. It depends how you count. That's actually, I think just kind of

352
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,760
 saying, I think probably saying it's probably best not to mention Plochter really because we're

353
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,520
 kind of not saying that it's anything like it. Listen, or if you could please ignore the fact we

354
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,600
 mentioned Plochter, we would appreciate it. Oh, and Sue Mason is drawing us up. That's our other

355
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,680
 link with Plochter is that we have a fantastic logo which we will put in the show notes that is based

356
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:32,080
 on art from Sue. Yes, we will sort of put it in the show notes because we will put a link to the

357
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,000
 conventional website on the show notes and everyone will click it and they will be able to see the

358
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,560
 fantastic art of Sue Mason and it is really beautiful. Can you put chapter headings in our

359
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,440
 with actual art in our podcast, John? Because I know that some podcasts do this and you could

360
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,440
 definitely have the art in that. Well, you, not only do you know that some podcasts do it, but I

361
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,720
 think you know how a podcast does it. I think I know that we have done it. Oh, good. Do we do it

362
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,200
 every time? Whenever it's funny. Okay, so I've got this thing that I listen to podcasts rather than

363
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,960
 looking at them. I don't know if this is normal. When I look at something, I tend to think it's like

364
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:24,560
 a vlog. Well, fair enough. Or a television show or an MCU movie or something of that kind.

365
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,320
 But I do understand that some people like pictures in their podcast.

366
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:39,040
 Yes, well, it's good. So yeah, so we're going to be running it on discord and zoom. So the kind of

367
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:47,280
 the backbone of the convention and the kind of social spaces between the parties, the room parties

368
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,720
 or the zoom parties will be occurring on discord. When you pay your £5, you will be sent a link

369
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,080
 to the discord server and you can hop on and join the masses. And that will be available as a sort

370
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,960
 of text medium before the convention starts. And then when the convention starts properly,

371
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,960
 we'll really get swinging and links to the panels and stuff will be posted on the discord.

372
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,240
 And they the panels will be happening on zoom. There will be zoom parties a bit like the first

373
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,160
 Thursday meetings or the Sheffield third Sunday meetings. And so there will be zoom stuff happening.

374
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,400
 And we will also probably be experimenting with some of the other social tools we mentioned a

375
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:33,200
 little bit in our last episode. So, or maybe as the episode before, what is time?

376
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,760
 We might experiment with some of those before the convention so we can see which ones work.

377
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,080
 Yes. And if you join early, you might be invited to help us.

378
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:49,360
 If you are listening to this going, oh, I'm not sure about discord. I haven't tried discord.

379
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,720
 It's another thing to do. I think one of the things that your fiver will get you is some

380
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,320
 is some technical support to get on to discord because it's not very complicated.

381
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,960
 And I think do want everybody to join the discord if at all possible. And we're not

382
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,840
 quite sure how we're going to sort it out for people who don't. So, you know, I will also say

383
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,040
 that if you are thinking, oh, this sounds good, but I really can't afford a fiver at the moment,

384
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,600
 then just drop us an email and we will sort it out. It's a recoup of our costs. We don't want it to

385
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:26,080
 be a barrier to entry for people who really can't do that, but it just helps us cover the Zoom.

386
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:34,160
 Yeah, that we are. We are not planning to spend a lot of money implementing a financial gateway

387
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,520
 that means that people who haven't paid can't access the convention. We are planning to use the

388
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,960
 very traditional English gateway of orimate. You appear to be in the bar, but you're not on the

389
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:52,560
 list list. I've got here. Where's your fiver then? Yeah, and I think I am in general looking forward

390
00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:00,560
 to we've had we've had Liz. So Liz is as regular listeners will be aware and people who have paid

391
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,800
 attention in the previous, however many minutes of this episode will be aware. Liz is oftentimes

392
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:14,800
 in Thailand. And what this means is that when Alison and Steve and I spend an evening drinking

393
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,920
 beer and brainstorming program ideas, Liz wakes up and says, "Aha, I see that the silly program

394
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,280
 ideas have been well considered. And we are also going to have some serious ones, which is going

395
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,920
 to be good." I thought of at least two serious ones and that they'll be brilliant. So yeah,

396
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,120
 that's the Coxing Guarantee. The things I think are probably brilliant.

397
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:42,880
 Yeah, I am quite looking forward to working out what we can try that hasn't been tried before,

398
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,440
 certainly in terms of social space. We certainly got Zoom, but maybe trying to make sure Zoom is a

399
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,720
 sort of friendly and welcoming experience for everyone at our parties and social spaces. I'm not

400
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,320
 quite sure how we integrate that with Discord, but we'll have a go. I think Alison is definitely

401
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:07,040
 keen to try out some non-zoom things and see if we can find ones that work in a more organic way

402
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,160
 than sticking people in Zoom breakout rooms. But I'm also quite keen to think of ways we could do

403
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:20,160
 program, which is not just you watch five talking heads on a Zoom window and send us some, you know,

404
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:27,520
 text message questions. So if anyone has any great ideas for exciting program formats or

405
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,920
 exciting program items, they think they would like to have a go at in a virtual way. Let us know.

406
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,040
 And we're going to be thinking about it quite a lot. That's kind of what we're doing at the

407
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,480
 moment when we're not on here. We are busily running our convention 24 hours a day, seven days a week

408
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,680
 as the internet now provides. Yes, except for when I'm in the garden with my cats or playing a

409
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,640
 board game and except for when Liz is drinking coconut room on a beach. And except for when Alison

410
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,240
 is shouting at MCU movies instead of recording a podcast about them. Note that I didn't say we

411
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,720
 weren't running it in our sleep because that would be disingenuous and untrue. Honestly, what we

412
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,360
 should do is that Lillian and I should do a close rewatch of the MCU movies whilst commenting on them.

413
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,280
 Okay, and literally John, I'll only do that if you agree to edit it.

414
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,760
 No, the beautiful thing with this kind of podcast, Alison, is that you don't have to edit it.

415
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,720
 Why do you think I'm doing my arc of horror play? It takes me three seconds, but all these days,

416
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:35,120
 glorious. This episode also serves as a challenge to the hosts of the This Never Happens podcast.

417
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:41,440
 We challenge you to some sort of panel or parlour game to be played at punctuation, to be

418
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,360
 emcee'd by someone who we have not yet picked, but will certainly give us an unfair advantage.

419
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,240
 Do you dare to challenge us? This never happens. I hope they say yes, it'll be really funny.

420
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,920
 I also hope they listen to this episode. Otherwise, that's going to fall completely flat.

421
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,240
 Somebody will tell them about it. If you listen to This Never Happens,

422
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,360
 please send them a letter of comment asking if they have listened to this episode of Octa Thought.

423
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,480
 Let's properly militarise our listenership and get this going.

424
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,240
 You know what? I could actually do that before our episode comes out.

425
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:28,000
 Singers, I think so far, they're the only person who has complained to us that we didn't mention

426
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,360
 one of their letters, because at the point where we, they hadn't actually sent it to the

427
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,400
 point where we recorded the following episode. But yes, no, we think it would be good to have

428
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,120
 some sort of parlour or panel game, which is Us vs This Never Happens, and within that it could

429
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,040
 be good. So yes, hopefully we will be able to make that happen. We will see.

430
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,080
 Suggestions for appropriate games we could play are welcome. I have the excuse,

431
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,400
 so if it turns out to be an inconvenient time zone for me, I will just duck out and make some

432
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,560
 kind of stunt person place me. It will be good. It will be an appropriate selected person.

433
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,800
 Well, we got anything else to say? No, I don't think so.

434
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,160
 Yeah, it's okay. We're further along than the people planning the virtual.

435
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,320
 I'm not. Oh, God. Why do you say these things? Give me an edging noise.

436
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:29,680
 Because they're funny. I'm bleeping at Alison, bleeping it. But yes, no, it will be good.

437
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,240
 We're looking forward to it. 30th to 15th of November, be there. We hope to see you all and a lot of

438
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,120
 your friends as well and tell everyone you know. Anyway, and thanks very much again to Novacom for

439
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,920
 cancelling nice and early because we have, although it looks like we're announcing this at last

440
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,600
 minute, we have actually been working on this for a little while. We'd be thinking about it for some

441
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:59,520
 time. Yeah, so I mean, thank you to Novacom for cancelling in time. You know, thank you to Novacom

442
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,760
 for cancelling in time and saying quite clearly, we're not going to do anything on that weekend,

443
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,000
 which meant we could say, okay, this is a time where maybe a lot of people are feeling like they'd

444
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,840
 normally like a weekend of discussing science fiction and hanging out with their mates in a bar.

445
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:22,960
 And Novacom's in that sort of cold, dark bit of winter when it's not Christmas yet. And so maybe

446
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,840
 you need something to kind of get you through the darkest bit of the winter. And we could be that,

447
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:34,960
 except we won't be darvacol here. But anyway, your coke, Liz. Somehow I will cope with 30 degree

448
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,040
 temperature. It won't be quite like Novacom though. If anyone would like to come along,

452
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,200
 you'd like to see that would make punctuation feel a bit more like going to a Novacom or a

453
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,480
 plopter con or an Easter con or that kind of British convention experience, please drop us

454
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,920
 a line. We're curious to know what people have been missing from the UK convention scene. And

455
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:19,360
 yeah, we're keen to involve the community as much as we can in this style of the great fan run

456
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:25,120
 conventions. Oh, should I talk about the t-shirts? Given that Alison is involved, there will certainly

457
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,480
 be t-shirts. Yeah, there'll be a t-shirt with Al lovely logo on it. I think there'll probably be a

458
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,480
 link to that in the show notes if I get my act together by Thursday, which I might not because I'm

459
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,960
 having the week off, but you know, probably will do. Should be able to manage that. You will have to

460
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,480
 provide your own mushrooms, I'm afraid. Yeah, we could have like a breakfast workshop, couldn't we?

461
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,960
 We could just have a bring your fry up where you will, you know, bring your fry ups and we

462
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,280
 argue about whether they should include hash browns or not. It's a generational thing. Oh, we can have

463
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,240
 like, we could have like social space at breakfast where although Zoom generally is choose your own

464
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,000
 breakout rooms, we're going to say you're not allowed to have more than four of you in any of them and

465
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,840
 you have to find some knives and forks from another table and the hotel will randomly put you with

466
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:21,040
 people that might not be who you decided you wanted to have breakfast with and then you'll be able

467
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,400
 to see the next table where somebody much more interesting is having breakfast or you'll be having

468
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,160
 a hangover and you will nevertheless be having your hangover in the company of spending the

469
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,600
 unvaribly cheerful in the morning who plocks themselves down at your table and is full of beans.

470
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:43,200
 So first off that will be me because by the time everyone in the UK gets up with a hangover,

471
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,400
 I would have been awake for 6,000 drunk a load of coffee and two, can we replicate that experience

472
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,920
 of being able to see that the hotel have decided on site whether you are Spanish or not and therefore

473
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,520
 directed you to the nice breakfast buffet or the slightly shit breakfast buffet. Sorry I said

474
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,280
 shit, you can't say that can I? You can believe that. The slightly less good breakfast buffet,

475
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,360
 I mean or it's possible that some of you will be the sort of people whose breakfast is excellent

476
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:18,080
 and who will naturally be sitting down to a plate of a delicious freshly cooked full English and

477
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:25,520
 others of us will be trying to find out if we've got any cornflakes that aren't slightly moldy.

478
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:34,160
 So there is a cafe near to my house and they do fry-ups to go and for the princely sum of 12

479
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,720
 pounds you can get two fry-ups with black puddings and mushrooms and bacon and sausages and toast

480
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,520
 and hash browns and beans and tomato and it is good. Oh that sounds amazing. And on the south coast as

481
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,800
 well which is. Oh okay so in Epping Forest and I know that some of the people who listen to this

482
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:58,720
 podcast already know this, there is a hut called the log cabin that serves food and drink almost

483
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,080
 all the time. I think they might be 24 hours a day most of the time and at the point where lockdown

484
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:12,720
 happened they seamlessly switched to just eat or delivery or something like that or Uber eats

485
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:19,920
 and they will send massive baguettes full of eggs and bacon and sausage around to your house

486
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,960
 and I haven't done this but I think I'm actually going to and in fact I'm going to encourage everybody

487
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,320
 to on punctuation weekend have their breakfast delivered because I think that's very cool and it

488
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,360
 won't cost you anything like as much as going to a convention would and we can all see what

489
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:40,880
 people's breakfast that are delivered are like and that would be good. Upside to the convention

490
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,280
 basically starting about 4pm is that I will be able to go out and have a nice brunch before we start.

491
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,640
 No this is up there because I went to a convention that started 9am US time and it is kind of nice

492
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,760
 to have the morning just sort of puttering about doing chores and then settle in for a day of

493
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,320
 convention. So yeah it does it works quite well. Yeah although I'd clearly be sleeping off the

494
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:10,720
 hangover. Yeah. Yeah.

495
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,640
 Oh I'll tell you something that has happened which is the great leapfrog

496
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:28,480
 which is that Smofcon 2020 is now Smofcon 2022 and Smofcon 2021 is continuing as planned in

497
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,200
 Lisbon. Oh yeah yeah okay are you looking puzzled at me. So the idea of 2021 don't want to go later

498
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:41,600
 because they're all going to be busy running Glasgow in 2024 but 2020 can't happen. So basically

499
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:50,560
 the 2022 bids agreed to stand aside and let 2020 hop into 2022 and then 2021 don't have to move.

500
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:57,360
 So they can't just all push back a year it's got to be a hop over. Right so yes so Smofcon

501
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:04,000
 makes sense. Do we think that Smofcon in 2021 will run? Yeah I did think it was a bit of a

502
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,800
 stretch. I mean I'm kind of like how do I feel about Eastercon 2022 at this point? So Smofcon 2021

503
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:17,840
 for listeners will be running on my birthday. So December 2021 for those who don't know when I was

504
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:26,640
 born. I think this is all of this is why I feel that I kind of want to start creating the new

505
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:33,040
 world we're living in rather than anchoring after the old one. I think Smofcon might run because

506
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:39,040
 2021 we're talking about December so late 2021. It seems plausible to me that you could run a

507
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:46,400
 Smof... European Smofcon is likely to be I would say 100 to 150 people and you may not get as many

508
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,200
 North American visitors as usual but I think you might be able to have people traveling

509
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:00,400
 within Europe for smallish gatherings like that in 2021. Yeah I mean I think my gut feeling is

510
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,360
 that if things are as they are now it's unlikely to go well if things get better over the next year

511
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:13,600
 and a half then it might be more likely to work. I am I think basically for the next year I'm

512
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:20,400
 skeptical but I do think eventually. I just thought it was interesting that I thought that the way

513
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,760
 that Smofcon had handled this was starting to think through it was an alternative that wasn't

514
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,440
 just cancelling everything forever right it was saying there are other ways to do it that are not

515
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,120
 just bouncing the whole of our lives forward for a year but it was still essentially going oh well

516
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,960
 we're not going to run the convention which I thought was interesting. That was the 15th episode

517
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:52,720
 of the OctaThaw podcast and for now it's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.

518
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,720

520
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:18,960
 That makes sense John you look puzzled. Yeah I am I am that makes sense sorry I got I did that

521
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,680
 thing where I start immediately working on a thing that I decided I should work on and I should pay

522
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,760
 attention instead. Oh I see you're actually doing something else rather than paying attention to.

523
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:34,960
 Okay John that's all right. It turns out that the the iPlayer has almost no genre films on it

524
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:41,680
 except for King Kong. But King Kong is a great start. Well yeah but it is it's not it's mostly

525
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,920
 and actually there's quite a lot I would like to see because a lot of them are caper films and I

526
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,520
 do like a caper film. Will they do have night of the living dead? Anyway I will well I'll come back to

527
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:58,800
 this. Oh yeah come on John. But that all makes sense. I've never been to a smothcon and last week

528
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,840
 when Alison said something happened at smothcon she meant it. I didn't mean con runner yeah and

529
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:09,360
 con runner is kind of British smothcon. There were two I think con runners run in the run up to

530
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:17,680
 lncon 3. They've got 12 monkeys. Sorry sorry they've also got a lot of grand day out and

531
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:24,000
 volus and corona grand day out is definitely sci-fi. It is but it might not still be there it might

532
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,440
 not still be there in November so that's something this is this is a hold that thought for the moment

533
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,400
 yeah uh 12 monkeys are Netflix for me so it might be on Netflix for you so there we go. Yeah nothing's

534
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,000
 basically in general nothing is on Netflix UK that's not a Netflix origin. This podcast will end

535
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,880
 at the beep. Beep.
