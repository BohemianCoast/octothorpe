1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 That's a good point to say you all have access to chat.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,880
 We are encouraging you to write things in chat in real time.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,960
 The funnier the better.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,200
 You get points if you manage to make the panelists laugh.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,880
 - Can I pin three people at once,

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,960
 or can I only pin one person once?

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,440
 - No, I try that.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,280
 - Boo.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,960
 - Just turn it onto, it focuses on you when you're speaking,

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,040
 and I think that will have to work.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,880
 - Yes.

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,120
 - Andrew Hogg says, can I pin three people at once,

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
 title of your sex tape?

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,440
 (laughing)

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,520
 - Excellent.

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,800
 That's gonna be the title of the podcast then,

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,320
 that's sorted, that is good to get that out the way early.

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,080
 (dramatic music)

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:50,520
 - Hello everyone, welcome to episode three

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,480
 of the "Octer Thought" podcast, I'm John Coxin.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,800
 - I'm Alison Scott, and I'm Liz Bette.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 And we are here recording on Zoom on Good Friday,

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,600
 because we are not Teastacon,

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,560
 although my Zoom background is the bar at the Hilton Metropolitan,

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,840
 so I am there in spirit.

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,320
 But I only have water at the moment, I will get beer later.

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,160
 - Did we get any feedback on episode two?

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,480
 It's not been that long, hasn't it?

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,360
 - No, it turns out that if you only give people about two days,

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,320
 no one really gives you feedback.

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,960
 We got some feedback from a listener,

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,480
 oh, who was it, listener, Alison?

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,800
 Do you want to read out the feedback from listener, Alison?

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,640
 - Alison?

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,880
 - I think you should read out the feedback from,

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,440
 I just send it to you, didn't I?

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,720
 - You did send it to me, you sent me a letter,

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,120
 I'm not sure how Gordian, a Robarussian,

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,360
 a Robarussian, I could never pronounce that word.

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,680
 Alison from London writes that the person

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,760
 who does our new shiny theme music

42
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,240
 also has every different sort of graph paper imaginable.

43
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,520
 Boxes, triangles, hexagons, asymmetric logarithmic,

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,320
 knitting charts, polar, Genco Yushi, music staves,

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,400
 and many, many more.

46
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,080
 It's highly configurable and you can make it look exactly

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,040
 as you like and you can find it at

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,640
 encompetech.com/graphpaper.

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,880
 We also got a comment from listener Liz

50
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,160
 that said that when she was listening to the podcast

51
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,800
 before we released it, I asked a question of her

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,920
 in the podcast as she responded to it in real life

53
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,600
 in her flat, which was most excellent.

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,920
 We got a comment from listener Andrew who said that

55
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,480
 as he was walking up the stairs and fell over,

56
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,640
 I said careful at the very moment he had just fallen over.

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
 He accused me of being a witch

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,360
 and we had feedback from Catherine Crockett

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
 who asked us to do transcripts

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
 and we are looking into doing transcripts at this point.

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,480
 - I think I'm prepared to say we are going to do transcripts.

62
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,600
 I think Liz has followed here.

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,040
 - Yes, I felt guilty because John does all the recording

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,760
 and editing, and Alison does all the making nice doegoes

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,240
 and social media images and I so far do nothing at all,

66
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,520
 including listening to the episode in a timely fashion.

67
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,480
 So John, can we release it?

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,840
 So I volunteered to assist with transcripts.

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,640
 - I think I was lost to the accent this time.

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,120
 - I think you're putting your contributions

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,200
 in terms of your excellent opinions, which you vocalize,

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,080
 which I think is the primary thing that you bring.

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,280
 Both, but we all bring everything else is gravy on a cake

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,920
 to continue the excellent metaphors.

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,400
 How are you two dealing with the fact

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,200
 that you've got three days of nothingness stretching ahead of you?

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,240
 - I don't have three days of nothingness.

78
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,280
 I seem to have vast numbers of parties.

79
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,440
 I've had all of the fun of setting up the technical bits

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,040
 and pieces for this podcast and planning

81
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,800
 for a Zoom party tomorrow night.

82
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,960
 And oh no, but I do have a plan for this weekend,

83
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,640
 which is that I am going to take my four days

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,320
 of uninterrupted peace and quiet

85
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,440
 and I am going to get legend on pasta, maybe.

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,280
 - Excellent.

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,920
 - For the first time ever, I've been playing this game

88
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,400
 for six years.

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,320
 Hashtag not all that good.

90
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,200
 - I think it's good to have realistic goals for your weekend

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,240
 because I could say, you know, I'm going to clean my whole house

92
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,360
 and I'm going to make hot cross buns

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,000
 and I'm going to clean my laundry back.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,960
 But really, I'm not, I'm going to play PlayStation.

95
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,840
 It's also not a bank holiday weekend for me.

96
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,080
 So I just have two days stretching before me

97
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,360
 where there would have been an Easter con.

98
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
 - Fair enough.

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
 It hadn't occurred to me to try and clean the house.

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,040
 I've mostly been filling my Easter weekend up

101
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,920
 with fun things to do.

102
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,400
 And so I have assembled quite a lot of fun things.

103
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,840
 - Any flat back furniture?

104
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,400
 - Ha ha ha, no, no flat back furniture.

105
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,120
 I'm not sure whether Ikea's open, but I haven't looked.

106
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,480
 Have you guys got any virtual things happening

107
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,160
 that are instead of Easter con?

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,120
 - I don't have any virtual things instead of Easter con,

109
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,440
 but I have a virtual thing that are part of Easter con.

110
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,360
 The Easter con itself is running,

111
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,960
 as far as I know, only one actual program item.

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,800
 This is important.

113
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,720
 I'm sure you guys are all going to be interested,

114
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,080
 which is that they're running a virtual business meeting

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,960
 at 2.45 p.m.

116
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,440
 British summertime on Sunday

117
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,920
 to choose the 2021 and 2022 Easter cons

118
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,560
 and they have had bids for both of them.

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,880
 So tune in then.

120
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,920
 My guests, the details are going to be in email

121
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,480
 and on their Facebook pages, so on.

122
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,440
 I am holding a party if you know me

123
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
 and you don't already have an invite to this party,

124
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
 please get in touch and I'll sort that out.

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,000
 If you don't know me, then it was like the sort of party

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,040
 you haven't been used to con.

127
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
 So you just need to talk to somebody

128
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
 who's at the Easter con and knows me

129
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,920
 and they'll give you the Zoom code.

130
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,280
 But if we have over 100 people,

131
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,800
 we're going to have to have some kind of corridor thing

132
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
 going on or a tip jar to get the Zoom large parties extension

133
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,440
 or something like that.

134
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
 And so that's tomorrow night, late.

135
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,040
 I think there are other parties happening

136
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,880
 as several people have done virtual book launches,

137
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,680
 but I don't actually have any diary entries

138
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,120
 apart from those three, this to this and then two.

139
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,520
 - I've got your room party and I've got the Easter con

140
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
 and I've got the next session.

141
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 John Robertson did a show called Darkroom

142
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
 at the last Birmingham Easter con.

143
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,520
 And this weekend he is doing a 48 hour long darkroom session,

144
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,080
 which is on his Twitch and on his Discord server.

145
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,480
 And so that starts at 7 p.m. today.

146
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,040
 So I will be dipping in and out of that.

147
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,280
 I'm not sure I'm going to do the whole 48 hours

148
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,480
 because obviously I'm going to come to your party Allison,

149
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,840
 but I'm not going to get his sleep apparently.

150
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,440
 So that's going to be fun.

151
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,040
 - The reports of his show last time

152
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,000
 were phenomenal, I didn't get to it.

153
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,360
 And people said it was amazing.

154
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,120
 So I need to go find more about that and make it happen.

155
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,240
 Can we put a link in chat, please?

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,960
 - There will be a link in the show notes.

157
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,560
 I can indeed also put a link in the chat.

158
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,960
 - Yes, unless you're very fast with the editing,

159
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,840
 I think the 48 hour livestream might be over before then.

160
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,640
 - I could be very fast with the editing.

161
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,800
 - Yeah, that's what John's going to do this weekend.

162
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,640
 - So yeah, so I'm doing that.

163
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,960
 And also a podcast I Patreon is doing a panel tomorrow night,

164
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,160
 which is actually not strictly speaking SF know,

165
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,520
 but it is tabletop game related.

166
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,880
 It is not deliberately East con related,

167
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,080
 but it is in the same period as East con.

168
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,840
 So I'm treating it as part of my East con.

169
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,480
 So that'll be good, I hope.

170
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,880
 - It looks like we're going to cover kind of the business

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,680
 of the Easter con,

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,640
 I've actually picking some more Easter cons.

173
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,120
 And we're going to cover the social side

174
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
 by everyone having Zoom parties.

175
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
 But are there any actual sort of panel discussions

176
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,600
 that anyone has spontaneously brought into being

177
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,480
 over the weekend?

178
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,720
 What part from this one?

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 - There's us.

180
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,600
 - Yes, other than us.

181
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
 I mean, I assume the reason there are people listening

182
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
 is that we are the only available panel type discussion

183
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,720
 over the weekend and so they really have no choice.

184
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,520
 I just wondering if anything else was going on.

185
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,280
 - I'm going to suggest that this is something

186
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,960
 that people can do for themselves.

187
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,840
 Fine, three people who are interested in the same thing

188
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,320
 as you and announce that you're going to run a panel

189
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,920
 and stick it on the Facebook group

190
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,520
 and people will cover listen to it.

191
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,360
 - Yes.

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
 - I think that's a complete plan.

193
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,800
 I think start here, get people involved,

194
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,560
 tell them once they've listened to one,

195
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,680
 they should start another one and the viral spread

196
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,520
 is high enough.

197
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,040
 I understand so much more about that than I did four weeks ago.

198
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,000
 If my viral spread is high enough,

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,880
 then we will just have everyone in the world

200
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,440
 will be involved in the Easter pub panel

201
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,880
 by 6 p.m. Monday.

202
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,800
 - And I think me and you Liz are doing the game room

203
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 on Saturday afternoon, so that will be fun,

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
 but doesn't scale very well.

205
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,120
 But obviously if you miss the game room,

206
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,040
 there is table top simulator and I don't know.

207
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,640
 We were thinking about doing a panel,

208
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,440
 but I couldn't think of a good panel topic.

209
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,840
 So I ended up not pursuing that

210
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,480
 as far as I should have done perhaps,

211
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,720
 but I was thinking about trying to do something like that.

212
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,080
 And I hope other people will,

213
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,520
 but I haven't seen anything yet.

214
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,240
 If people know of anything, please post it in the chat.

215
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
 - It's interesting that the bits of the Easter con

216
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
 that we have jumped to recreate are kind of all the

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
 frivolous bits around the panels,

218
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,640
 but not the actual science fictional discussion so much.

219
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,440
 - Yes, that is a fair point.

220
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,760
 I don't think if you had asked anyone at Easter con fandom

221
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,360
 whether they thought the like one third of the people

222
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,040
 who were responsible for doing the only panel

223
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,240
 or substitution was me,

224
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,760
 they would have guessed that that was correct.

225
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,800
 But here we are, it truly is an odd time.

226
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,160
 (laughing)

227
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,200
 - For me.

228
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,840
 - You're clearly very esophanoid serious, Alison.

229
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,320
 We all know this secretly.

230
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,800
 - I'm famed for it, famed for my dedication

231
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,560
 to the art of talking about science fiction.

232
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,920
 Right, so the other thing that they did

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,560
 is that I was gonna be guest of one of this weekend,

234
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,840
 which would have been amazing.

235
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,240
 And two things happened that Caroline put together

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,520
 a thank you card for the committee,

237
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,080
 which went to them in the end with art by Sue Mason

238
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,560
 and 130 signatures quite a lot of them

239
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,360
 were actually from couples and families.

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,320
 So I thought that was pretty phenomenal.

241
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,120
 And now of course there's a long thread going,

242
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,440
 I never saw the card,

243
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,920
 which of course we'd had to virtually circulate

244
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,680
 in Starrup Tish's ways,

245
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,000
 which is one of these things that is harder than you would think.

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,960
 And then the other thing was that the,

247
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,360
 apparently they've been putting together a Facebook group

248
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,200
 for the last week, all about me,

249
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,360
 which I thought was very sweet of them.

250
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,600
 So I was quite miserable.

251
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,640
 I think when we're gonna talk about misery,

252
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,600
 I was quite miserable last night in particular.

253
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,080
 There was a point about 11 o'clock

254
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
 when I was kind of getting rid of your bed and thinking,

255
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
 I shouldn't be in bed, I should be in a bar.

256
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,560
 What I should be doing now is I should just be settling in

257
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,200
 for maybe three or four hours more of going.

258
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,640
 I should really get to bed,

259
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
 but it's the first night of the Easter card

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
 and I'm not ready to get to bed just yet

261
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,960
 because I've just seen all these people have.

262
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,280
 And at that point, it really all hit me

263
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,120
 and it was just terrible.

264
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
 So I went to bed anyway.

265
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
 And then when I got up in the morning,

266
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,960
 there was this lovely,

267
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,160
 this was full of people being nice about me,

268
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,080
 which is lovely because that's not my normal experience

269
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,920
 for fandom.

270
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,760
 I'd normally, I think,

271
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
 especially if you're con running,

272
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
 people are very appreciative,

273
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,960
 but people are also very quick to tell you

274
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,200
 about everything that you do wrong.

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,560
 So maybe we should do a little more of that.

276
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,160
 Patrick has said that took a lot of conspiring

277
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,600
 against you, Alison, don't feel paranoid.

278
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 Yeah, it was very sweet.

279
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,840
 I thank you all so much.

280
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,680
 I really agree.

281
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,800
 And I recommend being fangest of honor at an Easter card,

282
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
 even if it doesn't happen, it's awesome.

283
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,000
 Apparently.

284
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,240
 I came so close to spilling the beans about that

285
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,600
 last week on the podcast.

286
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,440
 Really?

287
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,720
 You mentioned something else,

288
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,120
 which didn't end up in the final edit.

289
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,720
 And I asked a bit, I thought,

290
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,520
 she doesn't know about the Facebook group yet,

291
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,080
 but that would have been a very germane thing

292
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,520
 to discuss at this point.

293
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,880
 But yes, I didn't want to spoil the surprise.

294
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
 (laughing)

295
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
 So you nearly spent the bean.

296
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,280
 I'm very slow on the up plate.

297
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,880
 So I would not have noticed it.

298
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,040
 You could have probably mentioned it quite thoroughly

299
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,680
 without me even noticing it.

300
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
 You could have said it on, of course,

301
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,520
 there's a Facebook group.

302
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,280
 And I could have got what Facebook group

303
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,720
 would you have corrected?

304
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
 And I'd have got, oh, well, I'm sure I'll see it.

305
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,840
 I was blindsided.

306
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,960
 I had no clue.

307
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,640
 You were all muted and I've stopped all your video

308
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,040
 so that we could do the podcast bit

309
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,600
 and then we'll have a barbit at the end.

310
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,120
 - And then we'll be drinking.

311
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,560
 And hopefully my local pub will have delivered my beer by then,

312
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,400
 but I don't know.

313
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,840
 - That would be amazing.

314
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,680
 - It would.

315
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,800
 - It would like a delivery from the green room.

316
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,960
 - Right there into the lobby of the Metropole.

317
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,680
 - Yes, indeed.

318
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,200
 I'm looking forward to it.

319
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,080
 It's gonna be a porter.

320
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,560
 I'm very excited.

321
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,440
 That's one of the very big things about doing paddles

322
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,720
 is usually that you get beer.

323
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,160
 I am bereft of beer at the moment.

324
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,200
 So this is very sad.

325
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,280
 - It's okay.

326
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,400
 I'm paying for every beer I drink this weekend

327
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
 out of the fivers I'm not spending on points of beer

328
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,120
 in the Hilton Metropole Birmingham.

329
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,560
 (laughing)

330
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,400
 That is fair.

331
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,240
 So being the fan guest of Anna doesn't come

332
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,520
 with an unlimited beer budget.

333
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,960
 - To be fair, they were going to give me a very good podium.

334
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,360
 It would have been fine were it not for the fact

335
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,960
 that I was going to use it to pay the hotel bill

336
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,800
 of my children.

337
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,080
 So how are you two coping with the whole,

338
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,360
 there's not an Easter come?

339
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,520
 - I am quite busy this weekend.

340
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 I think I am, I'm gonna miss it.

341
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,120
 Obviously it's not the same trying to do everything virtually.

342
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,280
 Anna, there are people who I won't see,

343
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,560
 who I would normally, who I will dearly miss.

344
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,640
 Obviously there is the disco and your room party

345
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,800
 which are happening on Saturday night.

346
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
 So hopefully they will address some of that.

347
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,600
 But yeah, it's weird.

348
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,080
 It's a big empty thing where there was going

349
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,920
 to be a lot of fun and drinking.

350
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,440
 I mean, obviously my bank balance is very happy about it,

351
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,560
 but I don't know, my mental health, perhaps less so.

352
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,960
 - Well, for me it's actually good

353
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,800
 because I probably wasn't going to make it in person.

354
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,760
 And last year I didn't make it in person.

355
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,560
 And what I got was lots of people sending me photos

356
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,360
 and sending me videos and sending me gossip.

357
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,920
 And it was very fun, but I was in my flat going,

358
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,120
 "Hmm, this is a bit less fun when you're not there."

359
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,280
 So for me it's actually an upgrade

360
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,360
 because I wouldn't have been able to go to the bid session

361
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,000
 at all and now I can go to the bid session.

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,720
 I wouldn't have been able to go to Alice in the room party

363
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,960
 and now I possibly can go to Alice in the room party

364
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,800
 if I get up very early in the morning

365
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,680
 or stay up very late at night in one of those things.

366
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,000
 So it's working out pretty well for me,

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,400
 but I appreciate that is a strange view on it.

368
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
 But there may be other people who weren't going to make it

369
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,120
 in person this year who now also can get

370
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,080
 these fringe benefits.

371
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,080
 - I really enjoyed OsyCon 4, is it the 2010 Worldcon

372
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,440
 was in Australia?

373
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
 - It was OsyCon 4.

374
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,080
 - Despite the fact that I wasn't there,

375
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,600
 I was in Wolfenstow and I helped flick from the newsletter.

376
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,160
 Flick was in Australia for OsyCon.

377
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,480
 And what we did is that when they went to bed

378
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,280
 I would pick up all of the outstanding news stories

379
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,880
 and write and edit an issue of the newsletter

380
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,960
 on my Mac in Wolfenstow because the newsletter system

381
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,160
 that we use, it's actually all in the cloud.

382
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,160
 The formatted newsletters isn't in the cloud,

383
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,640
 but all of the text is.

384
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,920
 And I did that and then they get up in the morning

385
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,480
 and just do the final edits and print.

386
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,040
 And we made loads of jokes about the fact

387
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,760
 that I was doing this in Britain

388
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,480
 and nobody realized that the fact that we said so repeatedly.

389
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,480
 So I did about three or four shifts on the newsletter.

390
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
 It was actually really, really good fun.

391
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,000
 It was, I felt that I was enjoying the convention much more

392
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,640
 than I would have done normally a Worldcon

393
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,480
 that I couldn't be at.

394
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,520
 And I have a very long experience of Worldcon,

395
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,920
 so I can't be at, so there we go.

396
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,560
 That was a good way to do it.

397
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,520
 If I'd had more time, I'd have suggested to persons

398
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,080
 that we do a virtual newsletter for concentric.

399
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,480
 It's probably not too late actually, but anyway,

400
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,320
 I had no promises.

401
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
 - Not too late.

402
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,920
 - I did wonder whether that would be a fan scene

403
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,800
 that came out, whether someone would do a virtual newsletter.

404
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,880
 And I was sort of tempted to do it.

405
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,360
 I sort of thought about it about 6pm yesterday.

406
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,040
 I thought I needed probably more notice

407
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,200
 than I have given myself to actually achieve anything with this

408
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,920
 because I was going to try and do a compilation

409
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,960
 of stuff that was happening.

410
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,160
 But it would be funny, especially for Conzeland,

411
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,080
 it would be fun if someone did a fan scene

412
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,480
 that was a newsletter of an increasingly less

413
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,640
 and less likely Worldcon that never actually happened.

414
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,280
 That could be a very good project, I think.

415
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,720
 Conzeland is working very hard to virtualize.

416
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
 I had Happy Hour yesterday.

417
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,360
 And Esther McCallen-Stuert had to run off

418
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,880
 because she's part of the Conzeland virtualization effort

419
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,160
 and they're having lots of really serious meetings

420
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,880
 about how you virtualize a Worldcon

421
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,480
 and what sorts of things you do.

422
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,040
 I mean, I'm well used to newsletter being very much

423
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,280
 an afterthought for these sort of things,

424
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,600
 but newsletter is the sort of thing

425
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,440
 that if I were running a large virtual convention

426
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,640
 and who knows that might happen in the future.

427
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,600
 If I were running a large virtual Worldcon,

428
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,680
 a convention, I would definitely want to have a newsletter

429
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,600
 'cause that's how people find out about.

430
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,240
 And it's how you filter the stuff

431
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,280
 so that people see what's interesting.

432
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,120
 - And it should be entirely PDFs that are left

433
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
 in random corners of the internet

434
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
 so that you can't go to a single webpage

435
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,600
 and just read them conveniently, right?

436
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,040
 That is the newsletter that we have,

437
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,160
 that we should try and replicate that where possible.

438
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,680
 - You're being very hard.

439
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,920
 For the last several years now,

440
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,680
 we have actually managed to put the thing

441
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,320
 on the website quite quickly.

442
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,120
 - I know, I know, I'm joking, I'm joking.

443
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,680
 I speak as one who edits newsletters, I speak with love.

444
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,560
 - Yes, but yes, that's certainly a thing that we do.

445
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,520
 - My newsletters have not been on the internet, Alice,

446
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,440
 and like, I have definitely bought the problem

447
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,160
 and not bought solution in this particular regard.

448
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,440
 I've done nothing.

449
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,240
 - It's really complicated because we've got to a stage

450
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,280
 in the world where people produce PDF fanzines

451
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,560
 that are meant for a fairly small group

452
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,360
 of fanzine fans to read.

453
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
 And if they do that in the wrong way,

454
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,440
 those things that are contained in them

455
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,640
 can go viral badly.

456
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,960
 Now, in general, I think we're okay with newsletters.

457
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,800
 We've kind of got the hang of what we cannot put in a newsletter,

458
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,920
 but it's only true that in the newsletter,

459
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,880
 there are jokes that do not get into the newsletter,

460
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,080
 which is just the way of the world now.

461
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,040
 And they would have gotten to a newsletter before the end.

462
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,600
 And in fact, if you can read all convention newsletters

463
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,680
 written by some very witty, witty people

464
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,200
 who would not be able to do that now

465
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,160
 in that way without getting into terrible, terrible trouble.

466
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,880
 - So I would say it may be too late

467
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,280
 for you to do a convention newsletter,

468
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,400
 but it's definitely not too late for you to do a one-off

469
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,920
 spoof convention newsletter of a convention

470
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,040
 that's not actually happening.

471
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,240
 - Yes, yes.

472
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,880
 - I will talk to the person who was going to be running

473
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,120
 a newsletter this weekend

474
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,160
 and see how they are feeling about.

475
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,200
 - Oh, hello.

476
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
 Spidey has just said that she's technically the green room.

477
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,040
 She could have bring me a gin and tonic.

478
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,440
 Now this, this is great.

479
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,640
 What you need is someone in your house

480
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,400
 who is listening to your podcast

481
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
 who will bring you alcohol.

482
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,080
 This is most excellent.

483
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,920
 - Hang on.

484
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,200
 I have no more moment.

485
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,920
 Please bring alcohol.

486
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,120
 (laughing)

487
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,320
 Listen, the Bridget has given us some feedback

488
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,200
 on episode one in chat,

489
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,400
 which is Switch Controller also sounds like a sex toy.

490
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,240
 - Wait, the green rooms arrived.

491
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,160
 Cheers, everyone.

492
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
 - I'm not sure John heard that.

493
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,440
 - I did.

494
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,280
 I did.

495
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
 I heard that the Switch Controller sounds like a sex toy.

496
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,360
 It does.

497
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,520
 I was very conflicted about whether or not

498
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,800
 to leave the end because I was like,

499
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,160
 is this the right tone?

500
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,960
 And then I decided to embrace it,

501
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,080
 make it the title of the episode.

502
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,520
 So we've made a clear commitment.

503
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,880
 - So what else did we have on the list to do today

504
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,520
 apart from talking about the fact we were not a piece to cut?

505
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,000
 - We were going to congratulate someone

506
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,480
 on the podcast, I believe.

507
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,360
 Well, I was anyway.

508
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,480
 So congratulations to Hugo nominee Coxon.

509
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,600
 - Oh, yes.

510
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,520
 That's right.

511
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,400
 - Thank you very much.

512
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,560
 - Congratulations.

513
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,360
 Being a Hugo nominee is awesome.

514
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,200
 - It is.

515
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,040
 It is.

516
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,880
 It is.

517
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,720
 It is a little pin.

518
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,560
 - How many is that now?

519
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,440
 - I have two little pins or I will have two little pins.

520
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,800
 Or I will.

521
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,400
 I have one little pin and assuming Conzeland do little pins,

522
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,480
 given that there won't be a Worldcon at all,

523
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,600
 which is up in the air, one presumes.

524
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
 'Cause shipping a bunch of little pins from New Zealand

525
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,560
 around the world might not be a good use of their resources.

526
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,400
 I don't know.

527
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,840
 - Shipping tiny pins around the world is much cheaper

528
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,840
 than shipping massive hugas around the world.

529
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,680
 - That's true.

530
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
 That's true.

531
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,720
 - So I think it's going to be fine.

532
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,760
 I think you'll get your pin.

533
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,360
 In respect, I will not win a Hugo

534
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,280
 because the raft of other finalists is incredibly strong.

535
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,560
 And although I think Journey Planet does great work

536
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,480
 and we are definitely in with the chance,

537
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,680
 we are also in a position where,

538
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,200
 if we lost one of the other finalists,

539
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,480
 that would be thoroughly deserved.

540
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,800
 But it also occurs to me that if I ever do win a Hugo,

541
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,880
 I would want it to be in a year

542
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,440
 where the Hugo was not virtue.

543
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,480
 I think I would quite like it to be a physical artifact.

544
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,480
 So hopefully they do shit massive chunks

545
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,760
 of metal around the world.

546
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
 The really interesting thing will be,

547
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,320
 given that the rockets are made in the UK,

548
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,400
 will they have the rocket shipped to New Zealand

549
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,360
 and then shipped from New Zealand around the world?

550
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,320
 Or how will that work?

551
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,240
 - I bet they will.

552
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,080
 (laughs)

553
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,160
 - I don't know.

554
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,280
 That's an interesting question.

555
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
 - They only announced the winners

556
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,960
 of the base design competition.

557
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,800
 I can't know who they are,

558
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,480
 but I think they are New Zealanders.

559
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,800
 So yes, they probably will have to ship the rockets

560
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,640
 to New Zealand, put the bases on

561
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
 and then figure out how to dismantle them

562
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,160
 and FedEx them back to you.

563
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,240
 So that's going to be fun.

564
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,360
 - That would be my guess.

565
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,600
 - Well, and actually posting the little mini rocket pins

566
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,760
 to all the nominees might be better

567
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
 than the current situation

568
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,480
 where they tend to put them in those big envelopes

569
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,800
 that you get at registration

570
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,280
 and they all get lost in the bottom.

571
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,120
 - Yes.

572
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,640
 I also hope I get a ribbon.

573
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,280
 I don't want to be done out of a Hugo finalist ribbon.

574
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,040
 So I hope they send ribbons out as well.

575
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,240
 - I've been a Hugo finalist back in the days

576
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,040
 when they call them nominees rather than finalists.

577
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,400
 I've been a Hugo nominee quite a lot of times

578
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,200
 and you would think that I would have carefully stored

579
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,800
 all my pins where I could find them,

580
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,760
 but I do have a couple.

581
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,000
 And then Madrecon did gold ones

582
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 because I think it was the 50th Worldcon

583
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,600
 or the 50th Hugo's or something.

584
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,400
 And so I have that gold pin somewhere.

585
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,240
 I did see one of the nominees saying,

586
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,040
 "I'm thrilled to be nominated."

587
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,120
 But it's so sad that I'm being in a nominated in the year

588
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,800
 when I can't be at the Worldcon.

589
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,080
 And most of the years I was nominated,

590
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,320
 I had tiny children and the Worldcon

591
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,880
 who was not in the UK.

592
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,640
 And I had years of being nominated

593
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,080
 and not being able to go to the Worldcon.

594
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,640
 And desperately wanting to go to the Worldcon.

595
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,600
 You know, I just wanted the whole Hugo nominees experience.

596
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
 But this story has had the ending

597
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,480
 because in 2005, the Worldcon was in Glasgow

598
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,960
 and plucked to won the Best Fanzine Award,

599
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,320
 which is as everyone knows, the big one.

600
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 - Yes.

601
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,600
 It's like Robert Silverberg was saying

602
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,240
 when he presented a Hugo at Com Jose, I think it was.

603
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,560
 He got the Hugo for Best Fan Writer in the retro Hugo's

604
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,840
 and he has put it as proudly as the rest of the Hugo's

605
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,640
 on his shelf because it is still a Hugo Award.

606
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,840
 But he says he strongly suspects he won it

607
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,320
 because he is a famous author,

608
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,600
 not because the fan writing he did in that year

609
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,880
 was of the highest quality in fandom,

610
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,320
 but it's still a Hugo and it still takes a proud place

611
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,680
 in his collection.

612
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,520
 So yeah, I think Fanzine is a very good one to win.

613
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,760
 I don't think I'll ever win it for Fanzine,

614
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,080
 but I live in hope that I will,

615
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,520
 but the nominees are just so, they're just so strong.

616
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,640
 They're just so good.

617
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,400
 (laughing)

618
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,840
 - So who are the Fanzine nominees this year?

619
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,160
 - The Books Bugglers, Galactic Journey, Journey Planet,

620
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,840
 Nerds of a Feather Flock Together, Quick Sip Reviews

621
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,240
 and the Rec Center.

622
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,880
 So that is a strong roster.

623
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
 - I know lots of Hugo nominees,

624
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,600
 lots of people who are Hugo nominees,

625
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
 it's really nice that so many,

626
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,280
 so many people that I know have got the relations,

627
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,360
 so that's amazing.

628
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,560
 Congratulations to all.

629
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,120
 - I think, it's the last year,

630
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,600
 Lady Business One and they are not on the ballot,

631
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,320
 so I don't know whether they declined their nomination

632
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,960
 or I don't know whether they just haven't been active enough

633
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,040
 this year to get nominations.

634
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,200
 I sort of assume it's the,

635
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,360
 I sort of assume that they've declined, but I don't know.

636
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,160
 - This is why the most exciting part of the Hugo's for me

637
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,000
 every year is the very end of the ceremony

638
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,640
 when the people who put the Hugo's together,

639
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,840
 at the very end of the thing,

640
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,480
 they produce a huge document

641
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,160
 that shows exactly what was voted for in everything,

642
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,800
 or all the nomination stage, all the finalist stage,

643
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,760
 and it is the most fascinating thing.

644
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,720
 It tells you who declined things,

645
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,040
 where you have a thing where your particular favourite

646
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,600
 missed the nomination,

647
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,520
 but missed the finalist by one vote and you go,

648
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,520
 probably should have voted, and all of that sort of thing.

649
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,480
 (laughs)

650
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,800
 - I always vote.

651
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,320
 I don't always vote in every category,

652
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,280
 'cause if I don't feel particularly well informed

653
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,560
 that I don't necessarily vote in a category,

654
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,560
 'cause I'd rather better informed people make the decision,

655
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,080
 but I do always vote in at least one category,

656
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,640
 and usually most of them.

657
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,200
 - Listen O'Neill says, "stat that,"

658
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,520
 which I wholeheartedly concur.

659
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,080
 - I mean, he said it more, "shouty,"

660
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,240
 that you just did it, which is impressive.

661
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,000
 - Sorry, listen O'Neill said, "stat, stat!"

662
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,480
 - That is what I wanted.

663
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,200
 It's a rare case where you have to tell Alison

664
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,400
 to be more "shouty."

665
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,080
 (laughs)

666
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,400
 - It's just a spot on impression.

667
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
 I mean, it's like he's in the room.

668
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,560
 - I haven't been paying enough attention

669
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,760
 to not talking to you two,

670
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,440
 and I didn't notice that it was actually hog

671
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,800
 that started the stats charm,

672
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,600
 so I expect it's supposed to be more like,

673
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,520
 "stat, stat, stat, stat, stat, stat, stat, stat, stat, stat,

674
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,080
 stat, stat, stat, stat, stat!"

675
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,920
 - Right, suspicion.

676
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,800
 - Like a statistical Mexican away.

677
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 (laughs)

678
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,840
 - Yeah, something like that.

679
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,960
 - I have just checked, and Lady Business did recute,

680
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,520
 say they would decline the nomination

681
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,720
 in fanzine before the nominations were announced,

682
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,800
 so there you go.

683
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,640
 - Excellent.

684
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,520
 I mean, excellent research on Liz's part.

685
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,360
 I have not.

686
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,800
 Don't be an excellent that they recused.

687
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,400
 - No, I still think it's a very nice,

688
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,160
 I still think it's a nice gesture when, you know,

689
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,480
 when it's say, "Okay, we've won, that was great.

690
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,600
 "Thank you, please check out everyone else."

691
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,640
 - Yeah, I think that's true.

692
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,440
 I think obviously, you know, come back to me

693
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,400
 when I've won a whole library of hughos, right?

694
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,640
 'Cause maybe I'll feel differently

695
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,400
 if I ever actually win one.

696
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,080
 But I sort of feel like if you've won three times in a row,

697
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,160
 that is about at the point where you should start thinking,

698
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,320
 is this for the best?

699
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,640
 First, fan cast winner one, three times in a row,

700
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,880
 and then recused themselves.

701
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,680
 It was at the SF Squeecast.

702
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,840
 - I don't know, but we'll look it up,

703
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,880
 and then he will drop it in seamlessly into the podcast, right?

704
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,360
 - Seamlessly, yeah, obviously.

705
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,360
 - Now, the retrohugo ballots only attracted 120 nominations,

706
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,800
 which don't seem like very many.

707
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,680
 We must be getting to the end of retrohugas.

708
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,520
 We must be running out of years

709
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,840
 for which we could award them.

710
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,160
 - So I worked this out,

711
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,200
 and there's like another six or something.

712
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,160
 We're not as close as I thought we would be.

713
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,960
 - The way you've said that makes it sound like

714
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,000
 you were hoping it would be closer, Liz.

715
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,480
 Do you want to talk about that some more?

716
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,840
 - I just, I don't know.

717
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,200
 I think maybe the first time I was like,

718
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,560
 oh, this is quite a neat idea.

719
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,880
 Well, award the hughos for you.

720
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,720
 We didn't do it.

721
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
 We'll go back and look for everything and award them.

722
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,160
 And I think it's just been kind of diminishing returns

723
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,960
 as evidenced by the number of people

724
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,760
 who actually nominate because it takes a long time

725
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
 to really go and inform yourself

726
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,480
 about the potential nominees.

727
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,360
 And I think a lot of it is not based on what they did

728
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,520
 in that year or where they were in their careers

729
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,360
 up to that point.

730
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,120
 It's based on kind of the whole of their careers

731
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,960
 as we saw it, especially for the fan awards.

732
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,160
 So I think, I don't know, we've just reached a point

733
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,680
 where maybe it's not worth carrying on to finish them off

734
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,880
 when there are only 120 people

735
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,040
 who are particularly interested in nominating.

736
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,640
 - I'm sure there are more people interested

737
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
 in nominating than that,

738
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,000
 but only 120 actually got to get it onto the balance.

739
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 I think I'm not a big fan of O, Lillian.

740
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,840
 - You're not a big fan of Lillian.

741
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,800
 Is that what you just said?

742
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,960
 'Cause that's very mean.

743
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,640
 - Welcome, Lillian.

744
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,120
 I'm enormous fan of Lillian,

745
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,320
 but I have mute Lillian and put a stop to video

746
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,120
 along with everyone else who's not up

747
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,520
 for the podcast part of this.

748
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,200
 And then in a bit, we'll have the bar part of it

749
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,360
 and they'll put it back up again.

750
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
 I'm not a very big fan of the retrohughos.

751
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,840
 I've never particularly thought they were a good thing.

752
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,560
 I don't think we need more awards than we've got.

753
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,520
 And then they have all those inherent problems

754
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,160
 that they're not quite doing what they think they're doing.

755
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,800
 On the other hand, I do know people whose parents

756
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,320
 or grandparents have been awarded retrohughos

757
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,240
 who've been absolutely thrilled by that,

758
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,720
 that that's been just the most enormous honor for them.

759
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,880
 And yeah, that's quite,

760
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,680
 I wouldn't personally have invented it.

761
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,080
 And if I were running a Worldcon,

762
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,160
 which is not a thing that's ever gonna happen,

763
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,240
 I would be in the class of people going,

764
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,160
 well, we could theoretically award retrohughos,

765
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,480
 but we're not gonna do that if at all possible.

766
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,720
 - I think it's one of those things where it's a nice idea,

767
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,520
 but it would be, it's very difficult to do it well.

768
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,640
 I think it's really nice idea to go back to the years

769
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,480
 where there were no hughos and award works hughos

770
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,760
 for the years that didn't get them.

771
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,600
 - Why?

772
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,240
 - Because I think it's cool to have a view

773
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,360
 of what Worldcon thinks the best work was

774
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,120
 in each year that Worldcon existed.

775
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,560
 Having said that, I share both of your concerns

776
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,760
 that the actual process of doing retrohughos

777
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,600
 has not in fact achieved that goal,

778
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,680
 because I think people do win,

779
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,920
 who are still active in the field for things

780
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,280
 that perhaps they weren't really the best.

781
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,840
 And I also think that I sort of feel like there is a slant here

782
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,720
 where a lot of science fiction fans

783
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,000
 and I count myself in this are completionists,

784
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,440
 and we don't like seeing an incomplete set.

785
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,360
 If you've got a set, it should be a complete set,

786
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,680
 and if you don't have a complete set,

787
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,840
 what was the point in the set?

788
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,400
 And so I think there is an element here

789
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,880
 of the completionism being the driving factor,

790
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,720
 and I'm not sure completionism is a good enough reason to do it.

791
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,640
 I would be more comfortable with it if it was a jury reward

792
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,360
 where like 10 people who are very knowledgeable

793
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,800
 go away and research and say,

794
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,960
 here are the people we think should be given the hughos,

795
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,880
 but then that doesn't really drive

796
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,120
 with the principle of the hughos being awarded

797
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,480
 by the Worldcon fandom.

798
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,040
 So I don't know, I don't know that there's a good way

799
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,800
 of getting around the problem, and so I am an R.

800
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,680
 Equally, I'm quite happy for the people who like it

801
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,600
 to keep doing it, and I don't really have to pay attention,

802
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,320
 which is usually my view on many things.

803
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,680
 So, because I was the people doing it happy,

804
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,000
 I don't really mind.

805
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,320
 That's not nearly inflammatory enough, is it?

806
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,360
 (laughs)

807
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,040
 - I tried.

808
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,880
 Kent Bloom has said,

809
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,560
 do you want to be remembered as the best fanzine except for X?

810
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,720
 - I think there are cases where you do have

811
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,200
 like the obviously finest thing of the year.

812
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,640
 There's much more happens in novels

813
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,280
 where people who have one of you novels

814
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,680
 take their jaw-dropping novel out of the hughos.

815
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,280
 But I think for fanzine, I think for example,

816
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,640
 when Plochter won, we were probably the best fanzine

817
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,760
 that wasn't answerable.

818
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,280
 And you know, A, Plochter, I think I should state now,

819
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,800
 Plochter has never been, was never the best fanzine

820
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,680
 of the year, not at any time.

821
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,520
 That's not what the hughos are not actually awarded

822
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,640
 for the best things they're awarded

823
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
 for the things that people enjoy.

824
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,720
 There's a word, there's a form of word.

825
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,120
 It's something like the things that you enjoyed

826
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,360
 the most over the year and want to see nominated

827
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,520
 or something like that.

828
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,440
 But I don't think anyone goes now,

829
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,120
 oh that award won in a year,

830
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,880
 but three fans need to remove themselves from the ballot.

831
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,800
 I don't think that's a problem,

832
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,480
 except in the case where you have something like,

833
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,080
 you know, a film or a movie or a book that looks like

834
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,360
 the thing that everyone talked about all year

835
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,280
 and then the creators took it off the ballot.

836
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,160
 That's a little bit different.

837
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,360
 Even then I don't think anyone will remember 10 years later,

838
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,920
 they would just go, oh that's what won the hugho

839
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,960
 in that year, is it?

840
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,400
 So yes, I'm very happy, very proud to have awards

841
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,440
 for the best fanzine that wasn't answerable

842
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,320
 in 2005 and 2006.

843
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,720
 - But you say answerable is the best fanzine,

844
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,920
 but certainly I laugh more at Plochter than I do answerable,

845
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,200
 but I find out a lot less actual information

846
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,240
 about upcoming events in Plochter than I do in answerable.

847
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,080
 So it really does depend on what you want.

848
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,000
 In some ways, sort of, I think you can make a coherent argument

849
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,960
 that answerable is a very, you know, in some ways,

850
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,040
 answerable is the best fanzine,

851
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,920
 and in some ways it's clearly not.

852
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,640
 And I don't know, I don't mind winning.

853
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,080
 I think the thing is, if I have a hugho,

854
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,520
 I'll be over the bloody moon

855
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,280
 and I'm not going to be worried about whether or not

856
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,120
 I want it in a year that anyone recused themselves.

857
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
 And arguably the fact that Father Them and 70 recused

858
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,600
 itself in advance means that we don't know whether

859
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,480
 it would have been nominated.

860
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,320
 Like he said he would recuse himself

861
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,120
 so people didn't nominate him, but how do you tell?

862
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,600
 I don't know, it's a very hard question,

863
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,800
 but I'll be over the moon if I ever win a hugho.

864
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,600
 So yes, that is, I think my answer.

865
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,120
 - I recommend winning a hugho.

866
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
 (laughs)

867
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,440
 I especially recommend winning a hugho

868
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,080
 to convention your app because it's the best thing.

869
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,560
 It really is, it was absolutely amazing, loved it.

870
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,360
 We'll never have to get it, but it was a lot of fun.

871
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,960
 - If anyone's been hearing rattling,

872
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,040
 I have now located my hugho pin.

873
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,920
 Zoom is very helpfully making it part of the background.

874
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,760
 (laughs)

875
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,320
 It's very difficult to actually show because it's very thin.

876
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,160
 - We can see it.

877
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,840
 - And I will put a link in the show notes.

878
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
 - You know everyone knows what this looks like.

879
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,080
 - Not everyone, Tobes doesn't pay attention.

880
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,360
 Tobes is in the audience.

881
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,560
 Hi Tobes, Tobes has confirmed that he doesn't pay attention

882
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,120
 in the chat, but that's a paradox because for him

883
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,000
 to have noticed I mentioned that he would have had

884
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,040
 to have been paying attention.

885
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,520
 So we have ourselves a logic trap on our hands.

886
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
 - Tobes pays more attention than you think.

887
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,040
 (laughs)

888
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,000
 - Next is probably audience questions

889
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,680
 'cause I'm sure everyone is very keen

890
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,840
 to know what we think about things.

891
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,480
 - While we're asking for people to write questions,

892
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,280
 we will talk about what we're doing to stay sane

893
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,120
 in the apocalypse.

894
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,800
 What do you do to stay sane in the apocalypse?

895
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,800
 - So I have still obstinately not been doing any reading.

896
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,920
 I haven't read any of my books.

897
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,680
 Since the first episode where I mentioned the book

898
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,240
 I was reading, I have been playing an awful lot of board games.

899
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,200
 I've been playing a board game,

900
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,200
 which I actually have here called Marvel Champions.

901
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,400
 It is a great game.

902
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,040
 I bought it before the apocalypse,

903
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,800
 and it turns out it's very good single player.

904
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,280
 So I've been playing that on my own.

905
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,600
 And then I've been playing a game called

906
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,720
 Arkham Horror of the Card Game with various people,

907
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,320
 including my wife, and we played some of that this morning.

908
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,520
 Playing PlayStation, watching TV,

909
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,840
 watched board knives out and watched that,

910
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,200
 and watched Rio window, the Hitchcock movie,

911
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,760
 which is really, really good.

912
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,000
 So I've been watching more movies.

913
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,280
 - Does the house your screen time been?

914
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,720
 - My screen time, I would say

915
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,400
 about the same as normal actually.

916
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,280
 I don't think it's significantly gone up.

917
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,480
 - So about 17 hours a day then.

918
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,840
 - Well, the thing is, as someone who works in an office

919
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,040
 whose job is predominantly making code go, yes,

920
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,760
 probably about that, 'cause eight hours a day for work,

921
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,240
 and then plus whatever leisure.

922
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,600
 But I'm very fortunate in that I have not been furloughed,

923
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,840
 and my work does not need me to be anywhere in particular.

924
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,760
 I think I am incredibly lucky in that regard,

925
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,240
 and it's spannier is also still full time.

926
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,800
 So we are both, I think, very lucky.

927
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,360
 I'm not really thinking of it as screen time,

928
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,640
 because I mean, it is screen time,

929
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,600
 but it's also chatting to friends time,

930
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,840
 watching people on Zoom and Teams time,

931
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,480
 sending WhatsApp messages time.

932
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,720
 I mean, so I live alone,

933
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,840
 and the furthest I've been since that same morning

934
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,480
 is to the car park to collect my groceries

935
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,760
 when I'm at a living my grocery.

936
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,880
 So if I didn't like spend my screen time chatting to people,

937
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,520
 then I literally would not have spoken

938
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,160
 to another human being for a week.

939
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,760
 So really, the screen time is what is keeping me going.

940
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,520
 But yeah, actually I'm doing okay.

941
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,080
 I don't seem to have that much free time.

942
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,920
 I'm not sure how John is fitting in board games,

943
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,760
 and TV, and video games, and books,

944
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,640
 because I seem to spend all my time now

945
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,960
 hoovering and doing the washing up.

946
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,320
 Oh, I did say I would plug,

947
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,120
 so I've been doing my daily exercises

948
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,560
 in front of the TV to YouTube videos

949
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,880
 to a channel called Team Body Projects.

950
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
 You can go and Google them,

951
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,280
 and they have a bunch of free videos on YouTube

952
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,080
 of like all levels from beginner

953
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,360
 to really quite hard work exercise,

954
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,560
 and some of them you can tailor

955
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,800
 like high impact, low impact, based on what you want to do.

956
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,680
 And they've got someone demonstrating both on screen.

957
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,640
 So that's really good.

958
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,280
 - After talking about it for about three weeks,

959
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,240
 I finally got to the point where I have my dancing mat

960
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,440
 plugged into the television.

961
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,120
 The amount of tidying up this required

962
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,040
 for the living in the living room was quite a lot,

963
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,120
 and I have got my PlayStation 2 going,

964
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,280
 and I am playing Dancing Stage Fusion,

965
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,480
 which is Dance Dance Revolution for people

966
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,440
 who don't remember the 90s and the early 2000s,

967
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,400
 and it is a game where as the music plays,

968
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,880
 you have to move your feet in time with the music.

969
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,320
 It's the best thing ever.

970
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,480
 I did this because I had been trying now for it.

971
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,360
 When Nintendo switched Ring Fit Adventure,

972
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,000
 which is a game that you're supposed to play

973
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,480
 to get you fit whilst also playing a fantasy game,

974
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,640
 came out, I decided I was buying nothing,

975
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,280
 and so I did not need this thing.

976
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,840
 At the start, at the very beginning of the apocalypse,

977
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,160
 before people had realized it was the apocalypse,

978
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,440
 I decided I would, after all,

979
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,760
 get a copy of Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure

980
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,600
 to discover it was unattainable everywhere.

981
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,000
 So this is my methadone for the new posh game,

982
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,400
 which is an old, but nevertheless excellent game

983
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,520
 that will keep you fit.

984
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,560
 And I started it yesterday,

985
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,480
 so I now have a streak of one consecutive days

986
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,360
 of hitting my Apple movement target,

987
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,520
 which is not bad, I like five targets,

988
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,760
 I don't think it's better than,

989
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,640
 'cause otherwise I've just been essentially animating myself

990
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,320
 as a slug for a fortnight.

991
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,240
 And then I finished playing this game,

992
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,080
 got some water, went down to rest,

993
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,840
 and stockinformer.com told me that Ring Fit Adventure

994
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,680
 was in stock at Amazon from.

995
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,960
 So I have a French copy of Ring Fit Adventure,

996
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,600
 a wiggy gets read to me in the near future.

997
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,200
 - I see various people in the comments

998
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,960
 are recommending Beat Saber,

999
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,000
 and as I had to go in Dublin this year, it is amazing.

1000
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,120
 And if I had like the VR headset and everything,

1001
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,400
 I would be playing that, so.

1002
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,800
 - That's a lot of money though, isn't it?

1003
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,000
 You need an actual Oculus Rift thing, or a headset.

1004
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,840
 I think you could do it on PSVR,

1005
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,520
 so you could do it for somewhere in the region of 300 to 400 pounds,

1006
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,880
 I think, but yes, they're still not

1007
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,360
 in surmountable amount of cash.

1008
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,160
 Okay, we have a lot of questions.

1009
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,680
 Patrick McMurray says that he read an article somewhere

1010
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,960
 which said, "Humanity was failing at apocalypse

1011
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,240
 on the easy level, what do you think?"

1012
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,080
 I saw an article that said that we are getting the art

1013
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,440
 of the coronavirus down to nearly one in several countries,

1014
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,200
 or at least one within errors.

1015
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,240
 So I feel pretty optimistic about our reaction

1016
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,200
 to the apocalypse, you know,

1017
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,600
 notable edge cases notwithstanding.

1018
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,320
 What do you two think?

1019
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,240
 Are we doing well?

1020
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,920
 How do we know if we're doing well?

1021
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,000
 But it's your own expert.

1022
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,760
 - I haven't been thinking of it as an apocalypse,

1023
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,040
 although maybe that's just because it is better

1024
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,200
 for my mental health not to assume I am in an apocalypse.

1025
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,560
 I don't think we're doing amazingly well,

1026
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,840
 but I don't think we're doing appallingly badly.

1027
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,440
 I think we're somewhere in the middle.

1028
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,040
 Like it's taking us a while to make the responses

1029
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,240
 that we need to make.

1030
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,040
 And I think we're reacting a bit now

1031
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,720
 rather than planning ahead for what we're gonna do next.

1032
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,240
 But we are kind of succeeding in a circumstance

1033
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,480
 that I'm not sure people had really planned for this.

1034
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,440
 Like I think people had planned for, you know,

1035
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,360
 they'd looked at SARS and take an example of SARS,

1036
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,680
 but SARS was like different in several crucial ways

1037
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,440
 from the current coronavirus.

1038
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,200
 And so, you know, maybe you couldn't quite use,

1039
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,680
 if you're taking that as an example,

1040
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,960
 maybe you would plan to do things

1041
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,200
 that wouldn't actually be effective.

1042
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,240
 But I think we're somewhere in the middle.

1043
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,440
 We're not doing appallingly.

1044
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,200
 We're not doing amazingly well.

1045
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
 There are obvious examples of places

1046
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,280
 which, you know, I just look at what they're doing

1047
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,760
 and I check my head.

1048
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,160
 And it's on a macro scale.

1049
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,800
 Like I see countries doing the wrong thing

1050
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,160
 and on sort of a micro scale,

1051
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,120
 you can see, you know, people in niche areas

1052
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,840
 coming up with the wrong conclusions

1053
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,320
 and writing bad papers and things like that.

1054
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,280
 But I think we're sort of the moment on a middle ground.

1055
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,640
 - Is that the world or the UK?

1056
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,480
 - Oh, the world mostly.

1057
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,080
 'Cause I think I'm not quite as okay with how the UK

1058
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,480
 is doing and it's hard for me to judge

1059
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,120
 because I can't go out and see what's happening there.

1060
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,000
 I can't go out and see if there are people around

1061
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,720
 or kind of get a feel for what's going on with your neighbours.

1062
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,880
 But then I guess no one can really do that anymore.

1063
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,520
 - Lillian says, do you think the pandemic

1064
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,120
 will see a resurgence of fanzines or appers?

1065
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,240
 And I would like to point out,

1066
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,960
 I think we started a podcast in reaction

1067
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,200
 at least partly to the fact

1068
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
 we were gonna have a lot more time on our hands.

1069
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,920
 And I've been editing my TAFT report.

1070
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,280
 So I think there is a more fat act happening.

1071
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,320
 - What do you do, thank you?

1072
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,080
 - We were planning the podcast well in advance

1073
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,160
 of lockdown to be fair.

1074
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,400
 It just happened that the lockdown gave us the impetus

1075
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
 to actually get on with it.

1076
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,240
 But it's been in trade for a little while.

1077
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,240
 I seem to be doing quite a lot of fat act at the moment.

1078
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,040
 But in fact, lots of things for which I like the peace

1079
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,880
 and quiet of my own normally quiet study

1080
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,240
 have been very seriously disrupted by the fact

1081
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,000
 that I now have a husband who is working for full time

1082
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,440
 in my quiet, peaceful study

1083
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,120
 and a daughter who is studying for her final term at Oxford

1084
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,840
 in the peace and quiet of my study

1085
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,560
 and a son who is playing switch games quite loudly,

1086
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,240
 very close to the peace and quiet of my study.

1087
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,840
 And it's actually very hard to get anything done at all.

1088
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,680
 - That's fair.

1089
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,200
 - I am currently coming to you from a virtual environment.

1090
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,960
 So unsuitable for doing a podcast

1091
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,400
 that I'm not ever going to remove that virtual background.

1092
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,640
 Oh, but I've bought a green screen.

1093
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,840
 - You've bought a green screen?

1094
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
 - I've bought a green screen, just a cheap one.

1095
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,480
 That is definitely something that wouldn't happen

1096
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,960
 if the apocalypse hadn't, right?

1097
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,400
 Like, I don't think Zoom and other such

1098
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,720
 conferencing tools have made green screens

1099
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,200
 look a lot more sensible than they did three weeks ago.

1100
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,560
 - When I got the Rotsaw award, it came with money.

1101
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,880
 And that was very nice.

1102
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,120
 And I've been using the money for doing

1103
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,960
 some slightly finished things.

1104
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,720
 And it struck me that seeing as I seem to be spending

1105
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,840
 a lot of my time doing fan activity online

1106
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,120
 buying of green screen was a suitable thing.

1107
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,480
 I just live in a very beige environment.

1108
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,680
 So I don't need a green screen.

1109
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,080
 My environment's very busy.

1110
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,200
 I have laundry behind me, which helps my acoustics,

1111
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,920
 but it does make green screens a lot harder

1112
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,600
 'cause it's all patterns, as you can tell

1113
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,800
 from my t-shirt choices.

1114
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,520
 So what did I ask whether the games

1115
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,280
 I was mentioning were playable online?

1116
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,480
 And I will put a link in the show notes,

1117
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,960
 but the short answer is if you get a game called

1118
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,480
 Tabletop Simulator, you can play many different

1119
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,520
 board games online.

1120
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,680
 And the two I mentioned are indeed available through that.

1121
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,160
 And Nick Upson has asked which book, film,

1122
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,440
 or other story best predicted the current situation

1123
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,960
 of behaviours, do you think?

1124
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,400
 - This is why you probably wouldn't go to us

1125
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,680
 for your serious science fictional panel, isn't it?

1126
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,440
 So I'm now thinking about this and I'm not sure.

1127
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,360
 - But Charlie Strauss did say he had a whole treatment

1128
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,640
 for a novel that was based on this thing,

1129
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,080
 but he had this idea that as we know from history,

1130
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,720
 people do pull together in difficult times

1131
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,400
 much more than science fiction

1132
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,040
 tends to predict that they will.

1133
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,640
 A couple of people have recommended them.

1134
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,000
 I have been reading "European Auto"

1135
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,840
 which somebody mentions down the thread

1136
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,720
 that does indeed it's a bulk-an-ised Europe following

1137
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,000
 pandemic, so I don't know whether that's how we're going

1138
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,840
 to end.

1139
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,000
 It feels to me like Europe's pulling together quite well

1140
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,120
 with us not in it.

1141
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,960
 Lily and I asked, should we all dress up for your party?

1142
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,400
 And I feel like you should dress as you would normally

1143
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,160
 on the Saturday night of an EasterCon.

1144
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,680
 Or not as you choose.

1145
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,240
 Just, I mean, where's something?

1146
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,600
 It's not a closed optional party.

1147
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,120
 Where's something unless you want me to stop your video?

1148
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,040
 - Needless recommended "Song for New Day"

1149
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,040
 by Sarah Pinska and "Severns" by Lingmar.

1150
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,720
 I will say that has made me think we probably should work out

1151
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,360
 which Kim Suni Robinson, three Californians,

1152
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,720
 we would like to be and see if we can get there.

1153
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,320
 - Zoe has asked, and I think this is a great question.

1154
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,680
 Are you all desperately looking for new things

1155
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,040
 to watch and read or love watching

1156
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,760
 and reading favourite old stuff?

1157
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,800
 - I am watching new stuff because I am watching Buffy,

1158
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,000
 and as Padilla is watching favourite old stuff

1159
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,600
 because she is watching Buffy.

1160
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,120
 (laughing)

1161
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,120
 And so that is how that's happening in my house.

1162
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
 Is Padilla is using this as an opportunity

1163
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,760
 to get me to watch lots of things?

1164
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,040
 But I think mostly, I hear for watch so little television

1165
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,920
 that everything is pretty much due to me,

1166
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,480
 so that's a hard question.

1167
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,560
 What about you two?

1168
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,040
 - I'm watching less television than usual

1169
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,560
 but that is because we are playing animal crossing

1170
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,440
 on the switch for almost every waking moment

1171
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,680
 because there are three of us,

1172
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,280
 and one of us is a, one of those three people

1173
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,720
 is an animal crossing completist

1174
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,000
 which is not a thing I ever realised could happen.

1175
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,640
 And the other two are animal crossing dilettantes

1176
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,480
 and keep going.

1177
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,840
 Could we just get on for 30 minutes in daytime

1178
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,760
 so we can catch the daytime fish, please?

1179
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,160
 - I think I'm doing a bit of both.

1180
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
 Like I'll read something new,

1181
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,160
 but I'm not reading anything, I guess super demanding.

1182
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,640
 I have gone back to some Terry Pratchett

1183
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,960
 because that's my comfort read.

1184
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,480
 - It's a good comfort read, very good.

1185
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,080
 - This is a statement, I think.

1186
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,920
 Next live podcast happens with everyone dancing.

1187
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,200
 (laughing)

1188
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,160
 - I mean, it won't happen with me dancing.

1189
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,440
 I'm happy for it to happen with everyone else dancing.

1190
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,520
 I will be the person not dancing in the middle.

1191
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,200
 Unless we record a podcast at the disco,

1192
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,800
 but that seems like it might be

1193
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,920
 too many podcasts in too short a tie.

1194
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,200
 Max has recommended Oculus Quest for getting Beat Saber

1195
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,560
 and Lillian asked,

1196
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,360
 "Will the pandemic rescue the VR industry

1197
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,880
 "or will no one ever want to do VR again?"

1198
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,320
 I don't have VR, so I am spectacularly badly placed

1199
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,160
 to answer that.

1200
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,240
 Do I though if you have a VR thing?

1201
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,600
 - I do not, but I understand that you can get

1202
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,080
 some sort of fancy set up for your conference room

1203
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,960
 or meeting room where you sort of get a VR

1204
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,440
 or some kind of fancy projection of the whole person.

1205
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,320
 And people were just starting to talk about this

1206
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,680
 sort of before we all went into

1207
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,560
 doing video conferences all the time

1208
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,160
 because I already did a lot of video conferences,

1209
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,880
 but now I do, only video conferences,

1210
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,440
 and I think that is gonna become a lot more popular.

1211
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,240
 I think people will realize that maybe you don't need

1212
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,680
 to do everything in person,

1213
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,880
 but maybe it'd be good if you could see

1214
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,080
 the actual kind of hologram of a person.

1215
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,400
 - I'm gonna have to find a link to this

1216
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,720
 weird hologram thing as well.

1217
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,880
 - I have only ever had the very cheap sorts of VR rigs,

1218
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,560
 which are the ones where you slot your phone

1219
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,520
 into a bunch of lenses.

1220
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,000
 What I do do is, stereo photography.

1221
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,920
 I have a phone just so that I can look at stereo photos

1222
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,360
 on it that is not made by Apple

1223
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,720
 because Apple's never putting a 3D screen on a phone.

1224
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,640
 And I have used a lot of VR headsets

1225
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,600
 in order to do 3D stuff.

1226
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,560
 You know, the stereo realist is 70 years old now, nearly,

1227
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,920
 and they're a medium format cameras

1228
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,320
 to look at stereo pictures that are just amazing.

1229
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,160
 Bridget asks, "Will everyone now want green screen

1230
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,800
 "color t-shirts with amusing hovering designs on?"

1231
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,360
 And the answer to that is no.

1232
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,200
 I also know why it's really difficult to make that happen.

1233
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,400
 But that's very boring,

1234
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,280
 and you need to ask me in a bar where,

1235
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,240
 you know, when there's not 15 people in the room,

1236
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,440
 just take me into a corner somewhere.

1237
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,040
 - So, like in the bar, we're about to have.

1238
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,960
 - Like in the bar we're about to have.

1239
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,760
 - Excellent.

1240
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,560
 - Somebody has said also Bridget,

1241
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,840
 "How can you feed your troubles

1242
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,480
 "if there's no quadraticale in the shop?"

1243
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,560
 - I wasn't gonna read that

1244
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,520
 'cause I can't pronounce that word.

1245
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,200
 - I can't pronounce that word.

1246
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,240
 I think that's funny.

1247
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,480
 - Quadraticale.

1248
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
 - Whoa!

1249
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,360
 - I can just super-impose that into Alison

1250
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,920
 and hope no one notices, it'll be fine.

1251
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,280
 - You can, that's right.

1252
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,560
 Quadraticale.

1253
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,400
 - In the shops.

1254
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,240
 - Yeah.

1255
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,760
 - And we have one final question, which is,

1256
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,480
 "Will this encourage us after this

1257
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,440
 "to travel less and save the planet?"

1258
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
 And that's from Lillian.

1259
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,200
 I don't know because the thing I'm really missing

1260
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,920
 is traveling and so I am a little bit

1261
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,760
 of the opinion that people might actually

1262
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,360
 decide to get out a bit more

1263
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,520
 after a few months of enforced isolation.

1264
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,920
 I could see her going that way.

1265
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,840
 But if the benefit to the environment is very, very clear,

1266
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,840
 as a result of the lack of travel,

1267
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,520
 it might mean that environmental lobbies

1268
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,120
 have an easier time influencing policymakers in the future.

1269
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,160
 I don't know.

1270
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,680
 I think that energy travel is gonna be very popular,

1271
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,440
 but I think some business travel,

1272
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,320
 people will start to go, you know what,

1273
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,840
 now that we've all got video conferencing set up

1274
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,040
 and we're used to it and we're all familiar with it,

1275
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,520
 we maybe didn't need to do quite so many trips in person.

1276
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,200
 I'd be up for a lot of travel rationally as well.

1277
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,800
 I'd be up for saying, no person is allowed to take

1278
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,880
 more than 10 journeys a year, sort of term.

1279
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,360
 You can buy your rationally.

1280
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,960
 - I mean, I do think like in terms of sort of conferences

1281
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,160
 and stuff, it's always struck me that a lot of the knowledge

1282
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,480
 could be acquired remotely without you to go.

1283
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,680
 The problem, I guess, is the networking

1284
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,120
 is much easier in person.

1285
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,960
 So I don't know how that's gonna go.

1286
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,840
 I don't know whether businesses will react

1287
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,040
 in one of those ways.

1288
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,760
 - My response to you, John, would be that

1289
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,200
 actually virtual conferences are a great leveler

1290
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,040
 for people who come from countries

1291
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,480
 where they can't afford to go to conferences regularly.

1292
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,080
 So they're actually good for that.

1293
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,000
 Yeah, I completely agree with that.

1294
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,680
 So that's the end of another thrilling episode of Octa Thought,

1295
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,680
 the podcast about science fiction and SF fandom.

1296
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,080
 So it's goodbye from me.

1297
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,280
 - And it's goodbye from me.

1298
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,720
 - And it's goodbye from me.

1299
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,080
 - The music used in this episode was fanfare for space

 (dramatic music)

1304
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,480
 - We should stop and then everyone can have a chat

1305
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,320
 and a drink.

1306
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,640
 - I've got a beer with my name on it,

1307
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,600
 waiting in the fridge.

1308
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,000
 - Like literally, did you write it on with a pen

1309
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,840
 and everything?

1310
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,440
 - No, I just decided I was going to drink it in my head.

1311
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,560
 - I'm gonna turn off my recording, though, John.

1312
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,400
 - What?

1313
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,000
 I'm gonna keep mine on in case I say anything

1314
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,160
 devilishly witty.

1315
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,000
 - That's a good plan.

1316
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,080
 - It seems unlikely.

1317
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,240
 - I'm gonna stop mine because I'm out of wit.
