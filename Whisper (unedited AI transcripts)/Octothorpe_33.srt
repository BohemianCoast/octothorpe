1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 So, I think that's probably the end of OctaThorpe.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,000
 Oh, what? For this week? Oh, okay. Good. Brilliant.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:27,680
 Hello everyone and welcome to OctaThorpe, a podcast for Science Fiction and Science Fiction

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,680
 fandom. This episode is coming to you on the 10th of June 2021. I'm John Coxon,

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,640
 I'm Alison Scott, and I'm Liz Batty. And our cunning plan succeeded because people wrote us

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,000
 letters of comment. They really did. In droves. His droves have secret

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,680
 negative connotations I'm unaware of. Nope. So we had a tweet of comment from Andrew who said

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,800
 that she left the BSFA at the point that trying to pay to be a member was incredibly

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,920
 complicated because she had to pay by check. And that is a good point. I do think the BSFA does

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,200
 now allow you to pay by direct debit. And in fact, they're encouraging all standing order

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,080
 members to switch to direct debit because it's easier for them. So, or maybe it's not direct

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,200
 debit, maybe it's maybe it's like PayPal debit card subscriptions or something. But anyway,

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,480
 they are moving towards a more joined up digital method.

14
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,480
 There was, as I recall, a continual problem with standing orders where people would set

15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,480
 up a standing order for a fixed price and then the BSFA would raise their memberships and people

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,640
 would completely fail to update their standing orders. And so they had this continual thing of

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
 like a handful of people who were paying at the prices from like six years ago or 10 years ago.

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,040
 So that's probably why they would like you to do it in a way that allows them to actually

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,040
 charge their full cost. Yeah. But I will say again, membership organizations where all you get for

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,720
 your membership is a bunch of paper magazines are a creation of essentially the Victorian age.

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,520
 And you don't tend to get new organizations that work that way and organizations that do work that

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,960
 way should consider whether there are other ways they could work. But we're having a panel on this

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,400
 at punctuation for Shadowy. Join early, join often. No, please don't join often because every time

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,040
 you join off and I have to write some emails and I don't like that, I have given up writing emails

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:36,000
 for Lent. Fair enough. Good to know, good to know. Duncan McGregor tweeted at us to say that he

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,320
 thinks board games podcasts may be closer to the classic SF fanzine interaction model than many

27
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,480
 fanzines and podcasts in SF. Now I have a list and I don't think this is just true of board game

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
 podcasts, Duncan, but I do think it is true because another community that does this is tech

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:02,480
 podcasts. I remember of only some tech podcasts. I remember of five discord servers and Slack servers

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,760
 involved with podcasts. So I am on two board game podcast servers and three tech podcast servers.

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,120
 I know that listener Andrew January is on a couple of servers for various Twitch streamers in which

32
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,480
 they use those to communicate with their communities. So I do think that a lot of this kind of community

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,600
 interaction is happening on discord and Slack's. And that is that is a good point and one that we

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,920
 did not cover last time. So thank you very much for your tweet. And this podcast does not have a

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,720
 discord, but it does hang out on some discord's. So you know, you can find us on discord. Come and

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,720
 join anonymous Claire. If you don't know how, just ask everyone you know called Claire until you find

37
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,840
 the right one. Anonymous Care is a discord server for people who are adjacent to British

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,680
 Fandom. So it's possible that you might not qualify if your only contact with British Fandom is

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,000
 that you listen to this podcast. But you probably do. Phil Dyson tweeted us to say on the subject

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,040
 of Canada and music Spike mentioned back in Montana overdrive. But that overlooks the finest

41
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,240
 moment yet recorded by Winnipeg's two greatest musical sons, Randy Bachmann and Neil Young. And

42
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,600
 he sent us a YouTube video. And if you go and look at his tweets, you can watch the YouTube video.

43
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,680
 And it is indeed loud. We'll put a link in the show notes. Obviously, you don't have we're not

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
 going to put a link to the tweet from which you then have to click through and get the link to the

45
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,280
 thing. If we're mentioning the the video on YouTube, we're going to put the link to the video on YouTube

46
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:44,960
 in the podcast show notes. All right, hang on. A YouTube link that Alex note on which Alison insisted.

47
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:54,000
 Done. We also got a couple of letters of kind from people who wrote in saying, thank you for

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,960
 like asking how we were. We're very well. Thank you. How are you? So Maggie and Karen Shafer wrote in

49
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,640
 and Karen talked about her jigsaw puzzles. And she says that she expects that we're not truly

50
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,200
 interested in jigsaw puzzles. But I know that Liz and Alison are both jigsaw puzzle fiends.

51
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,320
 And I do not have the patience. Oh, Alison shaking her head. But Liz

52
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,040
 loves them, Karen loves them. I don't actually do physical jigsaw. But I found that I could do

53
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,400
 online jigsaws while doing other things like for instance, recording podcasts. And I just find

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:41,360
 it very relaxing. I like jigsaws, but they're in the class of things like Filking, where if I had

55
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,320
 an infinite life expected, if somebody came along tomorrow said, congratulations, Alison,

56
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,000
 you're immortal. I find a lot more time for jigsaw puzzles in my life and and and and Filking. And

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
 quite a lot of other things actually, like I definitely learned Japanese properly this time.

58
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,640
 Karen also says, did you know that Winnipeg is famed for the Ukrainian pierogies? And, you know,

59
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,960
 I like Polish pierogies, but I have to look for Ukrainian ones now.

60
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,720
 Yes, not to mention walleye, a tasty freshwater fish. If you're lucky you did the

61
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,880
 no walleye cheeks, there are only two per fish. So, so if I go to Winnipeg, if Winnipeg wins,

62
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,520
 and I go to Winnipeg, I will definitely look out for walleye cheeks. Okay, I've also just noticed

63
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,560
 that on the picture of the jigsaw that Karen sent us, it says one piece missing. And I'm not

64
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,720
 sure I have the mental fortitude to be able to cope with that. Oh, you'd be really sad if you

65
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,040
 did the whole thing. And then there was one piece left over. Yeah, I'm sorry, one piece missing.

66
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,920
 If you do a whole, I mean, one of the things you could do if you're a bad human being is to

67
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,880
 take a jigsaw and then put one extra piece into every jigsaw in your local charity shop.

68
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,040
 Because I think finishing a jigsaw or discovering you've got a piece left over would be

69
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,200
 awesome. It's not the way it normally works. As somebody who's a connoisseur of electronic

70
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,920
 jigsaw list, you won't have this experience. Electronic jigsaw, you don't tend to get to the

71
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,320
 end and discover there's a piece missing. Now you do, because in the platform I use for electronic

72
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,840
 jigsaw, sometimes you find that one piece has kind of got hidden under all the other pieces.

73
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,760
 And then you can't find it. But it also lets you finish the jigsaw with one or two pieces missing

74
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,160
 on the assumption you might have done this by accident. I'm not sure whether to applaud the

75
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,840
 platform for having faithfully recreated the experience of a physical jigsaw or to wonder

76
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,240
 why they have chosen to recreate this specific part of physical jigsaw. Yeah, so do they also

77
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,840
 recreate the status of crushing on we that comes from spending six weeks working on the 2000

78
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,360
 piece jigsaw and they're discovering there was a piece missing. Crushing on we is definitely the

79
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,600
 name of my next contemplative funk album. I don't mind missing pieces in jigsaw so maybe this just...

80
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,920
 Liz! Yeah, I'm just in a completely different zone in the rest of you. Stop boasting about your

81
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,840
 excellent mental health. Octa thought the podcast of science fiction and science fiction fandom

82
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,960
 at jigsaw's IQ analysis. Why love about this is sometimes when we have letters of comment and we

83
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,480
 have topics in the show notes I can predict where those topics will end up. In this case I would

84
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,320
 not have predicted like just my or Liz's robust mental health like being the pointer which we

85
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,040
 wrapped up discussion of Karen's letter that is most excellent and this is why we need more

86
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,800
 layers of comment. I don't know if this was a sign of excellent mental health I will you know if I don't

87
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,440
 know where I'm going with this. It certainly seems very very balanced and sensible. Yeah.

88
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,680
 Oh yeah I can finish jigsaw there's a couple of bits missing and I don't get upset about that.

89
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,200
 That is not my personal experience. Oh I see okay okay. Oh no. Oh no. I've luckily

90
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:03,440
 have given up anger. Listeners writing and tellers which one of us is um which which side you are

91
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,960
 on in this debate. If you could write in and tell us the integer number of pieces that you are

92
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,400
 comfortable being missing from a jigsaw I will draw a graph of octa thought listeners

93
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,960
 against number of pieces missing. Me and Alison are zero Liz what's your number?

94
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,720
 Well it's not an integer it's probably a fraction it's probably like a proportion of

95
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,080
 missingness of the jigsaw isn't it? Oh shoot good point what's your fact what's your percentage

96
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,040
 missing? I don't know I let you know when I've got like 95% of this jigsaw done and see if I'm annoyed.

97
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:41,120
 So as I said I think having zero or one pieces missing would be quite zero is fine one piece

98
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,480
 missing is quite distressing finishing a jigsaw and discovering that you had minus three pieces

99
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,320
 missing or 2.6 pieces missing or i pieces missing would be really quite

100
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,040
 discombobulating. All right if I discovered I had i pieces missing from a jigsaw I would be

101
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,800
 discombobulated because I think that's the sign that physics has gone wrong and the elder ones

102
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:11,360
 are invading so yeah Maggie also wrote to us saying um that she liked that um she liked that we did

103
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,280
 a little discussion corner for this last episode she can look up jargon but it can be hard to look

104
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,880
 up why things are considered important particularly for local fandoms and she asks this is her first

105
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,360
 world con and there seems to be a lot of internal politics becoming visible is this typical or is

106
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,400
 it just a silly question and I do wonder whether uh I think it's a function it's it's fractal

107
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,560
 there's more internal politics the harder you look much like a coastline but also there's more

108
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,040
 politics so some of it is internal but some of it is caused by the world con is coming under

109
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,280
 greater pressure than it used to because it's becoming more global which means it's representing

110
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:00,480
 more different communities and the hugos in particular are much higher profile than they were I think

111
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,320
 even ten years ago but certainly than 20 or 30 years ago and that has really changed the the

112
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,680
 whole dynamic of the politics of the world con um that gets me a chance to tick off something

113
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,160
 that's further down the um list which is the hugo verter packet is finished I mean my bits are

114
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,960
 sort of finished and I'm very pleased about that and it should be with you in a week or so let's

115
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,280
 not make any I think there's an official line which is it is in preparation and we will let

116
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,520
 you know when it's done okay excellent stuff well done Alison for doing that good good good

117
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,680
 she also says I'm looking forward to hearing Alison's take on someone being a professional

118
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,720
 enthusiast so if we get to um the phrase rampant self-promotion later in this episode you'll get to

119
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,880
 hear DC congratulates Alison on her guest of honor thing that is the week after punctuation so it'll

120
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,320
 be just after the next episode and I'll plug it together it is called conspire and it is the annual

121
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,880
 general meeting of the British Science Fiction Association and the Science Fiction Foundation

122
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,640
 and they also have guests giving talks and there's a panel and um the other two guests are

123
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:17,040
 Tarda Thompson and John Clute um so that all sounds very good to me it'll be a good day and it's free

124
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,000
 come along that is pretty good company to be in yeah no I don't know why they've invited me I

125
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,360
 know I'm not like yeah god so we've got also a couple of things talking about fanzines which

126
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,480
 we're going to use to seamlessly segue into our first topic so um Peter Sullivan sent us a tweet

127
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,920
 saying that my point about lack of innovation in PDF fans is fair and notes that at one point

128
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,000
 it looked as if high frequency was going to be the new innovation with zines like Vegas fandom weekly

129
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,680
 the drink tank and science fiction San Francisco um my wife is fanya was one of the editors of

130
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:59,360
 sfsf when it was a going concern um and the drink tank is chris carseers uh fanzine which went away

131
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,600
 and then came back again there's I can't remember how many issues there's been at least 400 but

132
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,480
 many many issues and yeah that's a good point there was there was a point of which it looked like

133
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,400
 uh high frequency was going to be the new innovation uh I think that has mostly gone away in favor of

134
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,640
 I think high frequency is still an innovation I just don't think the people doing high frequency

135
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,000
 fan writing and doing it in PDFs anymore like far 770 I met someone who insisted that every single

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,800
 blog post was an issue and on that metric far 770 has published many issues now um I'm not sure

137
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,840
 whether mike glyer thinks every blog post is an issue so we could ask him mike give you a listening

138
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,280
 get in touch i'm not sure mike glyer has a radio it's not going to get podcasts on the radio

139
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:51,120
 uh so chris carseer wrote in saying that he's a fanzine nerd no really and he said that jenny

140
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,440
 planet doesn't get many letters um but uh they just don't get letters or many mentions on social

141
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,080
 media and he says it's weird that apparently nominating us for hugos is how most readers interact

142
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:11,840
 with us which is uh well good stuff chris thank you very much and he notes that um he thinks you

143
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,640
 can tell where podcasts come out of fanzine tradition because of the interaction with the

144
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,960
 audience which is something we mentioned uh with duncan's tweet earlier but it's a good point

145
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:26,880
 mark plumber says that he is cheered to hear um him and claire described by drona's more innovative

146
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:36,160
 um and talks about the early electronic fanzines um which i think um uh allison has

147
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:44,320
 things she wants to say about i just picked up one tiny little point from this which was when you

148
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,320
 say that freq high frequency is an innovation or was looking to be the innovation for some time

149
00:14:50,320 --> 00:15:00,080
 and the term electronic email fanzines started in the mid 90s um when i got online which was 1993

150
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:08,480
 the fanzine done by evland and mark leper the empty void had already been around and online for a

151
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,400
 very very long time and it was in fact in the form of usenet post i mean it was also a mailing list so

152
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,760
 you could get it by email or you could get it posted to usenet um usenet was kind of like

153
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:26,400
 discord for the past framp framp readers listeners whatever um and that was weekly so that was a

154
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,400
 weekly fanzine they're still doing and this is the amazing thing because they are still doing it

155
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,320
 they have been doing it for over 40 years um it now contains things like update on evland's hip

156
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,000
 which you know is i think one of the things that happens to people after they've been doing

157
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,160
 fancies for more than 40 years every single week um but it's there it's um and i think the fanzine

158
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:56,080
 and maybe both mark and evland separately either have hugos or at least have been nominated for hugos

159
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,000
 this work but yeah so it's not it's kind of a very all all the ideas are new again

160
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,160
 it comes round and round but it was all it was always electronic i mean i'm sure you it was

161
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,640
 possible to get it on paper if you were in the right place and certainly i know people who get it

162
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,920
 probably still get it religiously every week and print it out because you know

163
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,160
 but it's there uh we will put a link to it in the show notes because you could go and read it online

164
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,840
 it's online he notes that and i went to print only until 2012 when there was a huge

165
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:33,200
 hike in international postage and um mark and claire started doing e-pubs then when people had

166
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,040
 e-readers and him and claire both got e-readers and he says he's not aware of anyone else doing

167
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,840
 uh an e-pub fanzine before they did it in august 2012 so i immediately sent him a link to a copy

168
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,200
 of my fanzine procrastinations which was an e-pub in 2011 uh because i think i was the first i'm

169
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,080
 happy to be proven wrong but i it's certainly in like the fanzine circles i was running in

170
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:06,240
 it was something i wanted to uh because i was having this rant 10 years ago and the fact that

171
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,720
 the rant still exists in almost exactly the same form uh says a lot i think but yes i do think

172
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,520
 you know e-pubs are good more people should do e-pubs don were you sending your e-pubs directly

173
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,880
 to people's kindles because i think that is uh an area where i really enjoy that just sometimes

174
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,400
 i open my kindle and update everything is on it and a new banana wings pops up it's great so uh

175
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,480
 no i would let people download them the old-fashioned way mainly because um i don't have a kindle

176
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,760
 yeah i'm not sure if you could i mean i'm not even sure if you could send stuff in in 2011 you

177
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,280
 definitely could buy 2012 because that's how i get to my banana wings fix and obviously you lock

178
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,760
 religiously liz no i'm a terrible person who's very bad at sending locks yes so john foister

179
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:02,400
 did sent text emails as fanzines that he designed to be read in um landscape because he thought

180
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,280
 that most people would be reading them on their computers and that that he is still the case that

181
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,680
 quite a lot of stuff you see coming in in electronic fanzine form is nevertheless clearly designed to

182
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,520
 be written to be read as as a full pages and now i quite like reading things that are formatted

183
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,880
 for a full pages on my iPad but i know that lots of people don't so yeah mark mentions that in a kind

184
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,040
 of you know at one point if you were writing if you're making a pdf your fanzine everyone would

185
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:36,480
 be reading it on a computer monitor but now actually pdfs work much more uh work much more nicely on

186
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,240
 tablets and quite a lot of people have tablets it's also possible you know with with my phone being

187
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,120
 basically a giant thing now with high resolution that i could also read pdfs quite nicely on my

188
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:56,640
 phone how big how big is your phone liz um i mean this doesn't really work on on camera on a podcast

189
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,200
 does it but it's this big Alison jesus uh for the listener i think it's roughly

190
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,320
 imagine liz was happy was holding up a sort of averagely sized chopping board and then just add

191
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
 a little bit round the edges and that's how big liz's phone is yeah it's probably

192
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,120
 signed that you should not buy phones uh sight unseen uh on the internet um unless you want a big one

193
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,080
 which is actually not true for other things that you buy on the seed site on seed on the internet

194
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,280
 when they tend to turn up quite small i have google it and it is uh 163 millimeters buying

195
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,000
 76 millimeters so it's quite hefty no and i think i think you are probably right that uh pdfs work

196
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,080
 better on um on phone screens than they did 10 years ago uh because obviously phones have gotten

197
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:54,480
 bigger and the resolutions have gotten better um i'm going to try loading a randomly selected

198
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:03,440
 phanzine on my phone and it's loading uh so this is 0.1 against pdfs much bigger than e-bubs and so

199
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:11,280
 it's still loading i might just keep all of this silence in i'm not gonna try this

200
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:19,680
 this live phanzine demo the other thing is obviously that you you can't um you can't do things

201
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,360
 like if you are um if your eyesight is not very good you can't do things like um adjust the tech

202
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,280
 size um in in terms of kind of like doing it automatically with like set of accessibility

203
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,520
 features and there's just there's a bunch of little things that make it worse when you can't

204
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,240
 assume what someone's reading it on um and i do think in general i'm much more likely to read e-bubs

205
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,600
 on my phone just because they have so many little kind of kind of features like that just before we

206
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,920
 move on to something else my other thing i will say on phanzine delivery mechanisms is that if you

207
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:03,760
 have the RSS reader feed bin which you can subscribe to at feedbin.com you can have it um

208
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:11,680
 convert emails into things you read in RSS reader and so i subscribe to transfer orbits and

209
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:19,520
 another phanzine uh in my RSS reader and i enjoy that very much um we should probably say that feed

210
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,480
 bin is a paid service um i love it three dollars a month something like that yeah five i don't

211
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,640
 it's fine it's not it's not huge john how are you going to handle art in your pursine because that's

212
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,640
 what i wonder about with sort of e-pubs is they're not really as great for art i mean you can't do

213
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,400
 stuff like having the art in the corner and having the text flow around it like you would in a in a

214
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:53,040
 physical artifact but you can do like you can kind of put images in e-pubs like without much trouble

215
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,680
 so i don't know whether i don't think it's a problem to have a picture in an e-pub it might be a

216
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,200
 problem to have like art uh text flow around it as opposed to having text then image then text um

217
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,280
 but i don't know i don't necessarily think that's a big problem i am now holding up my iPad

218
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,880
 because art's lovely eyes lovely in i for all i pads i mean it just you get even bigger i pads

219
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,000
 than this i believe mark also mentions in his letter the fact that putting together all the

220
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,360
 different versions that they do for banana wings is drudge work and this was quite resonant for me

221
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,960
 because i've just been doing this work on the hugo voter packet and the thing about the hugo

222
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,320
 voter packet is they're not actually more work than a lot of other tasks involved in putting a big

223
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,280
 convention together but it feels more a lot of it feels more drudge like and i think that thing

224
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,760
 about converting formats and getting things in the right place and making sure that everything is

225
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:58,880
 reasonably consistent is is very thankless work that has as mark says it feels like work and and

226
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,600
 we tend to like afanak to feel like not work to feel like things that are fun even if they are

227
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,280
 actually taking quite a lot of time and evolve quite a lot of background work so i thought that

228
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,520
 was an interesting point i think for me doing the layout work also feels like work layouts

229
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:23,360
 fun bit i mean it can be but no doing the layout in wordpress is obviously extremely painful so

230
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,840
 yeah there's that but also like doing stuff like the layout of my taff report which was like a hundred

231
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,760
 pages in in design it that very much feels like work whereas doing like a little newsletter in

232
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,720
 east conning in pages feels fun and like you just get to like spend two hours mucking about and then

233
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,600
 publish it um so i do think there is a the i think the thing that i find doesn't feel like work

234
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,840
 is splitting these things into small chunks that are regular which is one of the reasons why we do

235
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,560
 a regular sub one hour podcast rather than an irregular marathon which i know some podcasts

236
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,560
 especially in the fanish space do but the other reason are like we've transitioned lulzine to

237
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,400
 basically being an article a month and that feels much more fun than having it come out

238
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,040
 four times less frequently but with four times more articles which and i don't know because

239
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,560
 it's the same amount of work but it definitely one feels way more like work than the other and

240
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,560
 for me it's that regularity and size of work that that i think but i think you're right that um

241
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,520
 it's all about finding the ways in which you have fun while you're doing the fanak because you

242
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,480
 don't want it to feel like work um so far as you can make it not feel like work i'd say that you know

243
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,080
 a lot of the work i do for conventions and things is quite boring grunt work or at least a lot of

244
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,560
 it can be like if you're putting together a program there are some fun bits which are deciding what

245
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,760
 you should do and who should go on them and then you also have to send and reply to like

246
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,720
 six thousand emails and um you know put things into a schedule and move them about and it's

247
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,920
 basically sitting in front of a computer doing a lot of stuff which feels a lot like what you do

248
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,840
 in an office job in front of a computer anyway yeah so that programming was one of the other

249
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,000
 tasks because i thought probably felt quite a bit like this yeah i don't find i mean i don't find

250
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,600
 it super tedious but maybe because i do slightly different things on a day to day basis and i guess

251
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,920
 i found i find the outcome quite satisfying satisfying enough that i don't mind basically

252
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,720
 sitting in front of my laptop a lot of the time moving program items about and seeing if one of

253
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,200
 them turns red yeah that makes sense um i think fanak for me in terms of con running con running

254
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,840
 is way more fun when i'm doing the con running while drinking a beer with other people on zoom

255
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,040
 than it is when i'm sitting on my own not drinking a beer doing the con running and so i think that's

256
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,400
 the other thing like for me the way we've been doing a lot of the punctuation work is that we will

257
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,240
 just have evenings where we're not really necessary to each other in terms of like having actions that

258
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,440
 rely on one another but we can hang out and like just natter like a virtual office i think what

259
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,760
 we're discovering here listeners is that talking to people and personal interactions are important

260
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,920
 and good and i think that is a revelation and we should probably publicize in some sort of

261
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,800
 psychology journal and liz as chief mental health haver should be the lead author

262
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,400
 it's really interesting actually because there are some sorts of work i quite like some sorts of

263
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,280
 fiddly tedious work and that i'd include quite a lot of photo choppy stuff and also the air table

264
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:38,240
 air table is the back end database that um that punctuation is using um that sort of stuff i really

265
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,560
 like to do on my own with only electronic music or other people's podcasts for company and then

266
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,720
 there's other stuff like um i don't know you know i think i've got a long list of things that i might

267
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,680
 do tonight like like i spy at punctuation that's obviously going to be much more if it happens

268
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:03,120
 it'll be much more fun done during our drunk connections evening tonight and i think for me the things

269
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,280
 that i find super fun even though i know lots of other people find quite drudgworky are programming

270
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,680
 computer programming find that enormously fun i can get sucked into that for hours and the other

271
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:22,880
 one is tidying up i can tidy up i love tidying up listeners john please come to my house i have

272
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,840
 occasionally tidied things up where people have been annoyed at me for instance because i apply

273
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,440
 my tidying up in both the digital and and physical realms and i have learned things about the the

274
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,200
 apt times to do that and when i should absolutely on no account be doing that stop it john stop it

275
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,960
 why are you still doing that uh see also john and allison had a row which i think we're actually

276
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,120
 taking as a topic for next time because i we had a row about something totally different but

277
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,480
 the reason we had that row was that i was still really angry about john messing with my air table

278
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,440
 in real time the previous day so that was a complete fail in terms of human being interaction thing

279
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,680
 don't tidy things up when people are using them that that that is a point of reflection for john

280
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:15,840
 for sure yeah as i got a bit older i would find that sometimes instead of having parties where

281
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,960
 you've come down in the morning and find that your house was full of like seven to a dozen empty beer

282
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,000
 glasses and you know half sliced lemons that got left on the counter people were actually

283
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,960
 spontaneously tidying up the kitchen for us at the parties and this i think was the best thing ever

284
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,880
 i've done that new year's day in 2012 i crashed from my friend tony at his new year's party and he

285
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,760
 got down in the morning to find that i had put everything in the bin and minced everything out

286
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,200
 and etc and he was like what has happened and i was like i was bored i like tidying

287
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,280
 though when we went to america in 2003 so it was quite a long time ago my kids were quite little

288
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:04,640
 we were staying with jerry in minneapolis and we woke up in the way of people who have just flown from

289
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,560
 from the uk the following morning at about half past three and we went downstairs to discover that

290
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,720
 jerry had left out for us some breakfast or some suggestions as to how we might acquire breakfast

291
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,000
 at three o'clock in the morning three thirty in the morning and also a parl of 400 fancies that needed

292
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,680
 to be collated and stegtled in a sort of i assume that when you wake up you'll want something to

293
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:35,600
 keep me busy until eight so yes also for people who find that people are tidying up at their

294
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,200
 put after their parties welcome to middle age this is the sort of thing that old people do

295
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,400
 young people aren't hap nicely tidying up at the end of the parties because they were at two

296
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,280
 pissed and they were doing inappropriate things and they didn't particularly want to deal with

297
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,720
 friends for it anyway i mean i will just say that the story i just told about when i was tidying up i

298
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:05,360
 was 22 you were wise beyond your years young coxern i just f*cking love tidying up alison

299
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,960
 you don't understand it's a seriously come round i mean come round it's fine yeah john come and

300
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:19,840
 visit come and visit i can see some clutter in both of my co-hosts um zoom calls i literally think

301
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,040
 there's no clutter in this picture there is one open cup of door oh there is the

302
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,800
 eight-coloured store it's because it's clean as this doesn't shut on the floor it's an adorable

303
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,880
 shot but a possible open cup of pool there is no so i can indirectly observe the effects of clutter

304
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,880
 yes but you can't actually see it directly like indeed a black hole which is what steven's

305
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,320
 side of the room is like to some extent let's stop talking about your husband's black hole

306
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:55,760
 and move on to discussing tor con uh 2021 which when you listen to this listener if you are listening

307
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:04,400
 on the day it comes out it's today at uh seven p.m eastern time which is midnight in god's true

308
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,480
 time zone of england as you know to be fair england's not currently on god's true time zone

309
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,120
 because everyone knows that jesus was born in quenich uh there are some panels and whatnots

310
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,000
 there are apparently giveaways content drops and more we will put a link in the show notes

311
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,840
 there are various authory people and it will be very fun if you like that sort of thing i don't

312
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,240
 think it has any of i don't think it has any elephant friendly content by which i mean insufficient

313
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,680
 beer parties hangouts even a bit of chat to your author no it's panels and stuff it's would you like

314
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,080
 to watch some television about science fiction authors yeah but it's a good set of science fiction

315
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,760
 also think oh yeah no no it's fine it's it's i'm sure it's great but i it's not what you think of

316
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,040
 as a convention it's it's some television with authors on it's not what cat yeah i'm gonna say i

317
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:03,440
 don't think that events that author a series of author events over a weekend makeeth a convention

318
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,320
 i i think that i require some interaction between the attendees for it to be a convention in my books

319
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,600
 what does make it a weekend convention for our lesson then what was that so i was trying to

320
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,440
 badly segue into punctuation oh you're segue into telling and talking about our convention yes

321
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,560
 punctuation will not have insufficient beer it will have sufficient beer in that we have a beer

322
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:36,000
 tasting and you can order your beers listeners we also have a gin tasting and a cheese tasting

323
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,160
 so order all of the food and drink and if you've had a birthday since the beginning of the pandemic

324
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:48,320
 we are having a birthday party um to celebrate all of those birthdays we are particularly celebrating

325
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,040
 people who've had milestone birthdays but in my book every birthday is a milestone birthday

326
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,240
 so we're having a birthday party so you might want to make sure you've got some cake

327
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,760
 if you have not had a birthday since the start of the pandemic please also write on tellers

328
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,200
 because i think that's one of those are the signs that physics has gone badly wrong

329
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:14,480
 leap babies they won't have had a birthday oh leap babies yes yes we will have a party just for

330
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,360
 the beer babies also so if you are one right in so if you were born on the 29th of February and you

331
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,800
 had it and you celebrated your birthday on the 29th of February 2020 because you had not noticed

332
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,520
 that the pandemic was on the way that a birthday party was not the perfect idea um but it's just

333
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,560
 fair enough quite early i was still meeting people in person for another week after that

334
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,560
 then death is congratulations you've not missed out on any of your birthday parties i think

335
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:46,160
 don't people whose birthday is the 29th of February actually celebrate a birthday every year

336
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,040
 anyway i think i'm pretty sure it's illegal to celebrate your birthday on a day there's not

337
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,640
 your birthday so i hope not moving on it better not be because we're definitely celebrating everyone's

338
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,320
 birthdays but they weren't at the birthdays party at punctuation

339
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:14,560
 all members of worldcon 76 got an email this week informing them that sfsfc the parent body

340
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,360
 which ran worldcon 76 have settled the ongoing lawsuit over the public statements surrounding that

341
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:28,880
 the preemptive banning of an attendee from the event according to the discussion on file 770

342
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,240
 this was settled for four thousand dollars and the apology that was sent out to all members

343
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,400
 but there were other requests in the lawsuit that were were not they'd not end up in the final

344
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:46,640
 settlement so it appears this is now finished and settled for worldcon 76 and we thought we might

345
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:52,480
 discuss what this means both maybe four worldcon 76 and for other world cons and conventions

346
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,000
 i'm a bit worried about it because i think it makes a statement about the

347
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,120
 efficacy and applicability of codes of conduct which have become very common for conventions and for

348
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,480
 other spaces that fans hang out i mean i quite like codes of conduct i think they're good i

349
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,440
 worry that this makes it that now that we have seen a success it depends how you mean

350
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,640
 successful lawsuit because it seems likely that the costs of bringing this lawsuit were not

351
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,320
 were not less than four thousand dollars because i believe that four thousand dollars were by

352
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:38,000
 about 20 minutes of an american lawyers time so i don't i don't think any was a big winner here but

353
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,600
 i i feel like it may mean that other people are inspired to sue conventions that they don't like

354
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,760
 for doing things that that the convention thinks is reasonable under its its own rule

355
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,280
 so yeah no i'm worried i'm worried about it i'm worried about everything to do with

356
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,280
 the business of running modern conventions but that's one of the things

357
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,840
 i think i say that if you read the email received they're not actually apologizing for banning someone

358
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,320
 from their event under the code of conduct but for the statements they made around it

359
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,880
 so obviously there is it kind of room for conventions if they're worried about their settlement then

360
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,240
 obviously the way to do it now is to just enforce your code of conduct by you know preventing people's

361
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,080
 attendance at the convention but probably not to make public statements about it or to make

362
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,400
 public statements which basically are just sort of incredibly neutral statements of fact so it's

363
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,800
 maybe uh not quite so chilling there i mean what worries me is that yeah you can't really say who

364
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,120
 who has won this one because obviously the settlement is less in the amount that was asked for and

365
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:49,200
 probably is less than the amounts of the legal fees needed to fight it but it also probably costs way

366
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,360
 more than that in legal fees for the convention and it's tied up a lot of their time and effort and

367
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,200
 basically prevented them from fully winding down the convention over the past few years

368
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,840
 so i think it's very much a sort of neutral outcome yeah i mean i think when i've when i've

369
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,560
 been involved in code of conduct things at uk conventions the statements from the convention

370
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,560
 have been really quite neutral for all sorts of reasons um they've been kind of you know we

371
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,440
 determined that a member violate the code of conduct and we've asked them to leave that sort of thing

372
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,600
 so i don't know you know obviously if you kind of go well what are people being saying in private

373
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:32,080
 what are people being saying on all the sort of stuff that can be get subpoenaed then there's a

374
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,640
 there's more of a risk there that stuff would come out that you really didn't want to be be

375
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,080
 public this probably goes back to fanak feeling like work that that sort of sense of oh we have to be

376
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:50,160
 very we have to do everything in a very professional manner all the time makes everything feel much

377
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,320
 harder but on the other hand i do feel that things like the separation of listener teams

378
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,280
 from the main convention management is quite a good way of of actually making sure that the

379
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,440
 people who are dealing with complaints of that kind do treat it very very professionally i think

380
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,840
 like it must have been very stressful for world cons 76 to still have this uh hang over them three

381
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:20,000
 years after um the result i think it's notable that this settlement comes after the judge refuse

382
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:28,160
 um summary judgment which would demand that this went full trial and yeah i can understand

383
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,960
 entirely why world cons 76 have done this um you know i think and you know i think hopefully

384
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:43,600
 sfsfc can kind of move on and um put this behind them because i think they probably deserve two um

385
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,000
 so yeah yeah i think so i think it's a shame because i think they probably went into it with the best

386
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,560
 intentions to make a statement you know which kind of reinforced you know that they had a code of

387
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,360
 conduct and they had certain values they were trying to enforce and basically i think in hindsight

388
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,800
 that statement was an ill-advised statement to make because it left them open to this lawsuit and

389
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,840
 this is going to cost them a lot of time and effort and money i mean i think we should mention it and

390
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,800
 work it's kind of it's just more it's now another thing in the big background of why it's harder to

391
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,920
 run conventions that it used to be on the subject of it being harder to run conventions than it used

392
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:28,480
 to be convergence 2021 is going ahead what are their dates john the fifth to the eighth of august

393
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:37,360
 allison and so this is clearly a decision they've made i think uh because they have contractual

394
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:43,200
 obligations um they basically say they've got a choice between holding this physically or dissolving

395
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,480
 their event company permanently and they've decided therefore to hold a physical convention

396
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:55,440
 and yeah they're so they're going to do that and that's happening um so this is the first science

397
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:03,040
 fiction convention to be held kind of in the brave new world in person the first in-person

398
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,280
 science fiction convention to be held post pandemic it's being held in minneapolis and my impression

399
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,960
 is that the us are now slightly ahead of the uk hunter in terms of second doses so in terms of

400
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,800
 fully vaccinated people um so what do we what do we think about this peeps who's getting the

401
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,800
 plane to minneapolis you're kidding right well i mean i'm hoping to go to a folk festival in august

402
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:33,520
 so you know i'm not completely averse to it i think it reflects the fact that in the united states

403
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,920
 full vaccination it has essentially been available to anyone with privilege for some time now

404
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,040
 because unlike the uk and i guess probably tylen but i think certainly the uk the uk is

405
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:54,160
 vaccinated people in a strict order and unless you were really super rich getting vaccinated out of

406
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,560
 order hasn't happened you've basically wasted your turn and not everyone has had that turn yet

407
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,080
 and not everyone will have had their turn by um this that time in august so i don't think that

408
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,840
 would be practical here because i think there'll be people who we like what we want to come to the

409
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,320
 convention and we very much like to get vaccinated but we're not able to and i just don't think that's

410
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,960
 the case in america i think everyone who wants a vaccination and has the resources to get a

411
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,760
 vaccination which probably means has the resources to go to a convention frankly it's not a huge

412
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,680
 amount of resources required um will have had them by then um so in that sense maybe they do not

413
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,880
 yet have the delta variant they are not in the position where that we are where we're waiting to

414
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,720
 see what whether the rise in cases leads to a rise in hospitalizations and deaths including

415
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,200
 people who are vaccinated i i feel it's a bitterly um and but i understand that they're going to

416
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,600
 go bust if they don't do it so you know i wouldn't go so i i think they do have a few cases of some

417
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,320
 of the variants of concern in the us are just not rising or dominating at the the rate they

418
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,920
 seem to be in the uk and yeah i can i can see that if you're at the state where you know the authority

419
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,440
 is saying if you are vaccinated it is fine to essentially go back and do most of the things you

420
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,720
 were doing before you can take your masks off you can meet other vaccinated people then if you can

421
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,880
 do that on the small scale then maybe you are ready to do that on the scale of you know up to 3,500

422
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,920
 people which is what their maximum participation numbers are and i can very much see that they are

423
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,160
 caught between either we do this or there is no more convergence and so we're going to do this

424
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,520
 and i think it'll be interesting because i think some people do feel okay i i am vaccinated now

425
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,240
 everyone i know is fully vaccinated now if you're in the us you're vaccinated with highly effective

426
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,600
 vaccines yeah it's ready to go back and do it it's two months away so hopefully you know the

427
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,400
 infection levels will drop even further but when i read it i was like wow that seems incredibly

428
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,040
 early because i'm still in the mindset that's thinking can i put 10 people in a room maybe next

429
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,560
 month would that be all right so i am a very simple mathematician here not not really a mathematician

430
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:14,000
 but i'm kind of like so i go and see sit in a garden we sat in sequential gardens in Cambridge

431
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,280
 last week so we saw about 10 people over the course of the day but in four different gardens so

432
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,160
 so the total number of interactions and we were all socially distanced so yeah

433
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,040
 to amooraptors so the social number of interactions maybe i don't know 40 or 50

434
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:37,760
 but if we put the same or fewer 20 and if we put the same 10 people into a room then it's 100 and

435
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:48,640
 if you put uh 81 if you put um 3,500 people in an exhibition hall it's a lot and and that

436
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,840
 increases the risk a lot but maybe not enough i don't know um i will also just note that

437
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,880
 the first convention is on my calendar is the UK Games Expo which is end of July

438
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:09,520
 and will be substantially more people i think than uh convergent would be so i don't know

439
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,360
 oh so you're going to one before that indoors you're going to an indoor in-person convention

440
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,400
 before convergence yeah i think i'm asking are you planning on going to the UK Games Expo?

441
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,040
 oh no i mean so i won't be i won't be um sorry the way Allison said it really confused me

442
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,560
 i don't know why um no so i would have gone to the Games Expo if i had been double vaccinated

443
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:39,040
 before it ran but as it stands i will be vaccinated two weeks after and so going without having had

444
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,960
 both jabs seems like a bad idea mainly because if i caught covid from a convention two weeks before

445
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:52,160
 my second jab ispania would be so smug that she killed you again yeah uh so anyway i so i don't

446
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,840
 think i will but i was planning to if i was double-vaxed and it did look for a while like i might be

447
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:03,440
 but um but no and so this is the other thing because i don't know what the age profile of um

448
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:11,200
 convergences like and the health profile because um i feel as that i'm not that all but i am quite

449
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,960
 fat and i think being fat's really big risk factor for this and and i am therefore more

450
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:25,360
 fretful than i might be if i was um the the in the prime of peak physical health in the way that

451
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:32,320
 john is but i don't know what whether convergence because a lot of like world confants tend to run

452
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,040
 old and unhealthy but other convention they're probably other conventions where that's not the

453
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,120
 case i've never been to convergence but i suspect it skews more towards the younger and healthier

454
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:49,440
 end than a world conf um so the other thing to note about convergence is that because they are

455
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,800
 mandating everyone who goes must have two vaccinations if you are under 12 you cannot go because there

456
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,720
 is no way you will have had two vaccinations and they know this on the web page um i don't i do think

457
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,680
 in their defense it is clear that they are only running this event because they have to and i think

458
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,120
 if you have to run an event this is probably the right set of compromises to settle on um but if

459
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,320
 you are a parent of under 12 year old children that it's going to have a huge impact on whether or not

460
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:22,560
 you can attend um but yeah very interesting very interesting well speaking of somebody who has

461
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,160
 was in this wasn't the position of taking children conventions and um i just feel like

462
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,920
 some conventions aren't really very very good fit for children anyway so it's a shame that they

463
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,760
 can't have kids at this one but lots of conventions are not really a good place to go with kids

464
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,680
 you know you have to think of that all the time when you're thinking about which conventions to choose

465
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:57,120
 world con site selection is now open it costs 50 of your united states dollars to vote and the

466
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:09,200
 options are Chengdu um in 2023 and Winnipeg in 2023 and Memphis in 2033 strangely all winning from

467
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:15,280
 the same year what are the chances i will probably be voting Winnipeg then Memphis then Chengdu

468
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,760
 it would be quite nice to have some of the conversations about world consign selection

469
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,680
 before the last week of the voting period especially for those of us who are not going to DC

470
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:32,640
 um like what i'm not peeps are you going to be voting in site selection i think if i were to vote

471
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:41,920
 today i would put the bids in the same order that you have but i'm not absolutely persuaded yet

472
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,920
 because i really don't feel i've heard enough from either Winnipeg or recently from Memphis i mean

473
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,040
 i think the fact that we haven't heard a lot from Memphis is quite telling but but i feel like i'd

474
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,280
 want to hear a bit more and i'm hoping that opportunities to learn more about the bids will

475
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:06,400
 emerge between now and um between now in the the deadline for site selection the postal

476
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,320
 deadline here's a bit of for people who don't know if you are at the world con physically at the

477
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:19,760
 world con you can vote in site selection right up until lunchtime saturday or something quite

478
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,040
 you know well into the con um at a desk you could basically take your money and pay and they sort

479
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,600
 you out but if you're not at the world con there is a deadline which is some considerable time

480
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,160
 before the convention and so site selection has traditionally been quite a complicated process

481
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:41,520
 even online where essentially you replicate the physical activity of submitting a ballot because

482
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:49,360
 they do quite a lot of work to make sure that the secret ballot is secret because um sometimes

483
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,440
 and this is something about the club ability and entrenched it's kind of like balls in an

484
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,560
 errness and titties they are working quite hard to ensure that people don't find out that their

485
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:08,240
 mates have voted against them yeah so so um so there's quite a lot of structure in the process

486
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:14,320
 to make that happen and it means it's not that simple and you do need to vote fairly well in advance

487
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,800
 in site selection and you need to allow yourself a few hours to get it done you're not necessarily

488
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,640
 going to be able to go straight up to the site and vote and but i would hope that more

489
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:28,960
 infomercial emerged about the bids that allow me to really feel confident in voting for Winnepeg

490
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,760
 and to support that i believe that um tarry fongs a member of punctuation so i'll probably try and

491
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:40,800
 grab him in a bar and tell him to tell me why his bid is so wonderful yeah definitely i was

492
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,720
 going to say fortunately punctuation is virtual and so tarry will not have the experience of having

493
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,840
 like allison spot him on the far side of a crowded bar and you know elbow everyone else out of the

494
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,800
 way to get there and Amanda Pinten reasons why she should vote for Winnepeg i used suggesting

495
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:01,360
 that you see me act to this way in previous years when we were not virtual i don't think she's

496
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:07,040
 suggesting it i think she's saying with her words i will i will take that as a reflective

497
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:14,080
 point of feedback thank you i should say if i i wouldn't go if i saw allison you're like charging

498
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,360
 across the bar towards me i would not go in high but this is partly because i remember

499
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,800
 you doing that in Dublin and you had a load of drink tickets so i did basically i found jc who

500
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:29,760
 was the treasurer of the convention and i i hung him upside down by his ankles until i gave he

501
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,600
 gave me enough drink tickets that enough groats that i could be fairly sure that nobody left in

502
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,440
 the bar would be required to buy another drink for the rest of it would be required to pay for

503
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,760
 another drink and then i stood at the bar making sure that anyone who went up to the bar had

504
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,000
 sufficient drinks to cover their round uh yeah um it was good i don't remember all of that night

505
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:05,920
 we've been talking a little bit about a little thing called punctuation too which is coming to your

 have partied until the wee small hours i mean i will also have part until the wee small hours

521
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:45,360
 where that will be slightly offset for me yes uh so it will be exciting and we have some tastings

522
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:51,680
 lined up so there will be a gin tasting on the friday night and there will be a cheese tasting

524
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:02,720
 so get your cheese beer and gin in we have already said that probably doesn't have to say again

525
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:10,480
 more gin and and last time some people who had got this virtual convention going down to a fine art

526
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,200
 had full english breakfast delivered to their homes and i am going to commend this as a

527
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,920
 method of getting your your full english breakfast because i haven't had a full

528
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,640
 i i don't think i've really had very many full english breakfast in the last 15 months because i

529
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,160
 would have had to have cooked them myself do miss hotel breakfast surprisingly much

530
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,320
 i mean i miss a lot of other things about you know not being able to travel anywhere by two

531
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:41,520
 miss hotel breakfast i mean a good hotel breakfast is a great thing a bad hotel breakfast is not

532
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:48,000
 espania espanias first english breakfast was at the radison edwardian at the 2012 east com

533
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,400
 she had never let me forget it yeah for one of those coms we um

534
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:00,880
 we actually stayed at one of the one of the hotels kind of two doors down but it's the very big doors

535
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:07,600
 but everything apart from the fact that we had to walk for five or ten minutes to get

536
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,880
 home and back everything else about it was infinitely better they had a pool they had

537
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,640
 fantastic breakfast they looked after us properly they didn't treat us like some sort of low-grade

538
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:24,160
 scum um sorry just reminiscing about in-person conventions and how i can't wait to get back to

539
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,040
 them it's going to be good but not yet god we're going to have so much to podcast about when we

540
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,440
 actually owe to in-person conventions it's like do you know that they had a whole room where all

541
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:41,440
 they did was surf beer and chat thank you very much for listening to this episode of the octador

542
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:57,360
 podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

543
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:14,000
 wait for my section on rampant self-promotion later in this episode i like the idea of criscosia

544
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:22,320
 rampant on a coat of arms oh do you know the history of animals rampant on coats of arms

545
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:28,640
 i'm going to assume sex i don't know it's wasn't really the sex it was just kind of rampant and then

546
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,400
 in victorian times they decided they were a bit too rampant and so they kind of

547
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,000
 rearrange the animals so that their rampant nature was less obvious

548
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,520
 chris find a fan like if you could get Vanessa to send us some fan art we will feature it in next

549
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,560
 episode and that would be fantastic this could be the new version of the shield of humor couldn't

550
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:54,080
 it i don't know what that is what's that do you know what the shield of humor is okay um so when

551
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:00,160
 we're talking about um classic fandom and why it's not relevant um it was the it was the thing worn

552
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,800
 by the you know the night's percent fad to me i don't know what that is i don't know it's just

553
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:12,640
 okay fine sorry i've only been in fandom keep your shield of humor brightly polished i mean i

554
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:19,600
 regularly polish my shield of humor yeah yeah oh you regularly polish your

555
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:27,280
 um coat of arms with criscosia rampant uh and then so sorry chris so i feel like this might have

556
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,920
