1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
 Inhursing this joke for months, can I make it funny? Right.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,080
 *laughs*

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:21,120
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 68th episode of Octa Thorpe.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,040
 This episode is coming to you on the 13th of October 2022.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,560
 I'm John Coxon.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,040
 I'm Alison Scott.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,640
 I know, I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,280
 And we have some letters of comment on the previous episode.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,480
 Well, we actually have a letter of comment on episode 63.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
 Yes.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,400
 Kev McVay wrote to us about episode 63, as said this is the first time I've written

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,960
 a letter for several years, and we rewarded him by totally forgetting about it.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
 Sorry, Kev.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,400
 I mean, to be fair, it came in after we recorded 64 and then we went to wait to Chicago and

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,840
 then all of that.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,680
 He talks about thoughts on fantasy con and he kind of talks about what happened there

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,040
 a little bit.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,880
 And then he talks about Deep Wheel Acadia and the other Clark Award books and says that

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,160
 Deep Wheel Acadia is a fascinating prose poem and he would have fought for it had he been

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
 a judge.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,720
 But he says he would have been even more passionate about Burnt coat by Sarah Hall, which he seems

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,800
 to be alone in talking about as SF.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,240
 So I might have to look that up.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,200
 Yes, I will go and check that out.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,720
 I read it, but I've read other, I've read other Sarah Hall novels, which I've enjoyed.

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
 So I will go and check that out.

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,120
 I possibly read them because Kev told me to read them actually.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
 So thank you, Kev.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:45,840
 I went on Zoom to a presentation or a performance of parts of Deep Wheel Acadia by Harry Josephine's

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,200
 Giles at the Edinburgh Festival.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,360
 And it was very good.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:02:01,440
 She did the recitation in Acadian and then there were subtitles with the English translation.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,040
 But I would say that the practice of translating a Scots word, including some Scots words, to

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,160
 common in English, like "cally" and "bide."

35
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,120
 Into every possible translation in English and then mashing them together is a great

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,360
 load of testicles nonsense.

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,960
 I see what you did there.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
 Brilliant.

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,320
 Is that funny enough?

40
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,920
 It certainly, it echoed something we said when we talked about it the first time.

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,120
 It made John laugh, so...

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
 That's a lot.

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,600
 I think that's the harshest lizards ever been about what about us as jokes listeners.

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,840
 So Liz didn't find it funny, but she might have found it funny the first six times I've

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
 said it.

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,640
 Yeah, I think you may.

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,520
 Somebody who isn't one of you guys caught me out doing this at a party a couple of weeks

48
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,080
 ago and I was like, "Yeah, no, it's fair."

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,600
 You go to workshop your jokes with different groups of people, Alison.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,880
 Yeah, but thank you very much for writing in Kev.

51
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,320
 We liked your letter a bunch.

52
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,320
 And Kev also says he finally started listening to Octa.

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,720
 Recently and asks us not to tell him off.

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,440
 We're never going to tell Eddie what off for starting to listen to our podcast.

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,920
 I don't know much about growing communities, but I think part of it is not yelling at people

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,480
 when they join.

57
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,560
 Unless you're in a church that does that sort of thing, in which case it works for them,

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
 but that's not us.

59
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,640
 Yeah, you've never been church with Scotland, have you?

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,520
 That did occur to be halfway through what I was saying.

61
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,800
 And I was like, "Hmm."

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 And we should also in other news or in other mentions that we didn't pick up.

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,480
 Last episode, congratulations to Raj for catching up.

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,240
 We're very sorry that you have to wait two weeks for each episode now.

65
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,880
 There's a lot of Octa though now.

66
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,480
 There's going to be like three whole days of Octa thought soon.

67
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,040
 That's a lot of Octa to catch up on.

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
 Oh, no.

69
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,960
 But I mean, if you don't, if you don't, then you're not going to, you know, get all the

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,280
 Injokes and backstory.

71
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
 So...

72
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,680
 Yeah, I mean, if you're listening to this and you haven't listened from the beginning,

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,240
 that is fine.

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,040
 Do not listen from the beginning.

75
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,360
 This is too late for Raj, but the rest of you can save yourselves.

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,440
 Our sound quality was terrible.

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,160
 The jokes are much the same.

78
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,600
 We also heard from the very vulnerable and respected Mark Plummer.

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,000
 Basically, I said on episode 66 that sending a fanzine to efansines.com was similar to

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,440
 putting a book in the British Library.

81
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,000
 And Mark points out that you do actually have to deposit fanzines in the British Library

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,120
 if you apply for an ISBN for your fanzine or an ISSN, how common boy to one mine has.

83
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,480
 The British Library will hound you for copies until you tell them that you stopped publishing.

84
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,760
 So all of the issues of procrastinations are in the British Library.

85
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
 Although I don't know if we've...

86
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
 I don't...

87
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,000
 I assume that copies of Journey Planet go into, but...

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,600
 Chris, do copies of Journey Planet go into the British Library?

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
 Please write to us.

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 I'd be astonished.

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,560
 Plucked and never deposited, blocked up with the British Library.

92
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
 Boo.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,280
 And was rather sniffy about fanzines that did, because we thought it was a sign that fanzine

94
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,480
 might be a bit up itself.

95
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,160
 So obviously if the British Library had written to us and said, "Send us your fans, you know,

96
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,880
 we will prosecute them, we might have done."

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,720
 What is fascinating about this is that there is one of the three of us that is the most

98
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
 interested in fan history, and it is that person that did not bother to chronicle any

99
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,400
 of the fan history with the Library of Record of the UK, and the person who is less bothered

100
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
 did.

101
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,960
 Yeah, that's because the British Library's record on actually looking after its ephemera

102
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,280
 and stopping it from rotting is not great.

103
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,280
 Other archivers are doing a much better job with fanzines.

104
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,800
 Yeah, no, I have a whole rant.

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,040
 Mark Plummer says that it's his understanding that old time fans were fairly diligent about

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,840
 depositing their fanzines, and so the British Library probably has one of the best collections

107
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
 of fanzines around.

108
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:53,200
 I will apply for a reader card forthwith for the night to go and look at 1967 fanzines.

109
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
 Oh, now.

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,240
 Yeah, no, that would be a great galactic journey column.

111
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,000
 Oh, god, it would.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 That would be quite funny.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,920
 Oh, no, but the British Library didn't exist in that building until really recently, so

114
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,160
 you'd have to be, it would be maybe more difficult than I think it would be.

115
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,680
 I could still talk about going to the British Library with my readers cards and getting them

116
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,240
 to say the things, so I could talk about the, the rotunda and so on.

117
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,240
 And I have to be like, there must be some kind of paper catalogue in 1967.

118
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
 Oh, yes.

119
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,800
 I would be kind of interested if you'd go and do it though and find out what has happened

120
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,560
 to anything they do have from 1967 what quality is it and how easy is it to actually get them?

121
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
 Could be interesting.

122
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
 Well, I mean, I'd have to get a reader's card first of all.

123
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
 I will talk to one of, I know lots of people who do have reader's cards for the British

124
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,640
 Library much more legitimately than this, but I am obviously researching fanzines from

125
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,400
 1967 now, so it's fine.

126
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,840
 You should be able to get one.

127
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,160
 You don't have to have a good reason to have a library card.

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,360
 Wanting a library card is enough, surely.

129
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,240
 Not for the British Library, not for a reader's card for the British Library.

130
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:03,040
 We also heard from Christopher J. Garcia and Christopher said that he was at the 1993 World

131
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,040
 Con, Conference Cisco, and it was his graduation present to himself, and he's pretty sure that's

132
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,000
 where he first met Alison, although anything more than 25 years ago is myth legend and subject

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 to hyperbole.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,200
 I mean, okay, so Conference Cisco is a blur.

135
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,240
 Yeah, it is, it is like one five day blur to a degree that, I mean, more so than like

136
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,800
 most things that happened in 1993 at this point, is it in a special blur?

137
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,520
 Or is it just, it was 1993.

138
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,440
 The extent to which my 1993 holiday in the United States is a blur is one of the reasons

139
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,520
 why I texted Claire a thousand words on what I'd been doing the day before every single

140
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,440
 day of World Con this year.

141
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,120
 That's practice for the guff trip, but I am concerned that my ability to remember things

142
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,880
 is not great.

143
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,960
 I had not previously appreciated that one method of writing your trip report is just

144
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,160
 to text it all to Claire as it happens so she can compile it for you.

145
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,360
 It's definitely a way of doing it.

146
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
 Claire is a saint.

147
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,200
 Claire is an actual saint.

148
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
 Hello Claire.

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,280
 Oh, there's, there's some foreshadowing.

150
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
 Do we do foreshadowing?

151
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,760
 Yes, we do foreshadowing every week.

152
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,480
 We can do foreshadowing.

153
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,880
 That's foreshadowing.

154
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,280
 Chris also says that he thinks the mic situation might have been due to conflicts between the

155
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,760
 hotel and the union that made the costs more than we would think they should have been.

156
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,880
 So yes, I had an author of that, but it is possible that there were some more political

157
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,720
 things happening that made those costs less than just buying some more microphones.

158
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,440
 And thank you for pointing that out.

159
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
 Chris.

160
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,480
 Yeah, there is definitely some stuff which seems quite foreign to me about like things

161
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,400
 which have to be done by unionized employees, which yeah, I think does sometimes involve

162
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,280
 anything that involves like plugging things in and wiring things up.

163
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,120
 And I'm not sure how far that goes in terms of also managing stuff like that.

164
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,520
 They clearly had volunteers who were managing like the live streams, but I don't know for

165
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,600
 instance if running around with an audience microphone would be deemed to be, you know,

166
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,400
 something you should have a union person doing.

167
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,840
 I'm just not sure how far it goes.

168
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,080
 But yeah, I think it is more complicated.

169
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,720
 You couldn't just like go and borrow a bunch of microphones from somewhere and set them

170
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
 up.

171
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
 Yeah.

172
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,720
 So listening, we do not think that Easter contact consists of borrowing a bunch of microphones

173
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,520
 from somewhere and setting them up.

174
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
 Just say.

175
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,440
 No, but I mean, the fact there were four microphones in most rooms.

176
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,080
 You couldn't have just gone and got a fifth one and plugged it in to the existing setup

177
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
 and things like that.

178
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,880
 Faramenderson was rolling with laughter on Facebook about the con running panels.

179
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,600
 Faram said that they couldn't be filled at discount three because yes, the con runners

180
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,840
 were con running.

181
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,960
 So it might be that con running programming has been a problem at both of the previous

182
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,440
 two world cons.

183
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,160
 I mean, I don't know whether this is unique to us world cons, but it's definitely something

184
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,480
 for future world con program teams to think about because, you know, you don't want to

185
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,600
 put all that fantastic work in if it's going to go to waste.

186
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
 Yeah.

187
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,440
 And you might get a lot of people who say one of the things they can talk about on programs

188
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,520
 is con running, but they might basically be able to go to those items and not actually

189
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,360
 attend any because they're too busy.

190
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
 Yeah.

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,080
 So con runners or people who are interested in con running are high risk for not actually

192
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,640
 getting to the program.

193
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:24,040
 And that was the letters of comment.

194
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:31,280
 So since we last recorded the British Fantasy Society have held fancy con and they awarded

195
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,320
 the British Fantasy Society awards there.

196
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,880
 Not many of them I've actually read, but I will call out the Sydney Bounds Award for

197
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,520
 Best Newcomer, went to Shelley Parker Chan, who also got the astounding award from Wilcon.

198
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,320
 So they're doubling up on that one.

199
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,800
 They also presented one to a best on thought he went to Synopticon, the celebration of

200
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,560
 Chinese science fiction, which is definitely on my to read list.

201
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,000
 And his previous pick of mine in octa thought I had completely forgotten.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,120
 And they also presented the Carl Edward Wagner Special Award to Maureen Kincaid Speller,

203
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:22,000
 a fan and critic and former Taff winner and lately senior reviews editor at Strange Horizons.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,600
 Maureen sadly died the day after this award was presented, which is a really a great loss

205
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,800
 to science fiction fandom and to everyone who knew her personally.

206
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,920
 I met Maureen very shortly after I came into fandom in the mid 80s and she was hugely influential

207
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
 on me.

208
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,600
 I mean she was a good friend back in the 80s and she was also very influential on developing

209
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,560
 my thinking, critical thinking as a science fiction reader, because I've been extremely

210
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,800
 voracious about kind of gosh wow oh boy oh boy oh boy before that.

211
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,960
 And I think Maureen was one of the people who really encouraged me to slow down and think

212
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,360
 a little bit harder about what I was reading and why I was reading and what I was getting

213
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,880
 out of it and I hugely valued that.

214
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,280
 And she wrote enormously entertainingly on huge ranges of subjects that were not science

215
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,600
 fiction as well, including especially her cats of which she had a succession all with

216
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,800
 great characters.

217
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,360
 And for many years she's been living out in Folkestone, which feels like it shouldn't be

218
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,040
 as far away as it feels like in Kent with her husband Paul Kincaid.

219
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,280
 So I was very sorry to learn of her illness and then her death.

220
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,080
 Yes I mean she produced great critical works but I also just remember when I came into

221
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,120
 fandom I must have met a pretty early on which would you know make me probably a very over

222
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,680
 enthusiastic and like annoying, like 20 something.

223
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
 And she was just terribly friendly.

224
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,560
 I mean even though I was not a critic and I had no standing in the field, there was no

225
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
 snobby about it.

226
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,240
 She was just welcoming to people who read books and wanted to discuss books.

227
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,440
 I was very privileged to know her and to read what she wrote.

228
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:11,040
 And she was I think the world's leading critic on the works of Alan Garner and I heard one

229
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,840
 thing that people have said in In A Bitchory's of Thoughts is it's a shame that the fantastic

230
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,800
 book that she clearly had in her about Garner is not now ever going to get written because

231
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,680
 I think that's an enormous loss to studies of Garner and his work.

232
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:38,080
 Yes a very great shame.

233
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,320
 One interesting thing that happened this week is that they announced that The Last of Us

234
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,320
 is going to be a major television series from HBO.

235
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,240
 Now The Last of Us Part 2 was one of the Hugo finalists in the best video game Hugo.

236
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,000
 But this is quite interesting because unlike I think most movies and TV shows that have

237
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,840
 been made out of games, they're not saying we need to design a whole plot around this

238
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,480
 world that was used for gaming.

239
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,600
 They're basically saying no we've got a perfectly good plot here and we're just going to film

240
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,160
 it to bring it to new audiences.

241
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,520
 And I thought that was a really interesting development.

242
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,640
 A lot of people who are not me are very excited about this.

243
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,600
 I probably won't want to watch the series anymore than I wanted to play the game but

244
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 you know.

245
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,880
 I mean when you said they announced it, they announced it several years ago.

246
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,320
 Just to find that out.

247
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,080
 Sorry it's got a schedule release date right?

248
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
 Top it go.

249
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,680
 It's got a trailer because it's now done and it's about to be released but I mean they've

250
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,800
 been filming it for years and they announced like three years ago.

251
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,200
 Okay sorry the trailer's excited people because the trailer looks like it might be quite good

252
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,640
 by which I mean it looks exactly like the video game.

253
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,960
 So the people who really like the video game are very excited.

254
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
 Yes that is fair.

255
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:55,960
 I just like the video game.

256
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:06,400
 Glasgow in 2024 has seamlessly morphed like Caterpillar to a butterfly into Glasgow 2024,

257
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,240
 a world con for our futures.

258
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,480
 And they are going to be the 82nd world con and they're going to be in Glasgow, Scotland

259
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,280
 from the 8th to the 12th of August 2024 and you can join now.

260
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,680
 So we're going to talk about the guest of Honorslate which was announced at ChaiCon

261
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,320
 and then we'll talk about other things as well.

262
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,880
 You're going to tell us who the guests are John?

263
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,640
 The guests of honour for Glasgow are Chris Baker who may be better known as Fangorn to

264
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:45,760
 our listeners, Claire Briley and Mark Plummer, Ken McLeod, Neddie Okorafor and Terry Windling.

265
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,480
 That is a pretty good roster especially I think Ken McLeod is a very good choice as

266
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,560
 a preeminent science fiction author of Scotland.

267
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,120
 Chris Baker has been a noted artist in the community for a very long time so it is good

268
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,840
 to see him being recognised on the World Constage as well.

269
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,080
 And we ought to have Claire Briley and Mark Plummer, Friends of the Podcast.

270
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
 Yay!

271
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:18,680
 So it turns out that I had been not paying attention to my email and to the promotions

272
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:28,880
 chat and to the Glasgow at ChaiCon WhatsApp group as a result of which I had no idea who

273
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,480
 any of the guests were when we stood up behind Esther at the business meeting on Sunday morning

274
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,200
 when they announced the site selection results.

275
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,360
 And because I've been a bit busy over the last few days it has not occurred to me to

276
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,760
 ever wonder who the guests of honour for Glasgow might be.

277
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,800
 So they started reading the essay out and the first one was Chris who obviously I've

278
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,680
 known since the 80s definitely and so I was like oh they're probably going to be people

279
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,400
 and authors who are active in the UK.

280
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,720
 I hadn't thought about this at all so I was very pleased to hear Chris's name be read

281
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
 out.

282
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,400
 And our next guest come at the other ends of the alphabet and Esther this kind of leader

283
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,120
 at about half a sentence into the leader and I was like oh this is Claire and Mark.

284
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
 Oh!

285
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,280
 Yes it was quite, I clued in very quickly because I was like well it's a pair of people who

286
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,640
 are going to be read out together and I was like well it's probably Claire and Mark then

287
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,640
 because there's no one else I can think of in British fandom who meet this definition.

288
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,360
 Well yeah it was the point where they talked about their fan writing.

289
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,400
 Oh no I got it before I got it just from the names.

290
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,240
 Oh okay well so John is cleverer than me but at any rate John I was I was um were you

291
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,840
 up at the front as well.

292
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,320
 I'm definitely in John on my Cluedo team not Alison I think so I've learned.

293
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,520
 Oh definitely you should have John on your Cluedo team and not Alison because I'm very

294
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,720
 bad at Cluedo I just kind of wander off and get a drink and stop paying attention about

295
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,600
 the third of the way in and it's not good.

296
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,000
 I'm bad for Cluedo.

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,120
 I lost it and I was on stage at the time and you know along with a thousand other Glasgow

298
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,680
 people it wasn't too bad.

299
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,720
 I lost my composure at that point and I didn't really get it back but I do what I was also

300
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,120
 very excited by Ken McLeod because the first British convention that Ken McLeod was guest

301
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,760
 of Vodirat was plopped.com which I was on the committee for and I was very excited about

302
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,160
 Nadia Cora for because the first British convention that Nadia was a guest of Vodirav was Volekon

303
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,920
 which I was on the chair of and this was on the committee for at least for part of it

304
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,240
 and so it was really great list really well done guys excellent, excellent guest of honor

305
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,280
 I don't think I could have done better if I'd personally been picking them so I'm very

306
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,720
 very happy with your guests that was really really good.

307
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,440
 Yeah I was also at the front I did eventually retreat to my chair because my back was hurting

308
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,580
 a lot but it was really good it was nice the announcement was very good I had successfully

309
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,800
 guessed that Fangorn would be one of the guests in the lift with Liz I did not guess

310
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,280
 correctly the other guests but I had a pretty good stab.

311
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
 What you doing 24 John?

312
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,440
 Oh I have resigned.

313
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,560
 No no no 24 Worldcon because you got called up to the front.

314
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,400
 Oh I've been just generally occasionally helping they said anyone who's helped at all come

315
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,160
 to the front and I was like I guess that is including me smuggling Jin.

316
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:27,060
 And also Esther asked for us specifically and for you specifically I feel like she thinks

317
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,860
 with the official podcast of the Glasgow 2024 Worldcon which we are 100% not guys.

318
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:40,740
 Well but we do have the same purple and in fact we do not have the same purple but we

319
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,540
 do have purple so you know.

320
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,340
 It's true I only need to buy one set of like convention t-shirts for 2024 because I'll

321
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,820
 just wear the same purple one and maybe turn it inside out.

322
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,700
 I think you'll find that Glasgow 2024 merchandise is going to be using a lot of different

323
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,500
 purples and I can talk about why that is at length but it's very very boring.

324
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,940
 Is it because you can't get the same purple in all the different types of shirt?

325
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,380
 It's because every shirt blank company has a slightly different purple.

326
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,660
 We could be the official thorn in the side of podcast of the Glasgow 2024 Worldcon.

327
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,660
 I mean I like to think of myself as an ally.

328
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,140
 Would you say Glasgow 2024 also have their own official Glasgow tartan?

329
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,820
 Yes, landing zone it's called.

330
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,140
 It's very fetching.

331
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,540
 If you watch the Hugos you would have seen Vince Dokoty as one of the people who you know

332
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,780
 the glamorous people who hold the Hugos on stage so people can go and receive them in

333
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,340
 his full landing zone tartan kit and it was very impressive.

334
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,020
 If you watch the was for Christmas meeting for Sunday morning which we're going to put

335
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,020
 a link to in the show notes because it's got all the Glasgow presentations and stuff.

336
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,580
 There's a lot of people wearing tartan kit and looking lovely in it because it's a really

337
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,580
 nice tartan.

338
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:59,180
 It was designed by Sarah Felix and you can buy a kiln or you can go and buy the cloth

339
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,540
 which unfortunately is wildly expensive because that's how much traditionally made tartan

340
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,540
 costs.

341
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,540
 It's not because they're making a huge profit or anything but yeah and it's a really lovely

342
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
 tartan.

343
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,740
 I said we're going to make our own tart and I was like oh oh but it's beautiful so well

344
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
 done guys.

345
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,900
 Now it was very good and it was modelled by Sarah Felix as well as Vince.

346
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,340
 You probably find pictures on various Glasgow outlets.

347
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,540
 Esther has a beautiful mini dress.

348
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,540
 Ian Stockdale had a very fetching kilt.

349
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,220
 Yeah it's a lovely, it feels like a lovely balanced set of guests.

350
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,540
 You know it's got some guests who are very well associated with British fandom but it's

351
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,780
 got some guests who are maybe a little bit newer and have only appeared at one or never

352
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,300
 at a convention in the UK.

353
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:51,580
 It's got writer of science fiction, got writers of fantasy, we've got artists, we've got fan

354
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,580
 writers.

355
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,060
 It's a good set basically.

356
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:00,740
 Yeah I'm going to have to read some of Terry Windling's books which I have not yet done

357
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,660
 but I've read Ken McLeod and Nedy Okoraford and enjoyed their fiction in the past.

358
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:11,220
 I've always wanted to own a piece of Fangorn's art but he's really good to say his art's

359
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,220
 quite expensive.

360
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:18,820
 Ok so Stephen and I bought ourselves a piece of Fangorn art as a kind of present to ourselves

361
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,700
 at the 2014 Wilcon and it has been sitting waiting to be framed ever since so that might

362
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,140
 be my present for myself which is that I should get it framed and get it on the wall

363
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,540
 like somebody who's not a complete idiot.

364
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,900
 I think you should.

365
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,220
 The challenge is to get it framed and on the wall before the 2024 Wilcon.

366
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,220
 Yes.

367
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,820
 It's the most expensive painting I've ever bought.

368
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,900
 We should talk about memberships.

369
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,740
 We should talk about how you can join Glasgow yeah.

370
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,100
 So I am a member of Glasgow, I'm fairly sure I owe them 20 quid but I need to work out

371
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,780
 whether that's true and then give them the 20 quid.

372
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:03,820
 If you were a friend of the bid and you voted at Choycon you are an attending member now.

373
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,540
 If you were a friend of the bid and then you didn't vote at Choycon I believe you can

374
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:15,620
 pay an uplift which is equal to a WUSFUS membership and you will be a full member of

375
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:22,660
 the bid but that includes within it the concept of the WUSFUS membership which is what used

376
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,620
 to be a supporting membership.

377
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,900
 Basically you have to have a supporting membership to go to Glasgow or to support Glasgow and

378
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,060
 you can't sell that on once you have bought it is non transferable but once you have bought

379
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,740
 your supporting membership you can then buy an attending upgrade which allows you to actually

380
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:46,220
 attend the convention and if you later want to sell that attending chunk you can do that

381
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,940
 if you so desire.

382
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,500
 There are discounts for various tiers and there are discounts for young adults and teenagers

383
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,700
 as well.

384
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:03,060
 The cost of a new participant is £170 all in which is £45 for the WUSFUS or the supporting

385
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,300
 membership and £125 to actually attend.

386
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:14,020
 WUSF's memberships is fair to say have caused a little bit of confusion in the community

387
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,620
 despite really just being the new name for supporting membership.

388
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,180
 This is a change that's been made by the business meeting.

389
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:28,700
 I think to make it clearer that everyone is a member of the WUSF because a lot of WUSF

390
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:35,260
 members don't realise that and believe that the things that WUSF does are somehow separated

391
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,980
 from them and they're not part of that.

392
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,100
 So this is to make it more obvious that you are if you're at the WELKON or if you're

393
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,820
 a supporting member of the WELKON just to get a vote packet or whatever your involvement

394
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,780
 with the WELKON is you're a member of the WUSFUSFUS society.

395
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,540
 That gives you all of the rights and responsibilities that go with that.

396
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,180
 Are there any responsibilities?

397
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,340
 The thing is it doesn't really give you all the rights that go with it.

398
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,100
 It's my argument about this.

399
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,700
 No, so it gives you the right to vote in site selection and in the Hugos which are both

400
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:15,060
 obviously key parts of WUSFUS but it doesn't give you the right to vote in WUSFUS.

401
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,660
 So you can't go to the WUSFUS business meeting and you can't affect WUSFUS in any way if

402
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,140
 you only have a WUSFUS membership and that is silly and it is more silly.

403
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,500
 It was silly before they renamed it but now they've renamed it and it really makes it

404
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,060
 clear how silly it is.

405
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,260
 Ooh, that's quite good.

406
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,380
 So they could start to do things like my bank or my building society does where it sends

407
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,740
 me out a pack of papers saying do you want to exercise your proxy votes at the meeting

408
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,140
 and people could turn up at the WUSFUSPISPY meeting with a huge handful of proxy votes that

409
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,220
 they collected from people online and that would be awesome.

410
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
 Yes.

411
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,860
 I can't do that moment because there's obviously no way of doing any proxy voting.

412
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
 No.

413
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,020
 And so it can only be introduced by a vote of the people who are actually attending.

414
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,020
 Yes, it's supposed to make people feel more like members but what it seems to actually

415
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,980
 do unfortunately is be a bit confusing and then when people say, okay, so a member of

416
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,380
 WUSFUS can I vote in the WUSFUS like annual meetings?

417
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,380
 No.

418
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,580
 My second argument against it is I have occasionally sat on bid tables and chattered to people

419
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,980
 who are thinking about coming to conventions and they will say things like, oh, well, I'd

420
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,740
 like to but it's a bit expensive and previously I've been able to say, well, you can just

421
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,780
 buy a membership now because it will never be cheaper and then you can, if you can't

422
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,380
 attend, plan to set it on to a third party and it'll always be at a discount.

423
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,460
 If you, if you sell it to them for what you paid for it, it's probably going to be a discount

424
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,300
 for what it's being sold for currently and so you can usually manage to sell them up.

425
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,820
 This is no longer true because you can't sell the, uh, supporting bit.

426
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,900
 You can always sell the attending bit.

427
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,420
 So unless you really want that supporting membership, it, it's not as good a deal anymore.

428
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,860
 And of course, there are people who like to have supporting memberships anyway, but if

429
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,780
 you're thinking I would love to go to a worldcon, I've never been to a worldcon, but they're

430
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
 really expensive.

431
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,820
 Shall I buy my membership now when it's cheapest, knowing I could then sell it on if necessary?

432
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
 Kind of that goes away.

433
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,620
 I don't know how many people that does affect.

434
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,500
 I don't know how many memberships actually get transferred, but it feels a bit sad I

435
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,260
 can't actually tell people that's an option anymore.

436
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,900
 I will just say that if you are an American worldcon attendee, you should absolutely

437
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,180
 buy it now because the ratio of pounds to dollars will not.

438
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,220
 I mean, might get better if something's got really horribly wrong, but like equally why

439
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,580
 get quite a lot worse.

440
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,220
 So I would say that advice from Liz, if you're in the state, is still pretty good advice.

441
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,620
 That's the OctaThorp currency speculation podcast.

442
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:40,380
 Um, but yeah, it basically means you can't sell on the, it means you can't sell on the

443
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,540
 Wussfuss bit, which means that you could probably get what you paid for it minus 45 pounds.

444
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,940
 And if you are sufficiently hard up, that that is a big chunk of money for you.

445
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,940
 That does change a lot of your thoughts around it probably.

446
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,060
 The reason this was done was because they didn't want people to be able to buy memberships

447
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,540
 to worldcons that didn't include the right to vote in the Hugo's or insight selection,

448
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,300
 which is I think in theory, a very good and noble thing because in the old days, what

449
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:14,540
 you could do is buy an attending membership, use the rights to vote and then sell it on.

450
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,000
 And the person you sold it to would therefore not have the right to vote.

451
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,340
 And there was a thing about kind of the principle of the thing being that every member should

452
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,060
 have the right to vote.

453
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,820
 And they've decided to square the circle in this manner.

454
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:33,220
 I mean, I'm not sure how many people that affects, but I think that was part of the logic.

455
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,700
 That's the nobility thing, but there was also a practical argument, which is that the business

456
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,980
 of tracking, when memberships were transferred, the business of tracking, which rights have

457
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:50,060
 been used and which rights hadn't, was a massive headache for Worldcon organizations

458
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,580
 and the membership team.

459
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,900
 And it's quite unusual for the worldcons to actually, the con-running bit of the World

460
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,540
Con to actually come to Wispers and say, "This is a major pain point for us, and can you

461
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:06,220
 do this thing that reduces the amount of pain it is to run the convention?"

462
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,260
 And this is a case where that happened, which is why Glasgow was planning to do the whole

463
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,980
 Wispers membership thing, even if it hadn't been ratified, they would do it.

464
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,740
 Well, there was a much simpler way of, well, I think there's a simpler way of doing it,

465
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,540
 which is you just declare that you can't split the membership rights in that way and whoever

466
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,060
 owns the membership, owns the voting rights.

467
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:31,260
 Because if it's Hugo nominations and voting, I guess that would only affect the paypons

468
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,660
 because if it's online Hugo nomination and voting, you can always go in and overwrite

469
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,580
 your form on the website.

470
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,580
 And if it's site selection voting, you can vote twice anyway.

471
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,900
 I can see how that would be a logistical nightmare from the administration perspective, though.

472
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:51,820
 So this is a rare case where Wispers has done something that the Worldcon-running community

473
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,740
 that's not the Wispers see bits of it wanted them to do to make their lives easier.

474
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,900
 So, and I would strongly recommend that if you're interested in site selection and fantasy

475
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,540
 and you're in this community, if you're any of the people listening to this podcast, then

476
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,580
 if you can afford it and obviously pay your rent first, buying a supporting membership

477
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,220
 for the Worldcon each year is quite a good way to get your hands on a ton of interesting

478
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,460
 site selection and fantasy and be part of this really excellent global community that talks

479
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,460
 about it.

480
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,740
 I'd strongly recommend having a supporting membership every year.

481
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,260
 And as you know, Bob, I get to a Worldcon about once every five years.

482
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,780
 Sting Lee Sheryl Morgan wrote about Tricon 8 in her fanzine Salon Futura.

483
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:40,020
 And she writes about Wispers memberships and seems to think that it's unpopular with

484
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,020
 the people who are Worldcon runners.

485
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,100
 And she says that, and this is a quote, "I am already seeing people complaining they

486
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,860
 are being ripped off because they are forced to join Wispers when they only want to attend

487
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,940
 Worldcon and that is absolutely a result of the way the changes being explained to fans

488
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,380
 by Worldcons.

489
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,500
 That's a very hard padding to stare for you, Glasgow."

490
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,140
 And so I think she particularly is unimpressed with the job that Glasgow is doing communicating

491
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,940
 this to its membership.

492
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,340
 And so it is interesting to me that you said that Glasgow was planning to do this anyway.

493
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,900
 I might be wrong about that.

494
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,260
 I think they were there.

495
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:17,500
 Because I have to say that although I think it is a little bit complex, I don't think

496
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,380
 Glasgow has explained it very well.

497
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,020
 And so I had assumed that they had not been planning to do it and had done it at the last

498
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,020
 minute.

499
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,260
 And maybe that's unfair and a sorry for anyone who's listening from Glasgow who's like,

500
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,540
 "No, we definitely were planning to do it all along.

501
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,820
 John is being very mean."

502
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,900
 But yeah, I do think the Glasgow pages that explain this, they make it sound very Byzantine

503
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,820
 and I think there are ways to explain this which make it sound quite a lot less Byzantine.

504
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,820
 If you could explain something so it sounds simple, it often feels simple and if you explain

505
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,580
 something so it sounds complicated, it often feels complicated.

506
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,580
 So if Glasgow, if you're listening to this, right, it's a lock.

507
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,220
 I might have been completely wrong there in which I was sorry but also tell us what you're

508
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,700
 doing to make sure that Wilcott and potential members are not put off by having to buy a

509
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,620
 wistous as Angiproted very, very cogently in anonymous flair.

510
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:12,380
 I do think it's getting horrendously complicated just because of all the kind of permutations

511
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,660
 of friends and good friends and bid supporting and so on.

512
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,300
 And the fact that you have, especially if you have full attending and young adult prices

513
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,100
 and child prices and team prices, the matrix of how much it costs you is really, really

514
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
 complicated.

515
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,180
 I think if it applies to you, you probably know, so maybe we need to think about how

516
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,340
 we communicate.

517
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,660
 Maybe it needs to be upfront on the pages, it needs to be the cost for the interested

518
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,180
 person who is just this minute heard about Glasgow in 2024 and just wants to know what's

519
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:45,540
 involved and then a bit late to have the and if you are a friend or a supporter or a pre-supportor,

520
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,140
 this is like how much it costs you because, to be honest, I looked at the matrix of how

521
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,020
 much things cost and was like, I'm just going to ignore this because I know I've rented

522
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,940
 the bin voted so I don't have to worry about it.

523
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,300
 And it was the same for Chengdu, I think they had to basically redraw their list of how much

524
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,100
 it would cost you to do various things because it was so confusing.

525
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,820
 So I think that is an area where we need to be thinking about like what do we communicate

526
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,380
 to prospective members?

527
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:14,220
 I will say, I think you're right, I think that is not as much to do with wistous memberships

528
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,980
 as it is to do with how world con bids are funded.

529
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
 Yeah.

530
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,140
 Because I also found that very confusing with London Con 3 and obviously that was a long

531
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,220
 time before this but like you get friends and super friends and like really really fantastic

532
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,020
 friends and fuck buddies and all of these things and it gets very confusing.

533
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,620
 Is this something I can sign up to for Glasgow 2024?

534
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,020
 I'll ask you for a friend.

535
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,460
 I don't want to make any pronouncements on behalf of the Glasgow 24 con con.

536
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,860
 Sorry, I'm very inappropriate.

537
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,620
 But we are generally very excited about Glasgow, I will be there with bells on.

538
00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:00,460
 I already have my attending membership on account of having pre-friended and then voted.

539
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:05,980
 So I will be definitely there and definitely voting on all the things and etc.

540
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
 I am a friend.

541
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,620
 I am a super, I was a super friend.

542
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:14,700
 So I think that might be the first time I've ever super friended a convention?

543
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,340
 Because that's how excited I was about Glasgow.

544
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,460
 So for people who don't know because I sell t-shirts for a living, I have a lot of money

545
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,460
 in January and no money any other time of the year.

546
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,820
 So either this last January or the one before that, I was like, I have all the money.

547
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,900
 I'll give some money to Esther.

548
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,580
 And Liz has already said that she was also a friend and then voted.

549
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,820
 So is also an attending member.

550
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,540
 So we will see you there.

551
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,660
 If Glasgow is listening, we'd quite like a programme slot to a live octa thought, please.

552
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,180
 It might be a bit early, but yes, happy bit.

553
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

554
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,740
 That's assuming we're still doing the podcast in 2024, which is, yeah, John.

555
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,540
 Even if we're not, we'll do a reunion episode.

556
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,540
 Yeah, no, for that.

557
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
 Not for that.

558
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:05,300
 Unless we're not doing the podcast because we've had a massive dust up of the sort that

559
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,340
 resonates through fandom for generations and people, even if it's me on my own with

560
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,580
 two sock puppets that I have painted, Alison and Liz on.

561
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
 Fuck you, John.

562
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,700
 No, you cannot do that.

563
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,660
 And here begins the massive row, isn't it?

564
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:26,540
 I'm totally fine with that, but I will be judging you for my image rights on the sock

565
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,020
 puppet, obviously.

566
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,660
 Liz is the Bruce Willis of Octorpe.

567
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,740
 We should get one of those galaxy edge artisans to make sock puppets of me and Liz that you

568
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,580
 can only buy at work on.

569
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,740
 Yes.

570
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,820
 OK, who wants to do their pick first?

571
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,900
 I'm going to go last because I haven't picked anything yet.

572
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,860
 I'm frantically scrolling through my good reads.

573
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:01,180
 This is going first in case you struck by lightning before the end of this podcast.

574
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,620
 So my pick is slightly cheating because I haven't finished it because I spent a lot

575
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:11,260
 of this week reading a book for various reasons that we will discuss on Octorpe later and possibly

576
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
 I will send.

577
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,060
 Oh yeah, I spent a lot of this week reading a book too.

578
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
 What coincidence?

579
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,740
 John, did you spend a lot of this week reading a book?

580
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,500
 Now this answer is not going to make you happy because the answer is yes, but it wasn't

581
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,060
 the book I was supposed to be reading.

582
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,420
 Right, Liz, do your pick.

583
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,140
 Yes, so my pick is a video game.

584
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,140
 It is a video game.

585
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,300
 I haven't finished yet, but really I'm already getting the value out of it.

586
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,660
 My pick is Return to Monkey Island, which is the sixth video game.

587
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,300
 I think it's the sixth video game in the Monkey Island series, a series which started

588
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,620
 30 years ago.

589
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,620
 Yup.

590
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,180
 When was the first Monkey Island game game that came out because I played it when it

591
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,180
 was new?

592
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
 See, this is the thing.

593
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,220
 I'm pretty sure I played the secret Monkey Island when it was new.

594
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
 1990.

595
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:06,020
 So we both played the first one when it was new and that although it wasn't before John

596
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,300
 was alive, it was before John could manipulate point and click video games.

597
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,300
 So the secret Monkey Island games are classic point and click adventure games from Lucas

598
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,820
 film, which anyone of a certain age range really remembers fondly.

599
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,820
 They had several sequels, which to me have been a little bit diminishing returns, although

600
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,540
 I haven't played the fifth one, which is supposed to be really good.

601
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,180
 And they suddenly announced a couple of months ago that they had been making a sixth game

602
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,300
 and it was going to come out.

603
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:38,900
 And it's the creators of the first two games, which I feel are the best classic ones.

604
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,820
 Yeah, and it's out and I'm playing it and it is very much like a classic Lucas film

605
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,820
 adventure.

606
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,220
 It no longer has like a big chunk of the screen taken up with verbs that you can use, but

607
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,100
 it's all very inventive so that instead of looking at things when you hover over them,

608
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,820
 it kind of tells you what might happen if you click on them.

609
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,020
 And for instance, I was hovering over a poster and it told me if I clicked on it, I would

610
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,820
 not look at the poster, but I would make a terrible pun about the poster and things

611
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
 like this.

612
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,420
 It is, I mean, it has a lot of fanservice.

613
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,980
 I cannot really say how this places someone who does not know why it is a joke that there's

614
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,380
 a pirate with an ask me about loom button in the bar.

615
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,340
 But if you think that is funny, ask me about loom.

616
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,340
 Yes.

617
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,940
 Because I played loom when it came out too.

618
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,220
 Well, that was your mistake.

619
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
 It was amazing.

620
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,220
 Fantastic game.

621
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,220
 Amazing.

622
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,020
 Just kind of also jit in.

623
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,380
 Anyway, it's got the same puzzle.

624
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,180
 I think the puzzles are a little simpler.

625
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,820
 I haven't had to combine like four items in incredibly weird ways yet, but I have had

626
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,860
 to make a mop from scratch, which was quite fun.

627
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,220
 And so I'm about a third of the way through it and I'm enjoying it immensely and it's

628
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,740
 available for Mac and PC.

629
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,180
 And yeah, if you played any Monkey Island games, you would probably enjoy this one.

630
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
 And Nintendo Switch.

631
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,220
 And Nintendo Switch, but I haven't bought one of those yet.

632
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,900
 And it's interesting because the first ones were developed by LucasArts and one of the

633
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,500
 things that Disney did when it bought Lucasfilm was shut.

634
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,340
 LucasArts, which was probably a fair decision at the time because LucasArts hadn't done

635
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,460
 anything good for a while at that point.

636
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:18,260
 But this is kind of being published by Devolver Digital and they are doing it, I guess, because

637
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,460
 they have negotiated the rights of the Lucasfilm.

638
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,100
 But it's nice to see that kind of Gordian not get cut through because this is the first

639
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:31,460
 game by the creator of the original two games since he left LucasArts in 1992.

640
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,900
 To be fair, I think the fifth Monkey Island, which I haven't played, is a collaboration

641
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
 with Telltale Games.

642
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,780
 Yeah, it was not entirely done by LucasArts all the way through.

643
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:50,700
 That age range that remembers the first Monkey Island extremely fondly has to be quite large

644
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,060
 because it includes people who are Liz's age and also people who are my age and probably

645
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,180
 even some people who are a bit older than me.

646
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,900
 Do you think I've played it very young?

647
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,620
 I've played the Monkey Island games when they got remastered.

648
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,020
 Do you want to do your pick, Alison?

649
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,020
 I do, I do.

650
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,340
 So I read a book all week, but obviously I'm not talking about that.

651
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,340
 And I've probably got a pick for, I'm also watching a bit more of the Expanse, but I'm

652
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,340
 not going to pick that again.

653
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:22,060
 So this time I am going to pick the very timely WandaVision, which I think is about three years

654
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,060
 old now.

655
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,180
 Well, it was up for a Hugo, wasn't it?

656
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,180
 So it was 2021.

657
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,820
 It was up for Hugo this year.

658
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,620
 So it was a 2021 series, but I finally got around to watching it.

659
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,420
 People are tracking my progress through the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

660
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:41,460
 We'll know the time even slightly less behind than I was, but I'm still very behind.

661
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,900
 I thought WandaVision was really quite good.

662
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,780
 So as you know, I have a complicated relationship with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

663
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:55,860
 There is a explanation of senility that says that one of the ways that you can first see

664
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:01,580
 your deteriorating mental state is that you can't quite hold all the elements of plots

665
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,580
 and characters in your head at once.

666
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,700
 So this has happened to me with the MCU.

667
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:11,540
 So I significantly failed to remember key bits about the Marvel canon that it would have

668
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,100
 been quite useful to know before I started watching WandaVision, but it didn't really

669
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,380
 matter.

670
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:24,140
 For those who don't know, it starts as a sitcom featuring Wanda Maximoff, who is an

671
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:29,540
 ongoing character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and her husband, Vision, who is also

672
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,980
 an ongoing character in the MCU, kind of channeling.

673
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:37,100
 I love Lucy and comedy shows of that type.

674
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,540
 And you kind of watch this show.

675
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:45,900
 But apart from just a couple of moments, the first episode is an exact prestige of '50s

676
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,380
 and early '60s comedy shows.

677
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,300
 And then over the next several episodes, it goes forward in time when you gradually work

678
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,460
 out what is really going on.

679
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,220
 And it turns out that it all is not what it seems, which I mean a clever reader will

680
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,860
 have known from the beginning.

681
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,500
 Nine episodes in total, it wouldn't be the MCU without a pointless superhero battle at

682
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
 some point.

683
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,140
 The '50s does happen, but there's not that much of that.

684
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,060
 And it all gets wound up in a very interesting way, I think.

685
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:18,020
 And there's some really good bits about philosophy and identity and culture.

686
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:23,620
 And I thought it was quite a good thing to have on one's 2022 Hugo Ballot.

687
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,700
 It didn't win, did it?

688
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,700
 What did win?

689
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
 -Tune.

690
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,580
 -Arrakis, a desert planet.

691
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,020
 -But it went on as a single series, which is quite right.

692
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,660
 None of the episodes stand alone.

693
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,380
 So I thought it was pretty good.

694
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,300
 I think I would commend it to you.

695
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,380
 -I also liked it.

696
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,980
 It doesn't stick the landing as much as it might have done, but it was filmed from

697
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,900
 November 2019 to March 2020, and then something happened in March 2020 that made it difficult

698
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,300
 to keep filming.

699
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,140
 So I do kind of give it largely a bit of a pass on the ending, because I do suspect that

700
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,940
 if the Covid pandemic hadn't happened, we might have seen it end slightly differently.

701
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,020
 Especially stuff like, "Oh, what's Kat Denning's character's name?

702
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,020
 Liz, who just Kat Denning's play?"

703
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,020
 -Darsie.

704
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,020
 -Darsie.

705
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,980
 Darcy in particular kind of just vanishes, and like, it's like, "Oh, where did Darcy

706
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,980
 go?"

707
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,340
 And the answer is probably locked down.

708
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,180
 But generally speaking, I really liked it, and I especially liked seeing the kind of,

709
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:23,260
 the return of Darcy and Randall to the MCU, because they are both people I very much

710
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,660
 like are not, not Randall.

711
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,380
 Oh, Randall Park is the actor.

712
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,380
 What's the character's name?

713
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,900
 -Liz, what's the character's name?

714
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,900
 -Don't know.

715
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,140
 Go and Google it.

716
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,140
 -Jimmy, Jimmy Wu.

717
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,140
 -Oh, yeah, Jimmy Wu's great.

718
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,140
 -Jimmy Wu is great.

719
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,620
 He should be a more things.

720
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:44,020
 If anyone hasn't seen "Always Be My Maybe," you should, because he is the lead and writer

721
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:50,260
 on that movie, and he is extremely good in it with Ali Wong, who was also a writer and

722
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,260
 the other lead.

723
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,140
 -Didn't we have some pick a few weeks ago where someone recommended something, and then

724
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,460
 John said you should watch "Always Be My Maybe"?

725
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,460
 -Yep.

726
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,620
 I will keep recommending it, because it is...

727
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,300
 I just love that movie so much.

728
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,340
 -Okay, well, that's my pick for next episode sorted then.

729
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,180
 -It's not science fiction though.

730
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,180
 -It's genre, right?

731
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,540
 You promised me it's genre.

732
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,540
 -No.

733
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,540
 -It is genre, just the genre is rom-com.

734
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,540
 -There.

735
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:19,220
 -But it has the best celebrity stunt casting of any movie in the history of cinema.

736
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,780
 -Speaking of celebrity stunt casting and WandaVision, there's a very good bit of celebrity stunt

737
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:30,780
 casting that is taking advantage of the fact that the X-Men is now owned by Disney along

738
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
 with everything else.

739
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:37,020
 -And is quite a funny joke, which I didn't get because I really wasn't paying close enough

740
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,020
 attention to the MCU.

741
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:44,580
 But there's some funny stuff going on around that that I think probably if you're kind

742
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,060
 of into reading Marvel tea leaves gives you some hints about where Marvel might be going

743
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,060
 with the X-Men.

744
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,620
 That's not too much for spoiler is it?

745
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,260
 I don't think that was a spoiler.

746
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,740
 -It's a TV show from 2021 that was nominated for a Hugo.

747
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,860
 So I think you can fairly say the statute limitations is up.

748
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,820
 -Yeah, I don't think that was a spoiler anyway.

749
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,500
 But there's some really funny things in WandaVision as well as some really quite clever things

750
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:12,140
 as well as some really interesting discussions on how you're affected by major life changes

751
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,100
 and what it means to be human and all of that stuff.

752
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,100
 And I really liked it.

753
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,420
 And I like the fact that I was trying to do something a bit more complicated.

754
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:23,100
 -Have you seen Doctor Strange and the multiverse of madness yet?

755
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,100
 -I can't.

756
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,100
 I've got homework, John.

757
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,100
 There are prerequisites.

758
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,060
 There are a lot of prerequisites, right?

759
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,020
 -No, WandaVision is basically the prerequisite.

760
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,780
 -I would argue WandaVision is a strict anti-prerequisites.

761
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,420
 I think maybe by...

762
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,940
 No, not even Spider-Man.

763
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,940
 Maybe Spider-Man.

764
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,700
 But like, WandaVision should be a prerequisite except that the two don't make sense together

765
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,700
 at all.

766
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,820
 -Oh, I thought that WandaVision was the prerequisite for Doctor Strange and the multiverse of madness.

767
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,620
 That was one of the reasons I was watching WandaVision.

768
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,980
 -WandaVision was filmed and written after Doctor Strange was but released before.

769
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,140
 And it doesn't really...the character of Wanda doesn't really make any sense between the

770
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,060
 two movies, I would argue.

771
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,060
 I liked Doctor Strange but I think having seen WandaVision might actually be an impediment,

772
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,060
 not a plus.

773
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:10,020
 Doctor Strange and the multiverse of madness I think has a much stronger reading as to

774
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,180
 what they're going to do with the X-Men than WandaVision does.

775
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,060
 Again, celebrities don't casting.

776
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,060
 -Okay, so are there any other...

777
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:21,060
 I wanted to watch the Spider-Man's before Doctor Strange?

778
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,060
 -All of them?

779
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,460
 -I don't know, which ones?

780
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:29,380
 -I mean, it depends how much you want to do your homework but I mean, they're all referenced.

781
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,140
 -I watched "Hemcoming."

782
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,060
 -I mean, spoilers for a movie that came out a while back.

783
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,460
 I think we've already spoiled this on the pod anyway but the Spider-Man's from the original

784
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,140
 Sam Raimi trilogy and from the amazing Spider-Man are in it so you'd need to watch those five

785
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,660
 and then you'd probably want to watch both of the Tom Holland ones if you want to like

786
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,660
 fully do your homework.

787
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,020
 Oh, and you need to watch Doctor Strange one.

788
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,580
 Or you could just watch it because it's fine.

789
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:58,820
 -Yeah, are you vaguely aware that there has been more than one actor who played Spider-Man?

790
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,740
 Because just go ahead and watch Spider-Man no way home, it's fine.

791
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,020
 -Yeah, no, I think I've had this spoiler already.

792
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,780
 -Yeah, just go ahead, just go and watch this.

793
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,780
 -I love Spider-Man.

794
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:13,100
 -And also I've seen Spider-Piggle, whatever it's called, Spider-Man of the multiverse of...

795
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,300
 -You don't have to have seen that one.

796
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,300
 -Oh, boo.

797
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,180
 -I mean, you do on account of how it's a great movie.

798
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,100
 It's a good film.

799
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,980
 -I will say the thing I really like about No Way Home is that it gives Andrew Garfield

800
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:31,540
 Spider-Man like an actual ending, which I really enjoyed because Andrew Garfield, although

801
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:36,220
 I don't think, especially the amazing Spider-Man 2 was a hot mess by like Andrew Garfield's

802
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,060
 portrayal of Spider-Man the best out of the Spider's men there have been.

803
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,420
 -On the count of Andrew Garfield's a really fantastic actor and he's good in every single

804
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,620
 thing he does to the extent that...

805
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,620
 -Yes, he is.

806
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,060
 -I will actually go and look for things that have Garfield attached to them now because

807
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,060
 I think he's very good.

808
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,060
 -He's just great.

809
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,420
 -So, yes, I was thinking of watching So Homecoming and then there's probably another one after

810
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,420
 Homecoming.

811
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,420
 I've seen Homecoming.

812
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,060
 -There's Spider-Man No Way Home.

813
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,900
 -There's Homecoming and then there's Far From Home.

814
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,820
 -Oh, it's Far From Home, yeah.

815
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,580
 -Homecoming then Far From Home then No Way Home.

816
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,780
 -Right, so we need to see Far From Home and No Way Home.

817
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,020
 So that should be doable.

818
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:15,980
 I can probably fit a Spider-Man into today probably.

819
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,060
 -So, with a month maybe.

820
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,900
 -I'm going to do my pick.

821
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:27,380
 My pick for today is a vertical empire, History of the British Rocketry Program by C.N. Hill

822
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:32,060
 which is a book that was recommended to me by Nick Gibbons.

823
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,820
 This book is really good.

824
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:40,300
 It explains kind of the history of British Rocketry and why British Rocketry didn't continue.

825
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,380
 Spoiler, it turns out it was mostly the Civil Services fault which is really interesting

826
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,500
 but basically it's mostly because the Treasury really hated the British Rocketry Program

827
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,500
 and blocked it until it went away.

828
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,700
 But it's really fascinating.

829
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,020
 It has like all the documents and stuff and the appendices actually list like a bunch of

830
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,380
 them in full if you're very, very interested.

831
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,020
 It's interesting because it deals with the different parts of the program in different

832
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,020
 chapters.

833
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,820
 It's not the way I would have structured it.

834
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,700
 I think there are parts where it repeats itself because of the way it chooses to structure

835
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,700
 the history but it's still extremely, extremely compelling.

836
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,820
 And I did find it fascinating and it has a lot of really good detail.

837
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:23,060
 I think another reading of this is that the boffins did not even bother to do the minimal

838
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:28,300
 political work, putting the minimal political work to ensure that there were people in the

839
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,620
 right places who cared about what they were doing.

840
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,820
 No, you haven't read the book, have you?

841
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:37,900
 But that's a book written by somebody who has romantic attachment to the British Rocketry

842
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,900
 Program.

843
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,740
 The book concludes with the message that the British Rocketry Program should have been

844
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,740
 cancelled.

845
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,820
 So the book has no particular attachment to it from a...

846
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,460
 It does, from the perspective that the author really likes rockets but the book is very

847
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,380
 clear that the British Rocketry Program did not make sense, almost the whole way through.

848
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:03,060
 The civil service was sharply divided and you get a real sense of the politicians who were

849
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,420
 supporting the project versus the politicians who weren't and did tell you the civil servants

850
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,780
 who were versus the civil servants who weren't.

851
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:15,900
 The real problem, I think, is in the fact that the civil service after World War II had a

852
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,700
 very fragmented structure around particularly aerospace.

853
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,980
 There were like five different ministries, each of whom had a slice of the jurisdiction

854
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,180
 for this project, whereas the treasury was a single entity.

855
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,300
 And so I don't think the problem was that the boffins didn't do their homework.

856
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,500
 I think the problem was that the civil service was hopelessly disorganized on the side that

857
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,460
 was pro this project and extremely organized on the side that wasn't.

858
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,820
 Most of the politicians were in favour.

859
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,780
 It was definitely the civil servants that were the issue.

860
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:52,460
 Politicians are normally in favour of extremely public friendly construction projects.

861
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:57,060
 So the fact that politicians are in favour of this, politicians like to build things right

862
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,620
 and rockets are a thing that you can build and then you can put them into the sky and

863
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,540
 it makes a big splash.

864
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,780
 Like I say, I would strongly recommend reading the book before interpreting the book, but

865
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,340
 it's a very interesting book.

866
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,820
 And it gave me a good, a very good insight into how much British policy is nothing at

867
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,180
 all to do with the party that's in power.

868
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,180
 Historically, you are right.

869
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:23,340
 In terms of the way things are now, so many good people have left at this point.

870
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,100
 That was the OctaThought Podcast and it's goodbye from me.

871
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,100
 It's goodbye from me.

872
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,100
 And it's goodbye from me.

873
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:50,700
 [Music]

874
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:55,780
 Would it be too harsh at this point to note the dictionary definition of narcissism?

875
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:00,600
 Of sentinus from a rising from failure to distinguish the self from the external.

876
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,100
 I never deny it.

877
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,580
 I have never denied this.

878
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:10,580
 But I did like Google help with narcissism and it's all, and it turns out that the internet's

879
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,740
 full of what you do if there are narcissists in your life and not, and there's not a lot

880
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:19,900
 about what to do if you are one of them.
