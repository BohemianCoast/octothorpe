1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
 Oh to the podcast corner is from me this time.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,200
 Hang on, I'm gonna sneeze.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,160
 - Well that's the pre-show.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,360
 Just Liz refusing to sneeze after promising us a sneeze.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,240
 Sneeze Liz, sneeze, sneeze!

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,600
 - It's there, hang on.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,680
 No, it's gone now.

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,880
 See if, get up.

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,920
 - If you shall sneeze at someone loudly enough,

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,880
 they can't sneeze and it's the worst thing.

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,560
 It's planning to just be every time I try and sneeze

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,280
 and it is, it should be banned.

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,120
 But it is hilarious, do it to your loved ones.

14
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,360
 They will be so annoyed with you.

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,200
 Sorry Liz.

16
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,640
 (laughing)

17
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,440
 - We made Alison cry again.

18
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,560
 (laughing)

19
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,800
 Yes, okay, well that's the goals of podcast of the year.

20
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,380
 (upbeat music)

21
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:52,840
 - Hello everyone and welcome to the very 55th episode

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,160
 of OctaThorp, the podcast for Science Fiction

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,480
 and Science Fiction fandom,

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,760
 which is coming to you on the 14th of April 2022.

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,040
 I'm John Coxon.

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,480
 - I'm Alison Scott.

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,720
 - And I'm Liz Batty.

28
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,600
 - We got nominated for a Hugo Award.

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,800
 - I was good to say,

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,800
 did we have any news this week guys?

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,480
 - I don't know, I was too busy

32
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,920
 being nominated for a Hugo Award.

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,200
 (laughing)

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,240
 It's so exciting.

35
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,160
 - Quite nice.

36
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,200
 - Very happy.

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,040
 - Yeah.

38
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,880
 - It's very nice.

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,800
 - Congratulations to everyone else

40
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,720
 who was nominated for a Hugo Award,

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,720
 specifically in the fan cast category.

42
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,680
 - It's a really good ballot.

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
 We're really happy to be on the ballot

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
 with the other fan cast

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,640
 and we'd be very happy to lose to one of them

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,840
 as we fully expect to.

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,720
 - Yes, so the other nominees,

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,680
 or sorry, the other finalists are Be the Serpent,

49
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,600
 the Cooed Street podcast, Hugo Girl,

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,160
 our opinions are correct and well-building for masochists.

51
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,040
 Us and Hugo Girl are new to the ballot this year

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,120
 and we would be very happy to lose to any of the other finalists

53
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,160
 but I think we would all be particularly thrilled

54
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,640
 to lose to Hugo Girl.

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,520
 So we recommend everyone goes and listen to them

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,040
 'cause they are brilliant.

57
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,840
 - 'Cause we really like it.

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,080
 And we all listen to,

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,520
 now I don't know if we all listen to it.

60
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,280
 I listen to a Hugo Girl very regularly.

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,440
 - We do, we all listen to it.

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,920
 Especially their most recent episode

63
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,760
 which was them opening up all the champagne

64
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,920
 and just squealing a lot, which was lovely.

65
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
 - Haven't heard that yet.

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
 (laughs)

67
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,200
 Haven't got around to that.

68
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,360
 Shit, we should have opened up all the champagne

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,080
 and it's squeezed a lot, guys.

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,760
 - John, can you add some fake champagne popping noises

71
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,320
 because it is 10.30, so I feel it's a little bit early

72
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,240
 for the fits.

73
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 - Yes, witness this Liz.

74
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,880
 (popping)

75
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,200
 (laughs)

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,000
 - Okay, so for people who don't have a video on their podcast,

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,320
 that was John beatboxing champagne opening.

78
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,160
 (laughs)

79
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,320
 Well, that's the name of the episode.

80
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,080
 - We did actually get the email saying

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,640
 your Hugo finalist at about 11 o'clock at night.

82
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,840
 It's quite late.

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,800
 I was in bed and.

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,320
 - Was 6 a.m. Bangkok time and we did not ring Liz.

85
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,760
 - And it was 6 a.m. Bangkok time

86
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,560
 and John and I were on chat going,

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,880
 "Should we bake? Should we be finalist?

88
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,560
 Should we be finalist?"

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,200
 - See, so the way I found out we had a Hugo nomination

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
 was I looked at my phone

91
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,560
 and I had like 97 messages from John and Alison

92
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,200
 and I thought, "I either John and Alison had no argument

93
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,840
 while I was asleep, or we got an email about Hugo's?"

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
 (laughs)

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
 - That first one was not impossible.

96
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
 It has happened.

97
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,000
 - Oh yeah, I mean, that's why Liz very sensibly

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,760
 didn't immediately rule it out,

99
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,280
 but I'm glad it was the second one.

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
 (laughs)

101
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,440
 No, so thank you so much to everyone who dominated us.

102
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,280
 It is genuine thrill and we're all very surprised

103
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,520
 and excited and we're all going to be in Chicago.

104
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
 I mean, assuming nothing goes wrong,

105
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,280
 we are all planning to be in Chicago for Worldcom.

106
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,400
 - Are we? 'Cause Liz was like, "I'm not 100%."

107
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,480
 - Oh no.

108
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,040
 - And I'm like, "I'm booking flights next week after Easter."

109
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,280
 - I'm not 100% yet.

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,880
 - Chicago sent us a nice thing saying,

111
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,560
 "If you're finding it hard to manage the cost

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,800
 of going to a Worldcom,

113
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,520
 then consider applying for our fund

114
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,840
 for underprivileged people

115
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,800
 and obviously the problem I've got is that

116
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,120
 I am dripling in privilege,

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,080
 but I am not dripping in money, so.

118
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,640
 But I have my need to find just about enough money to go,

119
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,400
 but obviously I can't, you know,

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,200
 if you want to support underprivileged people to go to Shikon,

121
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,960
 please do that, don't support me.

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
 I can't find the money, but.

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,960
 - If anyone was thinking of sending Alison some rare emeralds,

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,920
 then this would be the week.

125
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,800
 (laughs)

126
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,200
 - Yeah, if we mentioned Alison's rare emeralds collection lately.

127
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,480
 If anyone ever sends me vintage emeralds at this point,

128
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,080
 they're going straight into the Worldcom bursary fund

129
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,600
 for underprivileged people who aren't me.

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,880
 - This segues very neatly into letters of comment

131
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,800
 because lots of listeners wrote to us

132
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,120
 to congratulate us for our nomination.

133
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,480
 And thank you to everyone who got in touch.

134
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,880
 We really appreciate it,

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,040
 even if we didn't respond to everyone individually.

136
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,080
 But yes, thank you so much to everyone

137
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
 for their kind words.

138
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,600
 But let's get into the subject of podcast distracts

139
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,120
 because Ali Baker recorded a diss track

140
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,240
 based on something Liz and Alison said.

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,920
 Liz and Alison take it away.

142
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,400
 - What's a diss track?

143
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,480
 - What do you mean what's a diss track?

144
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,920
 It's when a rapper drops a track

145
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,960
 that disses another rapper.

146
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,880
 - Oh, oh, diss, right.

147
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,120
 - I mean, but we were wrong.

148
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
 And Ali explains why very nicely

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
 in her latest episode of fantasy book swap.

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,520
 - She thinks we were wrong.

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
 - Well, she doesn't think we're wrong.

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,880
 She just thinks we, you said that a deadly education

153
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,320
 challenged class in Harry Potter.

154
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,840
 And I think you said it might have been one

155
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,720
 of the first books to do it.

156
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,240
 And then she dived into some of the history

157
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,920
 about that in her latest podcast episode

158
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,280
 because that is her research,

159
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
 specialism.

160
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,760
 So she is a quantifiable expert.

161
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,600
 - Yeah.

162
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,440
 Okay.

163
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,280
 So I think we should say that whenever we veer close

164
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,360
 to a topic that one of the three of us is an expert on,

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,120
 we veer back sharply noticeably

166
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,440
 what the weather is like outside of this is window

167
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,640
 and what the virus is like.

168
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,880
 And I'm not an expert on anything.

169
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,640
 So it's quite easy that way, except being old.

170
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,480
 - That's not true.

171
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,600
 You're an expert on t-shirts, Alison.

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
 - Okay, we do talk about t-shirts quite a lot.

173
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,600
 So maybe not then.

174
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,360
 - Yeah, but anyway, so yes, a proper academic

175
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,880
 has taken us to task for doing a podcast

176
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,720
 where we went off on one about her research topic,

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,160
 which is fine.

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,880
 - Which is fair 'cause I don't think,

179
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,600
 I don't think we ever claim to be giving more

180
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,040
 than our own half-hosts on the subject.

181
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,640
 - Oh, and it's a wonderful, like, it's more of a verist.

182
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,480
 It's brilliant.

183
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,720
 I really enjoyed the episode.

184
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,920
 It was very good.

185
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,360
 And we've not had an entire podcast episode

186
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
 letter of comment before.

187
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,440
 So thank you very much to Ali for that.

188
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,840
 - And we will put a link in the show notes.

189
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,600
 - We will indeed.

190
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,200
 Malcolm Hutcheson wrote in to say,

191
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,440
 "John only has one shelf of board games.

192
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,200
 Is it a very long shelf?"

193
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,360
 Now, I was using the word shelf to mean piece of furniture

194
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,040
 on which there are many shelves,

195
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,120
 which I appreciate is one of those irregular nouns,

196
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,520
 which is deeply unhelpful.

197
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,240
 - Yeah, the words you're looking for is bookcase, I believe.

198
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,040
 - Well, no, 'cause it's not a bookcase.

199
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,360
 - It's a set of shelves.

200
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,760
 - It's too deep.

201
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,520
 Well, 'cause, and I've got a bookcase behind me,

202
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,720
 which does have game content on it,

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,960
 but most like bookcases are too shallow for board games.

204
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,920
 That's why the Calax has been so popular for gamers

205
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,440
 because it is deep enough to actually fit board games on.

206
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,800
 But I have a bookcase behind me

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,320
 that has lots of kind of role playing books and stuff on it.

208
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,440
 And then I have a set of shelves downstairs

209
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,360
 which has all of the actual board games on it.

210
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,120
 And so it depends how you count, Malcolm.

211
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,120
 I think you should come and see my board game collection

212
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
 and play some.

213
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,760
 It's quite big.

214
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,400
 - I just want to say that the look on Liz's face now is,

215
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,160
 I want you guys to finish by 11 o'clock

216
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,360
 and John is going off on one of the bachelor's shelves.

217
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,840
 - No, no, my look was John just out of context saying,

218
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,240
 "It's quite big."

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,560
 (laughing)

220
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,080
 Liz, family show.

221
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,320
 We also got a note from DC.

222
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,440
 DC said that they would like to thank Alice and Scott

223
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
 and Duncan for the demonstration of the utility

224
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,600
 of removing glasses and growing a beard

225
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,880
 as an effective disguise.

226
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,280
 Duncan also tweeted us saying,

227
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,480
 "Aha, let me listen to Octo-Thopcast.

228
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,720
 "Ooh, has Alice and committed evil yet?

229
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,880
 "Ah, the photo of John is terrifying.

230
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,320
 "Curses, Liz made the joke.

231
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,400
 "I was about to tweet in the actual podcast."

232
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,640
 And he concludes that that was an emotional roller coaster.

233
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,360
 And we're sorry for the inadvertent emotional roller coaster,

234
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,680
 Duncan.

235
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,440
 - We should maybe say this is all about last week's cover art,

236
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,760
 which if you haven't seen it,

237
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,840
 you should go and look at it.

238
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,040
 I can't describe it.

239
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,640
 - Nick Gibbons reacted to the GIF of me being very sweaty

240
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,480
 at weddings with good Lord.

241
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,880
 It's too early for this.

242
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
 And we would like to sincerely apologise

243
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,040
 to anyone for whom this is their first episode

244
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,280
 of "

245
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,080
 "I've got to talk coming off the back of our

246
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,760
 "Hugh-Hugh nomination."

247
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,840
 Because if you scroll down far enough on our Twitter,

248
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,720
 there is, I'm so sorry, we didn't think that through.

249
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,840
 Basically, long story short,

250
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,480
 I get very sweaty at weddings.

251
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,960
 Let's just draw a discreet veil.

252
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
 - That's from a long time.

253
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
 I mean, you need to listen to the last episode.

254
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,120
 Although it episode before.

255
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,320
 When you guys were expressing some concern

256
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,120
 that the first people think people might see

257
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,680
 on the Octo-Thopcast was the sweaty John GIF,

258
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,680
 or sweaty John, sweaty John GIF.

259
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,280
 - This is hard.

260
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,120
 Words are hard.

261
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,080
 - I think our podcast official should be GIF.

262
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,240
 - We're GIF people.

263
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,640
 I was like, well, I think that anyone who's first reaction

264
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,720
 on hearing the Hugo Ballot is to scroll down

265
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,120
 the Twitter piece of the best fan cast category

266
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,800
 is probably deserves everything they get.

267
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,240
 - Not sure anyone deserves that sweaty John GIF.

268
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,760
 (laughing)

269
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,040
 - I made it like, it came out.

270
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,400
 I was like, is this going to come out well?

271
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,920
 I was like, oh.

272
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,240
 (laughing)

273
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,480
 - Okay, and then finally,

274
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,120
 Johnny Badley writes,

275
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,640
 he really appreciates the in-depth discussion

276
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,200
 of things like how world cons work

277
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,880
 as someone who isn't as embedded in fandom.

278
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,040
 It's really helpful.

279
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,200
 And then followed up with,

280
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,920
 is there any way we can donate to the podcast

281
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,800
 to help hate for hosting and Weabix?

282
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,480
 And the short answer to that is,

283
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,240
 we'll all be at Eastcon and we all drink beer.

284
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,520
 So if anyone feels like they would like to donate

285
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,040
 to the podcast, please do feel free to buy us

286
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,840
 one point of beer and we will all share it

287
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,200
 with a little straw.

288
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
 (laughing)

289
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,680
 - We have to have an evening in the bar

290
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,440
 where we do this with some,

291
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,640
 'cause we already have a beer

292
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
 that we're going to drink together.

293
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
 We do need to drink a beer with three straws

294
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,280
 under our masks, so now.

295
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,800
 - Oh.

296
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,680
 - Shall I bring three bendy straws to Eastcon?

297
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
 - Yes.

298
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,960
 It is something we've sort of vaguely discussed

299
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,360
 after Johnny asked and I think the basic conclusion

300
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,480
 is that this podcast does not cost enough to run

301
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,080
 and we are not sufficiently unwealth-privileged

302
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,920
 that we feel it would be a good use of anyone's money.

303
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,040
 So.

304
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,440
 - Yeah, full disclosure guys,

305
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,560
 this podcast currently mostly paid for

306
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,120
 by the occasional adverts for Stowe shirts.

307
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,800
 We'll put a link in the show notes.

308
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,720
 Who will be at Eastcon?

309
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,600
 So one other way you can support the podcast

310
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,880
 is to buy stuff from Alison.

311
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,240
 Yeah, and we'll put a link so that you can buy more things.

312
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,120
 So the I pay for bits and pieces of our hosting so far

313
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,920
 and I also do ads occasionally

314
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,120
 and every so often somebody buys a sweatshirt

315
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,360
 and it all sorts of adverts, so it's fine.

316
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,240
 - On the topic of OctaThop merch,

317
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,600
 there will be a misprinted OctaThop t-shirt

318
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,880
 at the Amaze Balls table at Eastcon.

319
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,720
 And Alison, do you want to tell the listeners

320
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,160
 about Amaze Balls?

321
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,400
 - It's actually we're doing two things,

322
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,560
 a t-stiff of the fanfons.

323
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,680
 There will be a fanfons table,

324
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,080
 which you can need to come and find

325
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,200
 in one of the dealers rooms

326
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,080
 and it is doing two different enterprises.

327
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,400
 The first is a silent auction

328
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,160
 and you don't need to be at Eastcon for this.

329
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,320
 You can bid online

330
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,920
 and there'll be lots of things in the silent auction

331
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
 which might include the misprinted t-shirt actually.

332
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,080
 I don't think it's necessarily gonna be

333
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,720
 an Amaze Balls virus.

334
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,520
 And then the other thing we're gonna be doing is,

335
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,560
 and you also probably don't need to be at Eastcon for this either

336
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,600
 because maybe doing a virtual version of it

337
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
 is you donate money to the fanfons for spins

338
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 of a bingo spinner.

339
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,240
 And when you spin the bingo spinner,

340
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,680
 you get a ball numbered between one and 90.

341
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,400
 And we say something like, I don't know,

342
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,480
 two little ducks, 22 or something of that kind.

343
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,080
 And we give you a prize.

344
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,600
 Every single spin wins and spins cost a pound

345
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,080
 or six for a fiver.

346
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
 And some of the prizes are amazing.

347
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,480
 That's what's called Amaze Balls.

348
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,560
 Some of the prizes are amazing,

349
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
 but not necessarily in the way you'd want.

350
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,440
 And if you'd like to give us your prizes back,

351
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,800
 that'll be an extra pound.

352
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
 (laughs)

353
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,120
 I have a variety of things that I'm bringing

354
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
 to Eastcon for the fanfons.

355
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,520
 I've got a tiny little astronaut keychain,

356
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,560
 which is very cute and lovely.

357
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,960
 And I've also got a hilariously oversized pair

358
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,840
 of Dr. Pepper branded underpants.

359
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,440
 So, you know, paying that pound to re-donate may or may not

360
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,280
 be something you wanna do depending on the prize.

361
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,600
 Yes.

362
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,040
 Friend of the podcast, Dave Coxon,

363
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,560
 and I once wore the Dr. Pepper underpants

364
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,840
 because they are large enough that you can fit one human man

365
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,680
 in each leg.

366
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,840
 And so there is a photo of the two of us

367
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,160
 on Insta in these underpants.

368
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,080
 We're fully clothed, obviously.

369
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
 And therefore, in the show notes, yes.

370
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,520
 Yes, we will link to it in the show notes

371
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,040
 and we'll know what you could win.

372
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,560
 And we are going to be recording live at Eastcon.

373
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,600
 We've been recording at Monday at 1.30pm.

374
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,080
 We are on the programme at 1.30pm in Devere on the Monday.

375
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,320
 Oh, the other thing you could do to support the podcast

376
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,760
 is vote for conversation 2023 for the Eastcon.

377
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,600
 I hope you guys are voting for me.

378
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,760
 Yeah, so.

379
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,600
 (laughs)

380
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
 I mean, it's an open vote,

381
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
 like show of hands on the floor, right?

382
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,960
 So Alice and Will know if we voted for her.

383
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,440
 It's an open vote, show of hands on the floor, but I don't mind.

384
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,960
 People are okay to vote for the other bit.

385
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,600
 I don't have a problem with it.

386
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,160
 We're basically offering a completely different choice for Eastcon.

387
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,000
 So.

388
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,400
 Do we know it's an open show of hands?

389
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,320
 Because I've never been to a contested recession

390
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,280
 and I don't know what they are like.

391
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,440
 Back in the day, it was an open show of hands.

392
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,560
 And then if it is not obvious which bid is won,

393
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,920
 it is then taken to a lobby vote like Parliament.

394
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,320
 You actually walk through the door and somebody counts you.

395
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
 You might very well think that a serpentine

396
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,160
 would be a better way to do it and you would be right.

397
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,000
 But that's how it's done.

398
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,520
 It's done as a show of hands and if it's not obvious,

399
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,800
 it's a lobby vote.

400
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,680
 And it might even be eyes and nays, but I think it's show of hands.

401
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,520
 Because eyes and nays don't aren't public, right?

402
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,160
 Well, yeah, but they also privilege people with louder voices,

403
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,360
 whereas a hand only privilege people who have two hands.

404
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,800
 Do I have a problem with?

405
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,920
 Do I have? Yeah, but I mean, obviously we have a...

406
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,120
 Yes, you do, Alice, and you have a principled problem.

407
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,720
 Are you saying I have loud voice privilege, John?

408
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 Does anybody else on this podcast have loud voice privilege?

409
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,640
 The entire podcast?

410
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,840
 Anyway, I was not...

411
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,200
 I was saying other people are free to vote for whatever they want,

412
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
 but what I'm saying is if John and I vote against Alice,

413
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
 and she will know.

414
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,360
 Yeah, I will know and I won't mind. It's fine.

415
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,320
 And also, another way you can support this podcast

416
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,640
 at the bidding session is by voting for EasterCon 2024.

417
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,960
 I do want to say something about...

418
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,320
 I am very excited that the three of us will be at EasterCon together.

419
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,600
 It's something I have been hoping to do for a long time,

420
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,320
 and it's really good.

421
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,840
 And this podcast is dropping on Maundy Thursday,

422
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,280
 so lots and lots of people are going to be listening.

423
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
 Well, being a bit sad, they can't be at EasterCon,

424
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,720
 but there's some virtual stuff, and I think we'll be live streamed.

425
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,880
 So I think Octa Thought Live is probably going to be live streamed.

426
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,240
 Live, Octa Thought Live, yeah.

427
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,920
 Yeah, Octa Thought Live, actually live, and also recorded.

428
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,760
 So the Hugo Award finalists are out.

429
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,840
 Do we think there is a clear influence of the Chinese supporting members

430
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,560
 for Ch icon on those nominations?

431
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,560
 I confess I can't see anything that I am surprised

432
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,760
 is on the ballot from an Anglo-centric perspective.

433
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,880
 So my inclination is that it has not necessarily had the big effect

434
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
 we expected it might.

435
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,440
 What do you two think?

436
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,880
 The only thing I did wonder about was the Korean film Space Sweepers,

437
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,120
 which is not necessarily...

438
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,360
 It's a bit of a surprise on the best dramatic presentation.

439
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,480
 Ballot is not a huge surprise.

440
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,120
 I'm looking forward to watching it because I haven't done that.

441
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,000
 The only person I knew was watched it is Fran,

442
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
 because Fran watches everything.

443
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,800
 Well done Fran, but she's my only letterboxed friend who's seen it so far.

444
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,160
 I'm sure I'll watch it in the next little bit,

445
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,640
 but I didn't see any Chinese.

446
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,000
 It looked like it's a really good ballot.

447
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 It's full of lovely things, and I'm not just saying that because I'm on it.

448
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,400
 I'm going to push back slightly on the Space Sweepers thing

449
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,160
 in that Space Sweepers came out on Netflix, right?

450
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,840
 I'm not sure you can officially watch Netflix in China.

451
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,240
 Oh, that's interesting.

452
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,880
 So it probably represents no Chinese influence whatsoever there.

453
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,240
 Alissa talks total ballocks again.

454
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
 Can you believe it, listeners?

455
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,840
 Well, I think you may have fallen into the risk of saying, you know,

456
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,720
 something which is it is the only kind of non-U.S. nominee, I guess,

457
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
 non-U.S. or UK possibly.

458
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,600
 But I think that just reflects people watching a bit more widely

459
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,720
 and not necessarily a particular country's influence.

460
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,640
 I think you could well be...

461
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,120
 I understand why I also called it out because I do think,

462
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,120
 like, I think a lot of Chinese fans do have the ability to watch things

463
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,720
 that are not officially available in China.

464
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,760
 But I will say that especially Korean science fiction seems

465
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,320
 to be having a real moment in Anglo-speaking countries at the moment,

466
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,640
 like, 'cause Squid Game, I think, did a lot to promote Korean.

467
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,360
 Especially, I suppose not necessarily in books.

468
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,760
 I haven't seen much by Korean authors outside of Clark's World,

469
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,880
 which has done a lot of Korean translation.

470
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,200
 But certainly in terms of, like, film and TV, this interesting.

471
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,360
 So yeah, I wonder whether this is the effect of Squid Game,

472
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,720
 which I really liked.

473
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
 I'm looking forward to watching The Movie.

474
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,000
 And this year sees the youngest ever Hugo finalist.

475
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,920
 Yes.

476
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,720
 So congratulations to Laurel Iester, who is nominated in Best Fan Artist,

477
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,640
 and is the youngest ever Hugo finalist, the Hugo nerds tell me.

478
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,240
 I feel a bit aggrieved about this because back in the day,

479
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,840
 when Plochtogot all its nominations,

480
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,680
 it was not custom and practice to put everyone who was

481
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,240
 a major part of the process of getting the fanzine together

482
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,880
 on the list for the Hugo.

483
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,760
 So Plochtogot just had the three main editors

484
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,360
 and not the rest of the team.

485
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,400
 But we were very much a team, and that included two babies and a cat.

486
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,840
 One of my children would have been the youngest ever Hugo finalist.

487
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,440
 And then we'd have had to argue whether cats can be Hugo finalists.

488
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,520
 I think probably they shouldn't be, I think, that was bad.

489
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,360
 But we could not have done the fanzine without them.

490
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,000
 I think that's everything on Hugo's.

491
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,320
 Is that everything on Hugo's?

492
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,600
 Yeah, and I think I have any good, very happy,

493
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,360
 do we say that pretty already?

494
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,960
 Pinnings, we said that several times, I think.

495
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,760
 Oh no, I have one more thing, tiny thing.

496
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,960
 It's a new category for me, collecting categories.

497
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,680
 I'm not as good as Sean and Maguire, who I think has just picked up a sixth.

498
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,480
 The Hugo nerds will tell us.

499
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,600
 I'm excited to read the fanzine.

500
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,840
 I had not realized she had done a fanzine.

501
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,480
 It's very rare that something comes up on the fanzine ballot that I had not,

502
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,040
 like, any idea about, and so I am excited.

503
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,760
 It's also fiction.

504
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,440
 Quite unusual for fiction fanzines to get on the ballot.

505
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,480
 Yes, no, and it's also very rare that fiction...

506
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,120
 Congratulations, Sean and...

507
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,280
 And yeah, I think that's a fifth category.

508
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,640
 But anyway, so it's my best fan cast as my second category, and I am very excited.

509
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,920
 Probably the sixth, isn't it?

510
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,000
 Because I bet she's been in every single short fiction and long fiction category.

511
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,320
 Oh, no, plus and series.

512
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,920
 And series, but and best-related work.

513
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,200
 So it's probably seven.

514
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
 Yeah, no, so she's been nominated in novel novella.

515
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,800
 I assume she's been nominated in novel yet, but that is an assumption.

516
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,520
 Short story, best-related work, best series, and best fanzine.

517
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,720
 Don't do a fan cast, Sean.

518
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,680
 She, oh no, she was.

519
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,160
 She won for fan cast in the first three years of the categories and all gradients.

520
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,840
 She was on SF's Quee cast.

521
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,320
 Sean and his clearly tried to get the entire set.

522
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,000
 I mean, I respect that.

523
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,400
 But no, yes, she won with Paul Cornell and other authors who temporarily escaped me for

524
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,160
 SF's Quee cast way back in the start of the fan cast category.

525
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,560
 They had a run of wins.

526
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,200
 Also, we forgot best graphics story.

527
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,440
 So...

528
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,000
 So how is that?

529
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
 Nellie?

530
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,800
 I love count.

531
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,520
 It's a lot.

532
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,080
 It's a lot.

533
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,520
 Yeah, sure.

534
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,640
 And if you're listening, do write in.

535
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,520
 But congratulations for your nominations this year, especially for the Wayward Children series,

536
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,720
 because I do love those books.

537
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,200
 I was going to say on the Hugo's, I think it is nice to see that there are categories

538
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,640
 where there are people who have been nominated for who were nominated again and have all done

539
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,040
 good work.

540
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,240
 But it is nice to see a few new people popping into each category, particularly, I think

541
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,800
 there are three first-time nominees in Best Fan Writer this year.

542
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,960
 Chris Barkley, Bito Corrala, and Alex Brown, the new people in Fan Artist, the new people

543
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,760
 in Fanzine.

544
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,880
 As we just said, we are new people in Fancast.

545
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,600
 I think it's nice to see a little bit of turnover in some of these categories where you can have

546
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,360
 some of the same nominees year after year, and sometimes they're very good work,

547
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,160
 but it's nice to see other people getting nominated as well.

548
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,200
 I think that's right.

549
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,880
 I've to thought, Podcast Corner, I've been listening to Podcasts again.

550
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,520
 And the podcast I've been listening to specifically is the Life Writing Podcast,

551
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,400
 which comes from the team of Tana Reeve-Doo and Stephen Barnes, who are a husband and wife

552
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,760
 writing team, and they have started a podcast where they give writing advice, they have interviews,

553
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
 they are, and the reason I like it is, one, they have a very good rapport, as you would expect,

554
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,480
 because they know each other so well, but that also carries over to their interviews,

555
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
 where they obviously have great rapport with their interviewees.

556
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,640
 And it is very much focused on writing, but I think a lot of the stuff they discuss and the

557
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,840
 advice they give kind of applies to writing, but also to your non-writing life, and it's very

558
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,400
 applicable to that.

559
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,920
 And I would say Stephen Barnes in particular has some very insightful questions.

560
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,960
 So I've been listening to that and enjoying that recently.

561
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,440
 Cool.

562
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,160
 Thank you, Liz.

563
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,520
 No, and I think that sounds like a very good idea for a podcast.

564
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,920
 So, hurrah.

565
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,440
 It does sound good.

566
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,640
 I mean, I listened to it because they had an interview with Brian Fuller, who I love of Hannibal,

567
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,880
 and Pushing Gaze's, and Star Trek fame.

568
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,920
 Yes, yes, fair enough.

569
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:29,040
 In an excellent demonstration of how timely we are, we're going to pick up on the Brandon Sanderson

570
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:37,920
 Kickstarter, which launched a few weeks ago, and which has rapidly become the most funded

571
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
 project on the platform.

572
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,760
 So yes, what do we think about this, Alison and Liz?

573
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,440
 Well, first of all, I want to thank Alex Holden.

574
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,280
 Mr. Holden makes exceedingly good concertinas for suggesting this topic.

575
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,200
 So it's quite a funny Kickstarter video.

576
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
 I'm sure everybody who listens to this podcast has already heard about it now,

577
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,920
 but if you haven't, go and stop the podcast now.

578
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,920
 Go watch the Kickstarter video, which is quite funny, and we're going to spoil it now, so then

579
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,560
 you can come back.

580
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,440
 He basically said, "I have to confess something."

581
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,520
 There's a lot of lockdown professionals, and the thing I am confessing is that I accidentally wrote

582
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,120
 four extra novels in lockdown.

583
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,360
 He actually wrote five, but there are four in the Kickstarter, and the Kickstarter is a new way to

584
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,360
 buy novels by Brandon Sanderson, and you can also pay extra money.

585
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,240
 If you don't just want a load of novels from Brandon, you can also get a load of extra things,

586
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,440
 like I don't know, T-shirts and other merchandise objects, and it's all secret, so you can get like

587
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:50,000
 a Brandon Sanderson subscription box arriving in your post every week month,

588
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,280
 I don't think it's a month, and they did $41 million.

589
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,960
 I mean, I'm not sure.

590
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,920
 I want a subscription box from anyone once a month, and if I think about who I might want one for,

591
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,760
 none of the people that come to mind are science fiction authors, so yeah.

592
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,680
 But on this topic, if you're interested in an octa-thaw-once-a-month subscription box,

593
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,040
 do let us know.

594
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,800
 It will contain a piece of weterbicks and a ribbon every month until we run out of weterbicks and

595
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,240
 ribbons. Look, you can get different flavours of weterbicks.

596
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,080
 Yeah, but we're not going to be putting that level of effort in this and please disregard Liz's

597
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,920
 attempt to make this more interesting.

598
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,560
 Sorry, I mean, you could get-

599
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,160
 You could get different flavours of weterbicks.

600
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,960
 Weterbicks comes in two flavours which are weterbicks and abominations.

601
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
 Okay, so the month's Alison is in charge of the box.

602
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,680
 You get original weterbicks only, and the month's Alison is in charge of the box.

603
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,920
 Do you get weterbicks abomination?

604
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
 Liz, do you have any thoughts about this?

605
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,240
 Yes, so I thought it was very interesting because I saw the numbers going up on the kickstarter,

606
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,240
 but I would never imagine it would get to $41 million.

607
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,760
 So I'm just going to set again, because I need to set a few times for it to sink in.

608
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,680
 $41 million, but I think it's very interesting.

609
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,320
 So Brandon Sanderson has written a very long blog post about it, which we will link to.

610
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,320
 But I think some of the main issues are that it's clear that Brandon Sanderson-

611
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,520
 it is not just Brandon Sanderson himself getting $1.41 million.

612
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,760
 This is Brandon Sanderson essentially using these $41 million to be his own

613
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,040
 Brandon Sanderson publishing house in a way.

614
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,240
 And it's clear that what he wants is partly to see if they could do this,

615
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,520
 but also to show that for him there is a viable option,

616
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,680
 you know, should Amazon, which represents the lion's share of his sales, go away.

617
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,040
 And also it's to demonstrate to his publishers that actually there is an appetite,

618
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,800
 you know, an appetite for buying things in these different formats,

619
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,400
 because you know, it is $41 million, but he has 23,000 people who pledged $500,

620
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,120
 you know, to get the swag boxes and all the premium hardbacks and the audiobooks and the ebooks.

621
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,160
 You know, so clearly there is a significant market of people out there who just want

622
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,960
 the ebooks from him, but also a large chunk of people who are happy to pay extra for things like

623
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,480
 premium hardcover books and signed premium hardcover books.

624
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,720
 And I think it really shows that there is an appetite for books from him.

625
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,360
 Okay, I'm going to bring us a box of weirderbicks to sign.

626
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:23,120
 So I think this is really interesting because I think there are, especially in the pandemic,

627
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,040
 there is a growing awareness that a lot of the people whose media I consume are very precarious,

628
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,960
 and this is something I've been noticing, especially in the podcasting scene,

629
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,680
 but I imagine it also extends to authors, which is that like as kind of,

630
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,040
 especially in podcasting, as advertising money has been drying up during COVID,

631
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,680
 many of them have been moving towards models where you can support them directly.

632
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,560
 And I do think that what we're seeing here is a lot of people who are like, well,

633
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,040
 Brandon Sanderson is my favorite author by a very long way,

634
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,240
 and this is a way that I can both support him and get loads of swag.

635
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,160
 I can't get anywhere else into the deal.

636
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,240
 And there are quite a few podcasts I support where I'm like, I could not support them.

637
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,640
 Like, I don't necessarily need to, but I like supporting them and like getting the exclusives

638
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,040
 is a nice kind of thing into the bargain.

639
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,280
 So I do wonder how many of the people supporting are just kind of huge fans who are keen to support

640
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,840
 him as an independent artist.

641
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,600
 I mean, that is true.

642
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,080
 Although I would say if you wish, like, if you're picking authors who you wish to support so that

643
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,240
 they can continue making a viable living at it, you probably wouldn't start with Brandon Sanderson,

644
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,080
 who is quite clear about his sales and so on on the blog posts.

645
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,040
 And he's saying that he sells 350,000 copies in week one of his books.

646
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,080
 So if you are supporting people, then Brandon Sanderson is probably not at the top of the list

647
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,960
 of people who are going to have a problem with the Kickstarter support.

648
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,640
 While that is true, I do pre-order.

649
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,480
 So like, there are authors I know who are not, who are kind of like mid-list authors who I love

650
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,400
 who are on support and I pre-order their books.

651
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,680
 But like, so one good example is Dan Moran, I pre-order all his books, but like, he does not

652
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,040
 have the ability to do this.

653
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,760
 So like, on the one hand, you wouldn't necessarily choose to do it with Sanderson, but on the other

654
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,840
 hand, like, it's not like there were 20 Kickstarter's by a bunch of authors and I got to pick which one.

655
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,680
 And so that's part of the problem here.

656
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,960
 I think...

657
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,960
 Except that Sanderson was also slightly surprised by how successful this Kickstarter was.

658
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,920
 He was not expecting it to do $41 million and one of the ways they have given back.

659
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,280
 And I think this is very meritorious, really, is that they went, there's a video of this too

660
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,960
 that we can also put you the show notes.

661
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,320
 They went and backed every Kickstarter in the publishing category on Kickstarter,

662
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,760
 as a way of saying thank you.

663
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,160
 So there are probably, I'm certain that there are a lot of very small authors whose life is

664
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,480
 precarious, who got a little bit more money because Braddison D'Sonderson A) went and

665
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,400
 supported them, and B) did a video about it so that his 350,000 followers, or however many,

666
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,480
 will all have gone and seen all of those other Kickstarter's in the publishing category and they

667
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,120
 will also have got some love, I should think.

668
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,400
 So I mean, I basically think Braddison D'Sonderson is a jolly good egg.

669
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,800
 I was a bit worried that Tor might be very upset by all of this, but apparently Tor are quite thrilled,

670
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,200
 I have been told not by the way anyone at Tor.

671
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,280
 Tor believes that the people who backed this Kickstarter are often going to go and buy Braddison D'Sonderson's

672
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,200
 backlist, which is all on Tor.

673
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:27,120
 - If you are someone who, yeah, if you're publishing things that have Braddison D'Sonderson written on them,

674
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,520
 you must have been quite happy that Braddison D'Sonderson was in the news a lot for the last six weeks.

675
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,040
 That's gotta be reflecting well on your bottom line as well as on everyone else's.

676
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,200
 - I should probably read some Sondison, but I feel like I've always thought everything about it

677
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,680
 is maybe think it's the sort of thing I absolutely hate.

678
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
 - You would hate it, yeah, correct.

679
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,240
 - Yeah, okay.

680
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,520
 - I won't then, but it seems like a really nice bloke in lots of ways.

681
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,440
 - What I hate it, John.

682
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,560
 - I don't know.

683
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,360
 You like some things, but you don't like other things and I sometimes find it difficult to predict

684
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,520
 which edge of the line you'll be on.

685
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,040
 - True of most predictions.

686
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:07,120
 - Basically, if you want to read a series of 10 novels which comprise 2 million words,

687
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,200
 Alison, then I may have misjudged your taste in literature,

688
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,880
 because I think that sounds like what you would like is all of that character development and

689
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,680
 plot to be in a tight 40,000 word novella.

690
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,560
 And I don't know how you'd achieve that, but I think that's what you'd want.

691
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,480
 - I'd want you to not have any extraneous words.

692
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,560
 He also has very good advice.

693
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:34,720
 He does stuff about how to write and how to do hard things that is very interesting because he

694
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,640
 repudiates the notion that writers are people who cannot do anything else but write,

695
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,800
 and he is a big fan of the notion that if you want to be a science fiction writer,

696
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,960
 you should sit down and write every day.

697
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,200
 And I would endorse that sort of approach to doing anything that is hard.

698
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,400
 And I think he's, so I think his advice on how to become good at things is also,

699
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,320
 is also quite good.

700
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,920
 So clever boy.

701
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,880
 And he's also very rich now, which is nice.

702
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,680
 I guess he runs a bit organization big enough to have an HR director.

703
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,560
 Is that what you said, Liz?

704
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,320
 - Yes, he's basically got, I mean, to fulfill this Kickstarter,

705
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,280
 he's basically going to have a small publishing outfit that he runs.

706
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,160
 So yes, I think the 41 million is, he's going to do well off it,

707
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,560
 but it's also going to be split a lot of ways,

708
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,360
 I mean, essentially funding a small company from it.

709
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,000
 - Well, and also, I think, like, his stated reasons in his blog post

710
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,240
 is like to try and reduce the dominance that Amazon has on his career,

711
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,440
 as Liz was mentioning earlier.

712
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:48,160
 And there's also the potential that if his publishing venture goes well enough for him,

713
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,480
 he might start being able to sort of publish things by kind of other authors.

714
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,320
 And so this is potentially very exciting.

715
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,800
 And in general, I think it's also quite exciting that the biggest Kickstarter of all time

716
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,440
 is for a bunch of books and book-related merchandise in our genre.

717
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,680
 That is, I think, a huge thing that I'm very excited about,

718
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,680
 because it shows that there's potentially a lot of life there,

719
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,480
 and it's just nice to be in a scene that is kind of growing and has enthusiasm.

720
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,520
 And I think this Kickstarter shows that those things are true.

721
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,000
 And yeah, I think Sanderson increasing the profile of our little slice of life

722
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,360
 can only be a good thing, said like a true optimist.

723
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,040
 - Yeah, it's particularly good, because some of the other biggest

724
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,560
 Kickstarter of all time are for vaporware nonsense.

725
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,880
 So, I mean, I'm fairly sure Bradessad and Sanderson will actually deliver on his Kickstarter.

726
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
 - That is the other thing.

727
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,760
 Like, this isn't the laser shaving blade.

728
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,120
 I mean, full disclosure, I don't think any of us back the Kickstarter.

729
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,000
 I'm just going to buy the ebooks when they come out in the shops.

730
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,920
 - Yeah, I thought about buying the e-book one, actually, but I'll probably just get the ebooks.

731
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,960
 If I decide I like Bradessad and Sanderson by then, which I probably won't.

732
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,160
 - I mean, to be fair, I'll probably just borrow them from the library, but, you know.

733
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:13,840
 - Let's do picks.

734
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:21,680
 - My pick is Arosums Universal Robots, which is, of course, the play from 1921 by Carl Schappec,

735
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,360
 that in veg is the word "robots" though the robots in the play are not, in fact,

736
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,440
 robots in the way that we normally think about them because they are grown from flesh in a

737
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,720
 rather horrible way.

738
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,240
 My picks not the play itself, which is problematic in a few ways, but the new Radio 4 production of

739
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,760
 it on Radio 4's play for today, I guess, but I'd play for this week anyway, or now I think they

740
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,320
 just go, "Well, we've got a podcast that we put plays in it."

741
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,920
 But this isn't Octa-Thought podcast corner because radio shows and radio shows and

742
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
 podcasts and podcasts are very different.

743
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:55,120
 Anyway, it is a Radio 4 production where they have dealt with the problematic nature of this

744
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,240
 play by making it a musical comedy.

745
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,080
 And it's quite good.

746
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,120
 And it's the first episode was "Come to Days ago" and it's on Radio 4, and we will put a link

747
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,080
 in the show notes.

748
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,520
 And then I think the next one's later today, and I think it might only be a two-part

749
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,440
 production, but it's actually very hard to tell on the BBC website whether it's two parts or

750
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,080
 seven parts, and they should think about that.

751
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:22,240
 BBC, if you're listening, we could tell you a thing or two about producing audio shows.

752
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,800
 Not really.

753
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,840
 I think this ego nomination has gone to your head here, Alison.

754
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,720
 But I really like it.

755
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,280
 Rossims Universal Robots, and it's good stuff.

756
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,000
 It's on BBC Sound, so it might be available worldwide.

757
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,160
 Yeah, and this is on BBC Sound, so if you have access to that, you can get it there.

758
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,920
 My pick is a book, and it may even tie an unexpectedly to our Brandon Sanderson discussion.

759
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,760
 So my pick is a book called "Based Notes" by Lara Elaina.

760
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:59,120
 Donne Lee, and it is about Vic, a perfumer who has discovered the secret of making perfumes,

761
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:05,360
 which will perfectly recreate a memory for the person who experienced that memory.

762
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,720
 So essentially you sniff this scent and you experience a perfect recreation of a memory.

763
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,360
 The catch is that in order to do this, one of the ingredients for the perfume has to be taken

764
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,280
 from the dead body of one of the people in the memory.

765
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,440
 So it is essentially about Vic, who is, you know, so the protagonist throughout this book is a

766
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,200
 serial killer. They have murdered multiple people and will go on to kill more.

767
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,640
 So it is quite, you know, it's quite dark, it's quite depressing from that sense.

768
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:44,080
 And I have to enjoy the first part more where it is them meeting a bunch of people and kind of

769
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,800
 coming up with a plot for the latest perfume than from the latest stage of the book, which

770
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,400
 do involve basically a lot of killing, which escalates as like they've gone closer and closer

771
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,680
 to being discovered. But it's also, it's other aspect is it's all set in kind of, it's New York

772
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,160
 and it's, you know, Vic is a perfumer and the other people involved, you know, there's a barber,

773
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,000
 there's a kind of a bar tender and a tailor. And it is all about the sector of society who are

774
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,720
 kind of creative people who on the surface, into making a reasonable living, but really they're

775
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,320
 just sort of clinging, clinging on to being able to afford to have this life, to have an apartment,

776
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,320
 to be creative. And they are pitted against essentially a large, you know, business corporation

777
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,240
 that they get entangled with. And that's why they're making these perfumes, you know. So it's

778
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,280
 basically sort of like the precarious millennials and gensette of New York versus the big corporations

779
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,880
 who are basically destroying that. So I thought there was a really interesting angle to it. And

780
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:50,000
 it's a very like evocative book. It is full of descriptions of sense and how they are made and

781
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,440
 kind of everyone seems to be, you know, a lot of stuff is identified by Cent and it's clear that

782
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,360
 Vic has a real passion for perfume outside their other, you know, murderous inclinations. So I

783
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:05,600
 quite enjoyed it. There's a very famous book called Perfume by Patrick Susskind, which is about

784
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,480
 somebody who, well, it doesn't have the entire thing of this, but it has some of the features in common

785
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,600
 and everyone is kind of like, well, this is a novel that is not like any other novels. So,

786
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,880
 but this novel does sound like it might be a novel that's a bit like perfume.

787
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,280
 Yeah, so I have not read perfume, just looking up, it does sound like it could be

788
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,560
 a little bit similar or inspired by it. Yes. I mean, it's obviously quite different, but I mean,

789
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,520
 it feels like, I mean, obviously there's no new under the sun, but perfume is,

790
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,880
 it sounds like it might have been one of the antecedents for this book, one of the things that

791
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,040
 made the author think that this might be an interesting book to write. Yeah. And the other

792
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,520
 thing, when you were talking about it, it did sound like our hero is a creative New York

793
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:56,160
 professional who is clinging onto his lifestyle and is also a serial killer. And that's kind of odd.

794
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:06,640
 I am, can I have to look it up? It sounds cool. The protagonists of bass notes are no pronouns

795
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,640
 are ever used for them and their gender is kind of never, you know, it is never explicitly stated.

796
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,120
 There's kind of, you know, some comments on, you know, fitting, fitting suits to their shape and

797
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,880
 things like that, but it's never explicitly gender. But it's interesting because I noticed that when

798
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,600
 Alison replied to me, you said he, I think there's an assumption that serial, I'm very sorry,

799
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,720
 that's because historically 99% of serial killers are men. Exactly. I think there's an

800
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,480
 assumption, it was interesting that there is an assumption that serial killer novels are always

801
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,360
 about men. And in this case, it is, you know, really, really left ambiguous. And it's mentioned

802
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,840
 that they present in a very androgynous manner. So I thought that was very interesting.

803
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,440
 I had an argument with a friend once, because we read Scalzi's novel where Scalzi uses a similar

804
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,120
 trick, it's all in the first person. And the protagonist is never gendered by people they're

805
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,840
 talking to, she never know what gender they are. And the character was called Chris. And so my

806
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,720
 friends were like, oh, you know, he, this, he, that. And I said, oh, that's interesting, because

807
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,920
 like, you know, they're not gender, and they looked at me and they were like, oh, well, but that's

808
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,560
 not because we have underlying assumptions, it's because Chris is a boy's name. And I was like,

809
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,000
 your girlfriend is literally called Chris. So like, yeah, there is that.

810
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,800
 That's quite good. And that's actually really interesting. That makes me want to read it a whole

811
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,960
 bunch more. So it's going on the list. That is interesting. Especially it's interesting in the

812
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,400
 context of perfume, because for anyone who doesn't know, perfumes are one of the more gender things

813
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,400
 in the world, and they're trying to, and have always been, it's not that they kind of went,

814
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,120
 or we can sell twice as much perfume if we, if we gender it is always been gendered.

815
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:54,000
 And so they're just trying now trying to find some gender neutral perfumes and doing it, I think,

816
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,680
 because you know, then they can sell three times the many perfumes. So they're quite happy with that.

817
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,040
 I will link to in the show notes, a regular view on tour.com by Lee Mandela that discusses

818
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,560
 some of the gender aspects in more detail. I thought it's very good.

819
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,000
 Cool. Thank you very much. Liz, my pick is Moon Knight.

820
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:20,400
 But it's not the Disney series. It is the six issue run, which was written by Warren Ellis,

821
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:29,520
 Declan Shelby, and Jordy Belair back in 2014 and 15. It is volume seven of Moon Knight, and it is

822
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,280
 a six issue run that Ellis wrote, and each issue is kind of a standalone story in a larger anthology.

823
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,120
 It was my sort of, it was my introduction to the character. I heard about the character first on

824
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,360
 the incomparable superhero, superhero tournament that they did one summer, which was nonsense and

825
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,520
 very fun, and I enjoyed very much. And Moon Knight got surprisingly far in that tournament.

826
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,360
 It made me laugh a lot, so I decided to seek him out. And this little trade paperback is very,

827
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:10,080
 very good. Unfortunately, it is on Amazon, 978 pounds and 99p for the paperback.

828
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:16,640
 But if you're willing to read it in electronic form, it's £3.90. And I recommend reading it

829
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,080
 electronically. I mean, apologies to anyone who likes physical books, but you know,

830
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:28,080
 it's not worth £1000, but it's just isn't. But it is definitely worth £3.19, and I would

831
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:36,480
 highly recommend going and looking it up. Is that the bit of Moon Knight that is forming the

832
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,720
 plot that they're nicking for the TV show, or is that going to be totally different?

833
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,560
 No, it's because it's not a single thread. It's sort of more of an anthology.

834
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,520
 Issue seven and onwards of that volume were written by a different author, and that was much more

835
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,720
 kind of traditional story. But I thought that was not quite as strong as the earlier bits.

836
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,960
 I've put a link in the show notes.

837
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,040
 So I can go and get it for £3.90.

838
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,840
 Yes, or you can subscribe to Marvel Unlimited. Marvel Unlimited is amazing. You pay $69 a year,

839
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,520
 and you get infinite comic comics. I read a lot of comics on Marvel Unlimited.

840
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:23,520
 Yeah, I had Marvel Unlimited for $1, lot of $69. And I basically bazed in comics for about

841
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,080
 three weeks and then realised that I was a bit fed up comics and never picked stuff again.

842
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,800
 So I need to... It's clearly something I just want to actually take for a month every so often.

843
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,520
 That was the Octa Thor podcast, and it's goodbye from me.

844
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:47,680
 It's goodbye from me. And it's goodbye from me.

845
00:43:47,680 --> 00:44:04,480
 So I feel like you're in the stage of life where you're still going.

846
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,840
 If I read two million words, if I read some people I like, and then there's two million words of it,

847
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,760
 that's two million words of stuff I like. And I'm in the stage of life where I go.

848
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,440
 I have X number of books left in my life and every single one of them has to add value all

849
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,880
 of the time. I mean, there are lots of long books. I mean, I don't... I would say I generally don't

850
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,240
 like long books, but the expanse. But I mean, I liked Anna Karenina a lot, and I'll talk about

851
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,520
 why. And I'll intend you to read War and Peace at some point. That's pretty long.

852
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,080
 Because Anna Karenina was so fantastic. My Latin teacher espoused all the things she liked about it,

853
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,600
 and she was like, "It's so good because Tolstoy, like you're exploring a convoy." And then he's like,

854
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,040
 "Oh, now I'm going to go over here and spend 100 pages telling you about this peasant." And I'm like,

855
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,920
 "Oh my God, no, that sounds awful." Tolstoy does go off topic. It is quite true.

856
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,480
 You're saying we are the Tolstoy of podcasts? I don't want anyone to think we're comparing

857
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:03,200
 ourselves favorably to Tolstoy. We do a better top podcast than Tolstoy ever did. I'm 99% satisfied.

858
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,040
 That's that. This is when you find out there's like,

859
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,560
 Wack Cylinders Alison, and he had like a weekly radio show. Weekly Cylinders Show.

860
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,000
 Okay, you're at your grasp of history. It's not great, is it? Wack Cylinders were around in the

861
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,920
 late 1800s and Tolstoy died in 1910. Okay, so maybe there is Tolstoy, Wack Cylinders, sorry.

862
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,520
 Is that did you do a podcast? I mean, write in listeners. If you're an expert in Tolstoy's podcasting

863
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:35,680
 career, please let us know. Tolstoy actually wrote letters by dictating them onto Wack Cylinders

864
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:42,560
 because he found it faster than writing. So he basically, he was the Christopher J. Garcia

865
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:48,080
 of his day. Look, look, look. I've got a link for the show notes. I mean, it's in Russian, but you

866
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,680
 know. Well, this is excellent. I wasn't expecting my offhand mention that Tolstoy might have done a

867
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:00,320
 podcast to go this way, but a rah. The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin
