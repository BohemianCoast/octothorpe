1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
 Oh, we've got a seam tune there! I forgot about the seam tune!

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,920
 Oh shoot, yeah, we have to do that.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,120
 We've got a seam tune?

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,200
 Ah, long story Liz, we'll tell you later.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
 Ha ha ha! In the vloggast!

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,120
 Did you get drunk and make a seam tune?

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,600
 No, it was in the morning and it was Carrie.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,120
 It was Anne de Graeben.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,040
 Anne Graeben.

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,320
 Shall we do it now?

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,320
 Hang on, yeah.

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,840
 Did you do do do do do, you find wherever I put it.

13
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,200
 It started with me going...

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,280
 Octa thought. Octa thought.

15
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,200
 Does whatever an octa thought does, which is like obviously classic,

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,560
 theme tune stuff, I'm a visionary.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,400
 And then people started filming in the chat of the zoom that we were in

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,320
 and Carrie posted.

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,760
 Octa thought. Octa thought.

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,120
 You can listen to us and talk.

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,440
 Anne de Jon, Anne list two.

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,760
 Octa thought is here for you.

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,560
 We discuss, we review on everything we have of you.

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,360
 Talking cons and talking fans, if it's Fandome Octa-Corkan.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,000
 Look how, here comes an octa thought.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
 And then Graeben says,

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,840
 Octa thought. Octa thought.

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,320
 Fourth dimensional space-time warp.

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,200
 And, and unfortunately at that point, we never finished the next verse because...

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,440
 Because of Pat McMurry.

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,280
 The podcast spent 15 minutes discussing whether

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,560
 Thorpe rhymes with warp or not.

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,440
 And Thorpe, Thorpe absolutely rhymes with warp.

34
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,800
 This is my contention and I will take it to the grave.

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,560
 And I think it's fair to say that rhyming octa thought and warp

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,800
 is evidence that you're part of the cultural hegemony of the south of England.

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,880
 I'm from the east.

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,480
 The mysterious east.

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,000
 Pete, that's the first time Peterborough has ever been called the mysterious east.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,760
 Are you saying I'm from the south of England?

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,440
 Liz, say octa thought and warp.

42
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,200
 Octa thought, warp.

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
 This, this alright?

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,280
 Yeah.

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,440
 Yeah, so you're doing the thing where you put, you pronounce the R in warp.

46
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,280
 Warp. Warp.

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,720
 [Laughs]

48
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,480
 No, you're thinking of corn wool.

49
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,920
 Yeah, I'm not from corn wool.

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,880
 Warp.

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,360
 [Laughs]

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,240
 Warp.

53
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,680
 [Laughs]

54
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,360
 Anyway, all of these will be available on the Patreon OctaThop Soundboard coming real soon now.

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,000
 Thank you very much to everyone who is in that Zoom call for Filki long.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,400
 And if anyone has any suggestions for additions to the OctaThop theme tune in terms of verses,

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,120
 please do write in and let us know it's been too long since we did any poetry.

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
 But critically, if you're a filker and reading this,

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,160
 because I'm sure some of you are, if you'd like to work that up into an actual thing that we can use the theme song.

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,400
 500 episodes later we can still be playing it to the great annoyance of a certain proportion of alliculus.

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:59,120
 [Music]

62
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:08,080
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 43rd episode of OctaThop, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

63
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,560
 This episode is coming to you on the 28th of October 2021.

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
 I'm John Coxon.

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
 I'm Alison Scott.

66
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
 And I'm Liz Batty.

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,560
 And it's almost Halloween, so we're in a really spooky mood.

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,320
 Yep, I've got my pumpkin coloured microphone muffler on to celebrate the season.

69
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,640
 Are there any of you doing anything for Halloween?

70
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,320
 I think I might have, I think I might have a movie marathon on my own.

71
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,880
 I have got a pumpkin dremel.

72
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,080
 Oh.

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,720
 So yes, I am going to be carving a pumpkin this year because I didn't cover pumpkin last year because

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,440
 there wasn't really Halloweeny stuff that needed pumpkins.

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,120
 So I decorated my windows instead so that children could stand outside and look at them

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
 in a non-contact way.

77
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,960
 But this year we're going to have a pumpkin and we're going to wear masks while we dish out the

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,600
 candy because that's the thing you could do on Halloween at nobody's sixth word.

79
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,960
 Yeah, we might dress up.

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,680
 We'll be doing the candy and we will be carving a pumpkin.

81
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,600
 It used to be tradition when I was an undergraduate that we would marathon the

82
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,720
 saw movies on Halloween and I might do that again this year because there's a new saw movie

83
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,920
 out which I haven't watched yet.

84
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,640
 I mean the problem is now that there are nine saw movies when we launched this tradition

85
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,440
 there are only four.

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
 It was easier back then.

87
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,600
 Could you just like pick three random saw movies and binge them?

88
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:31,760
 No.

89
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,120
 Okay.

90
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,080
 Can we have this talk?

91
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,320
 Are the saw movies good?

92
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,440
 You wouldn't like them.

93
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,480
 I don't think.

94
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,520
 No, just checking.

95
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
 I like them a great deal.

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,080
 I quite like that.

97
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,440
 I think the first one is good.

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,480
 The third one is the most critically well received but it's also the worst so I don't

99
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,520
 really know what that means.

100
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,160
 Your critical faculties are on tilt which we knew in fact.

101
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,320
 I think I saw the first one and it does involve someone doing something with a hacksaw

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,400
 to themselves which I did not enjoy so I will not be watching saw movies and also trick or

103
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,440
 treating is not a huge thing and you know you can't trick or treat me.

104
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
 I live inside an apartment building and the only pumpkins we've got are green

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,040
 so they would be slightly non-traditional pumpkins if I tried to carve one.

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,840
 Nice.

107
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,600
 And I don't have a pumpkin dremel.

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,200
 I mean I have actually there was one year when I thought about carving a watermelon

109
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,200
 because pumpkins had disappeared from the shops at the point where I wanted to cover pumpkin.

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,680
 Carver papaya.

111
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
 Less additional but they are orangey so.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,920
 I can think of a number of reasons why this is a terrible terrible idea.

113
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,600
 Try carving a peach.

114
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,280
 Just get a very unright very large peach you'll be right.

115
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,200
 Like a giant peach maybe.

116
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,360
 Yeah I'm like John is this this is not this is like the plot of a children's book I think

117
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
 rather than actual real life.

118
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,120
 John and the giant peach.

119
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,080
 I mean all I'm saying is it could work if you squint a bit.

120
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,480
 Okay so all of you people who haven't actually made a habit of carving fruit vegetables

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,200
 it kind of needs to be something of the squash family.

122
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:13,360
 Like a pumpkin or a melon and not a peach not stone fruit or whatever papayas are.

123
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
 Yeah crucially it needs to not have a stone in the middle right.

124
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,200
 I mean if you want to put a light in it then you need to be able to hollow it out and so

125
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,400
 you know you're not going to be hollowing out a pomegranate I should say.

126
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,000
 You could hollow out you could hollow out a papaya I think because they've got kind of like seeds in the middle.

127
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,360
 Yeah but but but the problem with papaya is going to be that that it doesn't have enough structural

128
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440
 integrity to to whack it with a dremel.

129
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,160
 If you don't believe me then google I carved a papaya with a dremel videos of the um.

130
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,000
 No I mean what we're going to do is Liz is going to do it and video herself and that

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,560
 that is going to go up on YouTube like come on.

132
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,520
 I do not own a dremel.

133
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,160
 This is even better if you do google papaya carving it is actually even better than pumping

134
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,880
 carving it is like ornamental fruit carving.

135
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,080
 Yeah that's because yeah maybe I'll learn to do that instead of the dremel one.

136
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
 That's so pretty.

137
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400
 Yes do a scary one.

138
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,080
 They are pretty yeah no okay apparently you can carve papayas and that's amazing.

139
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,600
 Yeah brilliant.

140
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,560
 All right well I know what I'm doing for for Halloween.

141
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,120
 I need for papaya and a very sharp knife.

142
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
 And it's a Thai thing apparently.

143
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,640
 Yeah it's fruit carving.

144
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,120
 So I was totally wrong and in fact papaya carving a papaya is something you can do.

145
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
 I admit I made a mistake.

146
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,800
 Right click that out John.

147
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,480
 That's going to be the episode title yeah.

148
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,040
 Good excellent.

149
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,960
 Before we go into let us a comment a reminder to everyone that we are doing

150
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,840
 Octa Thorpe live at Novicon at 1pm on Sunday.

151
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,080
 This will be episode 45.

152
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,960
 So come along and shout things at us.

153
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,680
 I would like to state that a correspondent in Discord, one mr Andrew Hogg did call it

154
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
 forkeda thought live.

155
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,920
 Does that work?

156
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,480
 F-folk to Thorpe.

157
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,440
 F-folk to Thorpe yes like it's not quite full octa Thorpe.

158
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,000
 Hogg also says I was replaced by an actor at some point after seeing the ZZ9AGM video

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
 and Andrew January said that he's approaching that point where he's not confident he's ever

160
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,200
 known what John looks like.

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,160
 So yeah I'm glad to have sown confusion and doubt.

162
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,760
 We got a letter of comment.

163
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,800
 Yay.

164
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,280
 From Chris Garcia.

165
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,320
 Hey.

166
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,480
 Who says it was another good episode and one that provided an eye opener.

167
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
 Alison lived in America.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,400
 Does she still know the secret handshake?

169
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,640
 Alison do you still know the secret handshake?

170
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,440
 No.

171
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,960
 Don't.

172
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,120
 Well that was less funny than I was expecting.

173
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,840
 Yeah sorry.

174
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,560
 Stimulance not yet coursing through my veins.

175
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,840
 Right.

176
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,760
 I mean I know that I've had several days to think of a funny repost.

177
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,120
 Have another go.

178
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,520
 Chris says Alison lived in America.

179
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,680
 Does she still know the secret handshake?

180
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,760
 Yes but it's not a handshake.

181
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,560
 Oh.

182
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,680
 Is that better?

183
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,840
 It's got an air of mystery about it.

184
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,200
 Interesting.

185
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,560
 He also says that the next drink tank is all about Lego and I should write about the Lego club.

186
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
 And instead of writing about the Lego club I've told you all that he said I should.

187
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,440
 Nailed it.

188
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,920
 We also got a tweet of comment from Richard Bradshaw who tweeted a link to

189
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,960
 a itinerary for traveling from London to Thailand and Liz responded.

190
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,760
 Yes so crucially there is currently one missing link which is basically you can get as far as

191
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,080
 either the Chinese border or Hanoi but there's no direct train links at the moment through any

192
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,840
 of the countries that border Thailand to the north and east and west but it looks like they're

193
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,960
 going to open a railway from Vientiane and Lao to coming in China which means that missing

194
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,560
 link will be solved and it will be feasible to take a train I think all the way from Bangkok

195
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,800
 and go all the way around through China, Russia, Mongolia if you want to you know and then from

196
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,080
 Moscow you can get a train to Paris then from Paris you can get the train to London and you'd

197
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,920
 be sorted you could in fact come all the way to Novakom on the train but you'd have to start like now.

198
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,040
 So my first question was but can you do it in 80 days bearing in mind the location of the

199
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,280
 international state line and my open brackets spoiler for a novel published in 18 um tm.

200
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,520
 Secondly it would be really funny if it turns out the difficulty with getting from Bangkok to

201
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,960
 Buxton by public transport was in fact the terrible train service to Buxton which would not be

202
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:05,200
 impossible. We also heard from Alibaba and Sea Dave and Androsin on Facebook you too can comment

203
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,840
 on Facebook if you join the Optorpe Facebook group there's a link in the show notes. You also have

204
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,600
 to sell your soul to Mark Zuckerberg which you might not want to do and if you don't do that we

205
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,040
 are available on another a number of other fine platforms that are not owned by Facebook. Yes so

206
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,560
 Anne said in response to um my discussion of the hit checkers guide books I had as a kid which had

207
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,480
 the four covers you could arrange it for different ways she said I have those book covers but not

208
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,280
 the box if it was a box set which is typical rosin behaviour uh don't worry and I don't think

209
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,360
 they came in a box that was it.

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,040
 A couple of conventions have announced their covid policies in what is rapidly becoming a

211
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,880
 feature of octa thought in the covid policy roundup it's the covid policy roundup it's the covid

212
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:06,160
 policy roundup. The octa thought covid policy roundup. Like my jointly tuned um yes so smothcon has

213
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,480
 announced their covid policy and Alison is going to tell us about it. So smothcon we're waiting

214
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,120
 apparently until Portugal updated covid regulations on the first of October which a lot of countries

215
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,840
 have. So as of the first of October in Portugal mask wearing at conferences is mandatory

216
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,320
 mask wearing in bars and restaurants is not required digital certification of vaccination is

217
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,600
 required by bars but not hotels or restaurants. Smothcon is doing all of that plus they're

218
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,280
 additionally ensuring good social distancing and ventilation in their program spaces.

219
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,040
 All members need to either be vaccinated before attending or have written to the convention

220
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,440
 to tell them they're not vaccinated so they can arrange to give them a test on arrival and at any

221
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,200
 rate everybody has to come to the convention having either had a recent lateral flow test

222
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,360
 and or have some evidence of having had that or take a lateral flow test they'll have lateral

223
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,600
 flow tests on reception to test everyone they're going to have sanitation stations. Portugal has

224
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,000
 a strong uptake of vaccination and has 70% of the population vaccinated. I don't know if that's

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,880
 70% of adults or 70% of the entire population which sounds pretty good if it is. Yeah Portugal

226
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,320
 has astonishingly high vaccination rates isn't it? That's like tick vg isn't it? I mean that's what

227
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,160
 you want. Yeah yeah no it sounds good. Well I do have a sorry I have a question when they say that

228
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:38,320
 you need a digital covid pass to get into bars do we know what that entails? It's the EU parcel the

229
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,560
 NHS pass I think. I've seen something because prior to the first October I was worried that my NHS

230
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,920
 pass would not do for me but in fact in practice I believe that carrying everything on paper also

231
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,600
 works perfectly well in Portugal people say. Okay but obviously not all countries have a

232
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,400
 vaccination certificate that will work in Portugal. Yes I have a digital vaccination certificate but

233
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,480
 it is not interoperable with the EU digital covid pass so I assume there is some wiggle room there.

234
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,240
 You're not coming to Smofcon though are you? No but I could feasibly come to Smofcon.

235
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
 Yeah so I think there are people coming to Smofcon from around the world and I think it would be

236
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,960
 interesting to see what happens there but obviously Portugal doesn't want to trash its

237
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:27,600
 conference trade from the United States so they'll be doing something. Yes! Alongside Smofcon

238
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:35,680
 core flu concord has released their covid policy in PR5 and they'll be linked in the show notes.

239
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,280
 So basically as far as I could tell they are saying that masks double vaccination and regular

240
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,400
 thorough hand washing are not compulsory but very strongly encouraged. They say also that

241
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,160
 Novacons guidance is excellent and they've reprinted it and Novacons are saying that members should

242
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,080
 be vaccinated where possible so yeah I guess basically do what Novacons says and then go to

243
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,880
 core flu. I'm kind of like what I really require of these things it should probably less than John

244
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:11,440
 does is that conventions have a policy and publicise it and obviously we slightly prefer more

245
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,320
 stringent policies but actually the important thing is having is that the committee have thought

246
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
 about it and written something down and I'm quite glad that all of the conventions that I'm going

247
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,600
 to in the next few weeks have got these hopefully I won't catch covid whilst gallivanting around the

248
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,280
 world. I mean it's a bit like a code of conduct in that my minimum is that I require one but I do

249
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,480
 have slightly higher standards than that for what I would expect to see in it but mostly I want

250
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,280
 you to have one and have thought about it. Yes core flu is a very small convention though and in fact

251
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,560
 all three of these conventions are quite small so Eastacon we're looking at you to set standards here.

252
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:56,160
 Yeah Novacon full? Novacon are I believe close to full. They're closing memberships on the 9th of

253
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,400
 November you're not going to be able to buy memberships if you rock up on the day that will not be

254
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:10,960
 possible. I believe last time I looked at the membership list they're coming up on 250 members

255
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,400
 and I don't have a feel for how many people usually go to Novacon but I have a hunch that is

256
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,120
 towards the top end of attendance. Yeah they're at 254 members at the moment. Yeah that's quite high

257
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,680
 for an Novacon for but it's because it's Novacon 50 they were always expecting it to be a big one.

258
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,560
 I don't think it's just that though I think it's also because it's the first

259
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:38,960
 in-person convention in the UK like four. That's not core flu. Oh fancy come. Novacon's the first

260
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,080
 general science fiction invention that's not not specific I think that's a better way to say it

261
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,120
 apart from BristolCon. No because BristolCon's the one day con. So Novacon is the first full weekend

262
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,040
 general science fiction convention. I think Novacon will probably be the biggest that will have been

263
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,960
 held for a while so I don't think fancy con was 250 people. If they have 250 people at anything

264
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:10,320
 I think that will be bigger. Anyway yes so we will link to the core flu covid policy in the show notes.

265
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:20,240
 Core flu has 69 members. Nice of whom I think about 50 are attending so it is much smaller than

266
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,040
 Novacon. Yeah it'll get some more at the last minute and we have some Americans flying over

267
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:31,920
 which is quite nice so there's going to be a nice small international fancy focused crowd for

268
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:45,200
 core flu and that sounds pretty good to me. This episode of OctaThop is sponsored by Stoshirts.

269
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,040
 Here we are in the season of mists mellow fruitfulness in-person super spreader events and holiday

270
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,400
 planning and what better than to get unusual shirts, mugs and other paraphernalia with

271
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,200
 fanish and nerdy themes from Stoshirts. Stoshirts designs are unique and targeted closely on the

272
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:11,360
 sorts of people who listen to OctaThop. I for instance have a punctuation hoodie which keeps me warm

273
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:20,320
 at times of year when it is not as warm for instance in a minute. Admittedly I bought it in the summer

274
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,240
 and so I haven't really been able to test it but I'm assuming it will work because it is a hoodie.

275
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:34,160
 You can visit octaThop.stoshirts.com for a carefully curated range of goodies including our own

276
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,760
 OctaThop merchandise by which we mean we have a t-shirt and you can use secret code OctaThop

277
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:49,600

278
00:18:49,600 --> 00:19:09,040
 this. So we're going to talk today about guests of honour and how they're announced and

279
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:16,320
 I thought we were talking about bidding for Eastercons and Worldcons so there is a tradition

280
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,200
 amongst traditional science fiction conventions by which I mean really Eastercons and Worldcons

281
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,200
 and conventions in that vein where there is a bidding process and you might not be the seated

282
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,280
 convention of not announcing your guests of honour until you are until you have won the bid

283
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,200
 so that people who are voting for you do not know who you are planning to have as guests and that

284
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,160
 cannot form part of the voting process. So the reason for doing this and the reason it's a tradition

285
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,440
 is that the conventions have argued that we're not having guests as some form of marketing strategy

286
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,880
 the guests are there because they're being honoured and as such if you give people the

287
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,080
 opportunity to vote on those guests it's not an honour they're kind of going oh do we like that

288
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,520
 person do we not like that person however that has a major downside as John will explain.

289
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,520
 So there is a there is a potential negative here which is obviously if everyone is very happy

290
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,080
 with your guests of honour then it works super well but if you have picked a guest of honour

291
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,200
 who is problematic for any reason then that can mean that when people find out who your guests of

292
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,400
 honour are they have concerns or issues and those can be concerns or issues around kind of the

293
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,200
 Me Too movement and Code of Conduct violations in Day Gone By but it can also be stuff like

294
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,080
 we saw with Discon 3 and Tony Vyskoff where she was uninvited as a guest of honour after it turned

295
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,560
 out that the Bayon boards had been involved to some extent in the January the 6th insurrection

296
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:53,040
 in the United States and so there is like a potential issue there and so it's kind of it's

297
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,240
 kind of there are I think good arguments that either one has its ups and its downs.

298
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,680
 Recently the astounding and the otherwise awards were renamed after it was realised that there

299
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,320
 were potential issues with the people for whom they were originally named and this has spilled

300
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,560
 over I think into discussions of guests of honour in recent times where there is a concern that

301
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,880
 honouring certain people might be problematic from certain angles. This is something that I think

302
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,960
 hasn't yet been addressed by the mode of keeping the guests of honour secret until the bid wins

303
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,560
 because it means that any problems with the guest of honour also can't be challenged as part of the

304
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,800
 bid process and this is I think potentially an issue that hasn't yet been discussed in the genre

305
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,080
 and I think it is an issue that is going to be shortly addressed in the genre because of the

306
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:52,000
 current push towards trying to avoid honouring people who are who have problematic aspects.

307
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,560
 So okay so the problem here is that there are two ways of doing this one is to do your due

308
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,320
 jillindance before you invite people and say aha we want to invite this person to have any

309
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,000
 skeletons in their closet and ask around and people will tell you and then you make your judgments

310
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,640
 and if you say oh no we're going to invite them anywhere and in the case of Tony Wyscop that's

311
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,520
 what happened they knew perfectly well what people said about Tony they invited her anyway

312
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:30,480
 and then as a result of the insurrection part of which would be fermented in the spaces that Tony

313
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,800
 you know encouraged and didn't discourage they decided that position was untenable so it's not

314
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,880
 quite the same thing but they certainly knew about the issues at the point where she was invited that

315
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,160
 was part of the point um discon is in some respects a southern convention and that was a thing that

316
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,080
 they were doing I mean I think I have some so the problem is that the question is really do you want

317
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,200
 to do a thing where you go oh we're thinking of having so and so as a guest oh community tell

318
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,240
 us if they're good enough because that's essentially what you're saying and I kind of I kind of hate

319
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,800
 that idea I think if you're going to say we're honouring people then it is it is incumbent on

320
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,960
 you to make sure they're worthy of being honoured and then announce them and then follow through with

321
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,720
 that I think in practice you have to do your due diligence and decide what you're doing in private

322
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
 whether you announce them with the bid or you announce them with the con because if you announce

323
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,600
 if you announce your guests when you announce your bid then and people don't want them as a guest

324
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,280
 of honour then they will basically tell you why this person should not be honoured by your

325
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,280
 convention and then your choice is either to stick with them at which point the vote becomes not just

326
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,960
 a vote on the bid but a vote on the bid's guests which you know is is something we is something we

327
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,040
 could consider doing or you might be in a position where the bids are then saying well actually should

328
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,560
 we change our guest of honour mid-bids as some you know disinvite them as conventions have done

329
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,160
 so I think you kind of move you just kind of move the whole thing to an early affair

330
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,680
 but a phase where there is a potential for people to say actually we really dislike this decision

331
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,880
 you've made on guest of honour and therefore we are going to vote for the other bid and in a

332
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,720
 case where there isn't another bid people would then say actually we feel so strong about this we

333
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,400
 are going to mount a rival bid and I think I think there is an argument that that could be a desirable

334
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
 thing that you give people that that chance to vote but it also brings in the fact that people

335
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,800
 are then just going to vote for cons where they don't have a problem with the other bids guest of

336
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,000
 honour they just like this set of guests of honour more and then you do turn it into kind of a

337
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,920
 popularity contest between the different bids I think that's both the advantage and disadvantage

338
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,000
 of doing it that way which is firstly it means if you pick someone problematic who people do have

339
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,760
 a problem with they have some agency in pushing back against that that isn't asking you to uninvite

340
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,280
 the person and I remember at the time that Discon was uninviting Tony Allison and I had a big

341
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,320
 argument about whether or not that was acceptable I was very much on the side off they should disinvite

342
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,400
 her and Allison was very much on the side off you don't disinvite a guest once you've invited them

343
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,400
 and I think the problem with that is it's much easier if you if you are making the guests of honour

344
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
 part of the bidding process it means that if people don't like a guest they can vote against the bid

345
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,360
 and then the bid never has to disinvite someone the bid can be defeated and there's no issue of honour

346
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,680
 there but there's still a mechanism by which the guest of honour can be not honoured and it means

347
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,040
 the community can express opinions about problematic guests without asking conventions to go back on

348
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,400
 invitations which I think I think would be a positive the the negative obviously is like if

349
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,600
 you have a world con that announces like three local authors from the country that the world

350
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,920
 con is being held in or from the state that the world con is being held in all of whom are not

351
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,920
 quite as famous and then you have a world con that goes for massive like well-known global authors

352
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:58,400
 that is going to sway things and that would be I think a disadvantage and I think that is a difficult

353
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,080
 thing I don't know if I think either one is clearly better but I do wonder whether

354
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,280
 if we're not going to make the guests part of the bidding process convention bid committees need

355
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,360
 to think very carefully about what their procedure is should there become a problem with a guest

356
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,880
 after they've won and after that's been announced let me backtrack a bit when you say a problem with

357
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,560
 a guest clearly there's some cases where there are major problems with guests but there are also

358
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,320
 cases where what you actually have is a load of twitter people going off on one and we are

359
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,840
 too quick to say people going off on one on twitter without having thought through issues

360
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,640
 matter more than the considered opinions of people who have thought through the issues and

361
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,680
 come to a conclusion and we need to be much better about saying people's immediate reactions on

362
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,600
 twitter in some cases because somebody one person has fermented a row where they said get a thousand

363
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:02,000
 people to write in we make these knee-jerk reactions and actually if you took a step back you go well

364
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 you know yes in this case there is there is a case to answer here in this case maybe not

365
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,640
 but also how do we know because I think this business of judging the behavior of people of the past

366
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,840
 we have some cases where people did do all right things where we absolutely know they're problematic

367
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,560
 and we can look at them and go oh yes we would never we would never accept this thing now but we

368
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,800
 have other cases where we're actually it's just not that there's just not that much evidence people

369
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,480
 are just going off on one I think it's hard to discuss this without like going into the evidence

370
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,600
 and the merits of specific cases I mean I do agree that generally if something is on twitter it

371
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,440
 that a lot of people express very strong feelings about it very immediately and I think we've discussed

372
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,240
 before how that can kind of pressure cons also into taking very quick judgments because there is

373
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,840
 that pressure weighing down on them but I think in certain case it has been like the only route

374
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,400
 I'm going to bring up here Frank Miller who was invited to Thought Bubble this year as a guest

375
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,400
 and now Thought Bubble has no bid process it's just a convention and they announced their guests and

376
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,760
 they announced Frank Miller a lot of people said we would prefer Frank Miller as not a guest because

377
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,960
 of his extremely islamophobic works and it turned out that basically the person who brought this up

378
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,040
 had contacted Thought Bubble privately and nothing happened and so they were forced to take it public

379
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,440
 in order for something to happen so I think it is good that we we do have this route

380
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,440
 where people can bring public pressure especially if the convention seems unwilling to take their

381
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,640
 concerns seriously and the outcome of this is that Frank Miller has been

382
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,640
 disinvited as a guest which is something I think I would personally agree with

383
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,320
 I think I think that's a very good point which is if you don't have this being part of a bid

384
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,840
 process and obviously with Thought Bubble that wasn't something that would ever have happened

385
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,480
 but if you wait for it to be part of the convention there's an enormous amount of

386
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,240
 inertia on the sense of convention not to have to say oh we have goofed we're going to go back on

387
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,280
 that and one of the only ways to make that equation swing in the in the sense of because if you're

388
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,720
 a convention you've you've invited a guest disinviting them looks bad and so the only way for people

389
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,480
 to exert pressure is to make it look worse if they don't and that's where you get the big public

390
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,520
 things coming from and you see the same thing with with private companies like someone complains

391
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,520
 through the official customer service channels and nothing happens and then someone posts on

392
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,320
 Twitter and retweet starts happening and suddenly the company goes back on it and and so it and it

393
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,040
 is annoying it is annoying that that's how it works but I don't think it's necessarily

394
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,120
 I think it's very understandable why it ends up working like that quite often and I think it's

395
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,840
 all to do with kind of perception and pride and and sort of those kinds of things as Liz says.

396
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,680
 I want to take this open a little bit more broadly because you did touch on the fact that some

397
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,600
 conventions choose their guests because this person is a stalwart of the community and we want to

398
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,480
 one of them and some people or they write very very good books and we would like to bring them

399
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,440
 to a wider to wider notice and some people choose their guests on the basis of who will put the most

400
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:25,840
 bums on seats and I don't know are these equally valid approaches? Wilcon has an internal I don't

401
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,520
 know if it's formally a rule but they have an internal notion that people will have spent 25

402
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,040
 years in the field before they get invited as a Wilcon guest and that means that we often get

403
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,680
 complaints that all the Wilcon guests are very old as a result of that and that's why you get

404
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,080
 and that's why you get people like Charlie Jane and Charlie Jane Anderson and Lee Newitz being invited

405
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,640
 to be Toastmasters right because you don't need to have done a certain amount of work to be Toastmaster

406
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,200
 but it does let you celebrate let's you celebrate kind of younger members of the community because

407
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,120
 the Toastmasters not a Wilcon guest and actually that's a really good point because it does

408
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,400
 I guess it does mean that especially with Wilcons you do end up with a with a pool that is more likely

409
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,240
 to have perhaps said things in the past then or proud of and wanted to to change although I can't

410
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,600
 remember many yeah but there's different there's different ways there's a very standard way of

411
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,160
 dealing with this which is somebody says oh in at such and such a time you were saying such and such

412
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:32,480
 a thing and you go you're right I should never have done that I am terribly sorry I have given a

413
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,840
 proportion of my income to the teddy bears protection league or whatever because of the terrible things

414
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,480
 I've said in the past and and everyone goes oh right then mostly I obviously don't people can't do

415
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,880
 that which is important if you're thinking of honoring dead people and there are some things

416
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,920
 for which that's not considered be adequate but that's not mostly the case for the people in our

417
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,040
 community no and I think I think like obviously most world cons the only world cons that have

418
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,800
 honored dead people I think are people who died after they were announced with I think there's one

419
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,200
 exception right but I can't remember what the one exception is there's a ghost of honor for one

420
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,360
 world con right yeah I can't remember who it was there have occasionally been guests of honor at

421
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,680
 world cons and Easter cons it's a great pun and then it is normal for world cons to um continue to

422
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,480
 want a guest who died in the who weren't tended to be guests and have now died um I think I'm back

423
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,680
 to um you do need to do your work though so I also because I'd slightly prefer to see guests who

424
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,760
 may not be 100% perfect people but are towering figures in the community and again that there's a

425
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,920
 borderline there because there are things I don't want to you know I don't think we should be inviting

426
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:53,360
 Islamophobic American comic artists you know that sort of thing um but or because one of the

427
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,560
 alternatives to that is to invite people who nobody has ever heard of and and it is certainly

428
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,520
 true that if you do that the chances that people will have things to say about them is much reduced

429
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,400
 but it makes your convention a bit less exciting I mean obviously there is a middle ground in between

430
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:15,600
 inviting racists and people no one's met there is but I mean so uh to take for example some years

431
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,240
 ago now a primarily on live journal which tells you all it was there was the whole um race fail

432
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:27,680
 thing right yeah and a lot of names in science fiction and fantasy were involved in it and many

433
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,320
 of them are subsequently invited to conventions as guests as I know and I'm sure some of them have

434
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,120
 discussed it and discussed their feelings better at the time I mean I think certainly like my

435
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,640
 you know I think I'm certainly like my opinions and thoughts on things have definitely changed

436
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,400
 like in the that 15 year span or whatever and I'm sure a lot of theirs have as well but in some cases

437
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:54,320
 we now have like these discussions that were taking place online and can be you know we're there

438
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,280
 for everyone to see and I think the key thing to get to think about is like if you're inviting

439
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:05,360
 this person as a guest and there is something in their history where you feel like this could

440
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,720
 be a problem for many attendees and the thing to do is to look at it and see you know what kind of

441
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,600
 magnitude was it and what is their response now to you bringing it up to them is their response to

442
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:22,240
 say yes that was you know a mistake I made in the past and I have done this to you know make up for

443
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,880
 it or is it them to say you know that's the thing I did in the past it's all ancient history or is

444
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,440
 the thing say yes it's something I did in the past and I would stand by those opinions now and I'm

445
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,560
 thinking again of wisc on who is the wisc on guest of honor so this is the like the first one I can

446
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,360
 think of where someone was disinvited as a guest of honor Elizabeth Moon that was it

447
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:54,000
 I remember this and this was way back in 2010-2011 she was disinvited essentially for saying things

448
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,720
 on her blog that were not acceptable to membership so you know this is not entirely a new thing that

449
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,840
 is happening but obviously I would guess at the time that this happened because they were online

450
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,880
 and it could spread around whereas previously that might have been in a fanzine with limited

451
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,920
 circulation I think race fell is interesting because it did two there was two things going on

452
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,960
 there so first of all plenty of people who really shouldn't have been were were on the the wrong

453
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:31,760
 side of that argument but also some of the the argument was not just being advanced by people

454
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,640
 of good intentions and character it was also being stirred by an agitator so not an agitator because

455
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,800
 somebody who who was um oh I want I think science fiction fandom really needs to address this which

456
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:52,800
 it did and has done now I think a lot um but also somebody who was like I can increase my personal

457
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,400
 store by making this a bigger argument than it would otherwise be so and that that turned out to

458
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,160
 involve a lot of quite bad behavior so it's complicated when you're when you're making arguments you might

459
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,200
 not also want to make death threats that sort of thing that's true Alice and I originally

460
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,600
 disagreed on disinviting Tony vice-cough but then when she doubled down and said to the

461
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,920
 main forums were fine and didn't need any um work that was the point of which we both very much

462
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,440
 were in agreement of oh no like she could start off and if she had launched a widespread program

463
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,280
 of reform I would have been like maybe they should re-invite her because she's clearly

464
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,560
 because there needs to be an incentive for people coming around to a perspective that the community

465
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,120
 finds more compelling I think and maybe that doesn't need to take the form of honoring them but like

466
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,120
 I don't know like if you are showing that you're like in the case of race fail if you said things

467
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,240
 that you then reflected on and are no longer representative of your opinions I don't think

468
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,200
 that should disqualify you from being a guest of honor necessarily if if you've done that work

469
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,360
 but if you if you're Elizabeth Moon and you've stood by the things you wrote that got you disinvited

470
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,080
 from Wizcon I'd be surprised if a world con then invited Elizabeth Moon as a guest of honor

471
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,600
 because I don't think she has done that work and that Wizcon disinvited invitation was a decade

472
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:17,520
 ago now which is terrifying yeah so this has all been going on for quite a long time yeah I I must

473
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,120
 admit and I'm really glad Liz brought that up because I had forgotten that that had happened

474
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,200
 but but that is actually a really good point that this I was I was very much thinking of this as a

475
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,560
 kind of recent discussion but it but it isn't as much as I thought it was I think it's gotten louder

476
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,320
 but I don't think it's new in some ways I think it's got less loud I think science fiction fandom

477
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,480
 reflected after all of that and to a very large extent put its stall in order

478
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:49,280
 and one of the things that we're not bad at is taking the being a global community seriously and

479
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,240
 and making the sorts of changes to our behavior that you need to do if you are a global community

480
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:01,040
 we are not perfect collection of individuals individuals never perfect but I think you do see

481
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,840
 over and over again in SF that we have these sorts of arguments and then we go oh well does that

482
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,560
 mean we have to change and change itself people it takes longer than it should we're not as good

483
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,800
 as it might be I don't think race fail which I wasn't really involved with but was reading at the time

484
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,080
 is a thing I can really put into context but I can link a couple posts in the show notes which do

485
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,280
 I want from NK Jemisin in 2010 talking about it and you know what good things might have come

486
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:37,040
 out of it and there's one from Jamie Go last year in Strange Horizons thinking about definitions

487
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,960
 of whiteness and Eurocentrism and how they end up post-race fail so I will put those in the show

488
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,600
 notes when he wants to go and read up on it more I want to those links to a primer on it on fan

489
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,840
 law in case you missed this discussion entirely which you may have because it was in 2009

490
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,880
 on the topic of race fail and I'll sort of go of ethnicity and privilege I think the other

491
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,480
 thing that's worth knowing is that we are obviously all coming at this from a kind of

492
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:11,840
 European white perspective and I don't know the extent to which like if you're a person of color

493
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:18,160
 in the States I don't know how you viewed Tony Vice-Cough's invitation kind of before the

494
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,040
 controversy in January you thought it was terrible and you thought it told you something about

495
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,680
 disc golf and what sort of convention it was I mean not all of them but many of them because

496
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,320
 people are not coherent block and I suspect that many of our listeners are in fact in the same

497
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:42,400
 boat as we are so so I obviously like our perspectives are limited and we we I think are all mindful

498
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,560
 of our privilege but if you are if you have any thoughts on this from that perspective please do

499
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,560
 write in because I'd be interested to hear them I think this links is background which is if you

500
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,880
 are a convention and you are thinking of inviting someone as a guest of honor and you are trying

501
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,600
 to do your due diligence and talk to people then you have to talk to people who have a different

502
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:09,520
 perspective than you do and yeah you also have to think about what it means if you do decide to

503
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,920
 invite that person because I suspect yeah what it meant was a lot of fans looked at this con and

504
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,640
 maybe said this is not the convention for me and they have alternatives they can go to other

505
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,800
 conventions they can go to firecon where they know they're going to feel much more comfortable

506
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,200
 and I think you have to think about what this says about the ethos and the nature of your convention

507
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,800
 and the people you want to attract and what sort of convention you want to be and your

508
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,240
 guess of honor are like the one of the public expressions of the convention you would like to be

509
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,480
 which doesn't mean you can just invite diverse guess of honor and have done with it but you do

510
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,920
 need to think about who you invite as guess of honor as part of it I will also say that although I

511
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,840
 absolutely accept I am dripping in with white privilege Liz and I are both women and all sorts

512
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:02,800
 of things are continuing to demonstrate that people have not learned the you know I'm still

513
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,600
 watching new movies I am reading new books where the notion that women are people and

514
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,760
 should not therefore example be given as prizes to the hero the notion that women deserve to have

515
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,240
 equal roles in in science fiction is still kind of out there and um frankmiller is not just a

516
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:31,280
 lamaphobic you know um so so so it's not just about race um I would like you know you want people

517
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:39,600
 who demonstrate that they take well essentially the the humanity of women as as a critical part of

518
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:45,760
 what they're doing as well please and I think this is all just about thinking about your guests and

519
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,280
 why you're inviting them and what what the honor believes and should you do it when you bid

520
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,280
 convention committees bemoan the fact that you want people to bid on the basis of how competent

521
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,440
 the people are to run the convention and what you actually get is people bidding on how much they

522
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,480
 want to visit a Winnipeg rather than Shendue or whatever um and so all you do if you add guests

523
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,280
 into the bidding mix is that you give people another thing to vote on that isn't how competent

524
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,760
 the committee is so I want to say two things which is firstly and this is something that's been

525
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,720
 happening in the I listened to an actual play podcast and they had someone right to them basically

526
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,160
 saying like actually you've got this thing in your kind of basic and seat which is super problematic

527
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,880
 in terms of like ethnicity and they hired a cultural consultant to come on and kind of um

528
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,120
 talk it through with them and they made changes based on that and I think that's the thing it is

529
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,280
 not about not making mistakes but it's about when you notice you've made the mistake taking the

530
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,840
 actions you need to take as a result and I do wonder whether conventions like I wonder whether

531
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,760
 cultural consultants might be the sort of people that might be able to help out with that but I don't

532
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,160
 know um to what extent that's true on the topic of the difference between ethnicity and gender I do

533
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,720
 notice that all three of the examples we've currently got in the show notes are examples where someone

534
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,640
 was found out to have problematic views in terms of um white privilege or ethnicity and were then

535
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,400
 disadvantaged and as far as I can tell we haven't mentioned any examples where people have been

536
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,760
 disinvited for things connected to sexism or things connected to me too or things like that

537
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,280
 so I wonder whether that will be when I was saying this is a newer discussion I wonder whether the

538
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,600
 thing that's newer is in fact the more gender component to the conversation because I do think

539
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,800
 gender has been something we've we've kind of come on a little bit on in the last few years with

540
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,320
 discussions like me too. I am going to just mention that there was a lot of

541
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:50,880
 disquiet about the Saudi Arabian bid for WILCON and it's complicated because the a lot of the

542
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,520
 disquiet was focused about around LGBT rights um and I'm kind of like and that is all very well

543
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,880
 but they have half the population enslaved and you're not doing anything about it so you know

544
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,600
 again I feel like I feel like the gender issues are often not um not quite as um

545
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,840
 probably because they ought to be um but you know we have common cause there but so the Saudi

546
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:22,000
 Arabian bid despite the fact that the the fans who are bidding are absolutely lovely had people

547
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,800
 expressing a great deal of concern and I think also there's a great deal of concern around um

548
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:33,280
 the Chengdu bid because of the Chinese government's um record on human rights um

549
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,040
 so I just want to say one more thing which is in googling for ghosts of honor and I didn't find

550
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,240
 anything on ghosts of honor so if either of you do have good links please pop them oh I found it yeah

551
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:53,600
 oh good good but pork or nail back in 2011 suggested a um suggested the concept of the um

552
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,880
 ghost of honor future so as well as the ghost of honor past and the guest of honor present you

553
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,080
 have the ghost of honor future uh and it was you have an unknown individual listed as a guest of

554
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,000
 honor and then you have a vote at like the world con 50 years out to retrospectively decide like

555
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,200
 who was born that year who would have been who has made the biggest contribution to the genre

556
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,680
 and I like I think obviously because the point of the guest of honor is to impact the programming

557
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,240
 so I'm not really sure whether it works as like a logistical con running concept but it is kind of

558
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,400
 cool I do quite like the idea of of of trying to have like the person for each world con who was

559
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,920
 born that year who had the greatest effect on the community thereafter um so I've put a link to his

560
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,560
 blog post in the show notes because I made me smile. Beckon H7D Succon had hg wells as the ghost of

561
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:54,960
 honor and they had um Ian Watson dressing up as hg wells and we had a plan and giving a very good

562
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,200
 very well received ghost of honor speech in the body of hg wells and I'm sure hg wells was problematic

563
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:09,280
 but you know it's quite a long time ago for both hg and um hg wells and of course um the plot.com

564
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:17,520
 in 2000 had was expecting to have a lot of fetuses at it because um because Caroline and I were both

565
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,200
 very pregnant at the time of the convention and as was Laurie Meltzer but in fact Laurie couldn't

566
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,320
 come to the convention because her baby decided to come seven weeks early so there we go.

567
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,680
 Shall we do pics? Yeah yeah let's do quick pics quickly. Quick little pickles. Quick pics.

568
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,920
 Alright I went see shong chi and the legend of the 10 rings I enjoyed it a lot. In the cinema did

569
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,040
 you go to the cinema? I went see it in the cinema on a Tuesday at 1045 there were two other people

570
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,840
 which honestly was busier than I was expecting. That's what I'm planning to do for dune? That's

571
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:06,720
 fair um the I quite liked it. It cheats for sort of two key reasons which is firstly it's got

572
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,920
 aquafina in it and I love aquafina so I was always always going to be partial to this particular

573
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,160
 movie and she is very good in it and secondly it's set in san francisco and I do love san francisco.

574
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:22,240
 Unsurprisingly listeners I enjoyed it. Yeah no I'd accidentally got the impression it was set in

575
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,040
 china so there you go but I learned that this is about the chinese american experience and chinese

576
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,520
 americans often love this movie. So the beginning of the film is set in san francisco and then by the

577
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:39,600
 end they are in china. It is it is very good. I enjoyed it a lot and I was glad I went see it.

578
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,880
 I think it might be in my top five marvel movies because I really did very much enjoy it but as I

579
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,040
 said it is it is very much my cup of tea and it reminded me weirdly of always be my maybe which I

580
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:57,520
 also love and it's also set in san francisco and it's got aliwong and rundal park in and they're

581
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,600
 very good and I would recommend that film as well. So you know cheeky extra pick.

582
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:08,320
 It is it has lots of chinese culture in it lots of the dialogue is in mandarin and people from

583
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:14,400
 around asia have commented on how it's got it's a superhero with a chinese backstory that is

584
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,400
 not racist. This is good. I mean I might say there's quite a low bat there's quite a low bar to

585
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,720
 what are you what are you quoting there though? I'm the new york times.

586
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,800
 Alison do you want to do pics?

587
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,560
 Yeah I it has been a week since we last recorded and I believe that I have done

588
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:39,680
 no genre reading or watching in that week apart from a bit more foundation.

589
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:46,320
 I have instead watched more of the new season of tus master very funny.

590
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,360
 I have read a book called the how not to die diet which is kind of related in that it was given to

591
00:48:53,360 --> 00:49:00,160
 me by the science fiction fan who runs publishing company but other than that it doesn't really

592
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:08,480
 have anything to do with science fiction. Spoiler immediately adopt a plant based whole foods based

593
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:16,080
 diet that is very low in processed foods. Bit depressing really and and I started to read a large

594
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,920
 book about the fact song of england. I thought you were doing quick pics Alison.

595
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,720
 I've said I waffled for five minutes and that isn't even five minutes.

596
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,880
 Yeah I don't think we need five minutes on.

597
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,160
 On things such a lot genre.

598
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,840
 So no genre for me this week.

599
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,320
 I also I mean I did consume some genre things this week but I didn't like

600
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,640
 the very much and I don't really mean about them on the podcast so I'll go with the genre thing

601
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,000
 which I finished consuming last week. I mean I'm going to call it genre. I basically finished playing

602
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,560
 the fourth uncharted game. They are basically what if you were playing a video game but it was sort

603
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:56,880
 of Indiana Jones but with more pirates and stuff. So basically they're fun action ventures and they

604
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,640
 also get much better as the series goes on because in the first one the protagonist is really

605
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,800
 just a dick and by the fourth one he's become a likable dick.

606
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,360
 You know the fourth one is the sort of I've given up the treasure hunting business and I've gone

607
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,880
 legit but my brother comes to visit me and he pulls me back in for one last vital mission etc.

608
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,040
 But by the last one they've just become incredibly slick experiences and it is kind of as close as

609
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,120
 you can get to actually playing a movie and I'm pressing the buttons at the right time to leap

610
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:35,600
 off the ledge and so on. Alison's making a face at me because Alison's saying these are sort of

611
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:41,280
 games she'd hate but they're lots of fun. I mean I'm good I don't know if I mentioned Baba as you

612
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,840
 last um Octa thought but I am playing Baba as you. I am completely stuck in multiple different places

613
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:57,040
 so I like the sense of a game that makes you think a lot and where you get stuck and

614
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,560
 preferably without any cutscenes or if there have to be cutscenes can they make them short please.

615
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:07,440
 There are a lot of cutscenes in this but I mean this is an orchy dog game and they are

616
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,720
 basically spectacularly better at cutscenes than most people because I think they literally

617
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:18,880
 have the actors do them and you know motion kept the face to make it look like it is actually a

618
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,080
 person rather than sort of an assembly of polygons in some way but their actors look

619
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,560
 incredibly good and so when you're watching the cutscenes it is like you are watching a scene

620
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,280
 from a movie and I think they can do that by only having like five characters and they spend

621
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,640
 lots of time lovingly getting the mocap working for those five characters basically.

622
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:45,280
 I put some YouTube vids in. It's just a movie isn't it it's a movie. Yeah but it's a fun movie where I

623
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,240
 get it's a movie with buttons yeah it's basically a movie with buttons where I get to climb up the

624
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,240
 cliff and stuff. Why isn't it a movie where you can play Crash Bandicoot in the middle? Oh you do

625
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,240
 have to play Crash Bandicoot and that's really annoying but it's over as soon as you die so.

626
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,120
 And it is genre because any universe in which someone can kill that many people and still be

627
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:12,400
 charismatic must not be set in our universe. I mean the other counterpoint to that is James Bond

628
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:19,520
 whose body count in the latest James Bond film is astonishing. That was the 43rd episode of the

629
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,160
 OctaThought Podcast. Thank you very much again to Stow shirts for sponsoring this episode of

630
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,440
 the podcast and it's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.

631
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:39,680
 OctaThought, OctaThought. You can listen to us and talk and to John and list two. OctaThought

632
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:48,560
 is here for you. We discuss, we review on everything we have of you. Talking cons and talking fans if

633
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:54,640
 it's Fandor, OctaCork and... Look how here comes an OctaThought. We will not be doing

634
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,560
 OctaThought live at Corflu but that's because we're doing OctaThought live at Novocon. I mean

635
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:07,120
 effectively you will be doing OctaThought live at Corflu it's just it will be at 1am and it will

636
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,000
 be in the bar and it will just be John and it's talking loudly. I've got a microphone on my phone.

637
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,680
 We could record a little bit of OctaThought. We could record a little segment for OctaThought

638
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,280
 live from the bar at Corflu. We can ring Liz. We can ring Liz a record and all to

639
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,400
 thought which is just us leaving messages on Liz's voicemail. No no no what time what time

640
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,680
 are we staying up to? What time will it be in Bangkok? If you stay up late enough I will have got up.

641
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:42,080
 It'll be six hours ahead. No I will be seven hours ahead because the clocks have changed.

642
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:48,880
 Yes so it'll be seven hours ahead. Yes brilliant. So we could do that thing where we are drunk

643
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,800
 in the middle of the night and Liz is having breakfast and she's like oh we're like high Liz.

644
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,000
 Yeah pretty much. It's Alice and Johnny the bar.

645
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,560
 Drunk but it's just the morning and I am sober but I haven't on the max. If you could have

646
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:08,080
 raged to have an on the max at that point that would be really awesome. Okay let's let's not get

647
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,040
 too ambitious because I am going to have to get up early for this. I'm not sure I'm going to get

648
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,320
 up early enough to go out and buy an onalmon max but I will try. How early is it? Well how late are

649
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:25,840
 you going to stay up? I don't know. At least 2 am. I don't know John is a lightweight so these days.

650
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,120
 Well I stay up later at conventions as I do on zoom. We'll see and you'll have a couple of goals

651
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:37,760
 at it I guess. Let me see when the quest on shop opens. I think we should probably aim for Friday

652
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,960
 night. We are going to be there Thursday night. I might be very drunk by Friday night though.

653
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,480
 We I don't think are going to be there on Thursday night and also on Friday Liz will have work

654
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,840
 and doing it on a day that Liz has work seems a bit unusual. Yeah we can't do it Thursday night so

655
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,840
 Friday night Saturday morning. I'm just glad that all of this is going in the podcast so that

656
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,960
 people can hold us to it. Well the quest on shop where they serve the onalmon maxis which

657
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,960
 I will not we have not explained on the podcast yet so maybe that could be the pick for whenever you

658
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:12,720
 phone me up drunkenly. They open 830 so I might have to go and get one the day before just to be ready.

659
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,440
 Okay. You might have to stick it in your oven. That's okay. Almond questions don't really like

660
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,840
 being kept overnight. What do you mean? What do you mean? That'd be fine but I think I will need

661
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:28,160
 Almond Quest on a coffee to cope with you guys. The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for
