00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 Thank you to everyone at Ch icon who came up and said kind words about the podcast, especially

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,280
 the ones who I had never met before and especially the person on the day before the convention

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,760
 started who overheard me and Liz and Ispania talking on the way back from breakfast and

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,520
 said, "Oh, you're from OctaThorp, I recognise your voice."

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
 That was very good.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,880
 That has never happened to me before.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,520
 Hello, person who listens to OctaThorp, it would lovely to meet you.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,920
 I hope you had a lovely Ch icon right in and tell us all about it, please.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hello, everyone and welcome to the very 67th episode of OctaThorp, a podcast for Science

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,560
 Fiction and Science Fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 29th of September 2022.

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
 I'm John Coxon.

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
 I'm Alison Scott.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,920
 And I'm Liz Batty.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,440
 And this is the first time we have been sitting in our places with our microphones in a few

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
 weeks.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,160
 So, hello Alison and Liz.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,720
 Last time I saw you, Liz was perimidilbus and the time before that I was a computer.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,040
 So how are you both doing?

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,400
 Well, we did spend a week eating in enormous breakfast together and generally hanging out.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
 That's true.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
 Was that you guys?

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
 Interesting.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,120
 Yeah, the last time I saw John, I was sneaking out of our hotel room trying not to wake him

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,800
 up at 5 in the morning.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
 I don't remember seeing you.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,840
 So I imagine it worked well.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
 So I succeeded.

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
 Hooray, okay.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
 Yes.

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,120
 I'm sure that didn't read to come out quite the way it did.

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,640
 Who knows.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,960
 It came out exactly how it was intended.

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,560
 I was sneaking out of John's hotel room early in the morning.

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,600
 But yes, we have some letters of comments and we have a variety of letters of comment

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,320
 on quite old episodes of OctaThorp.

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,880
 So we travel back in time to the 20th of August where a man called Christopher J. Garcia sent

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,640
 us a lock about OctaThorp, episode 64, and said that the transition from 32-bit OctaThorp

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,040
 to OctaThorp 64 will lead to confusion, but ultimately you'll adjust.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,360
 So I'm glad the listenership that Chris has confidence in you and let us know how that

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,920
 transition has been going.

41
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,240
 He also proposes an alternative to the Broily Competence theory and his alternative is the

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,640
 Garcia rule of voting thing.

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,920
 It doesn't matter why you vote for a thing.

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,880
 It's concise.

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,120
 It doesn't have a lot of provisos.

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,960
 There's relatively few subsections.

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,360
 Yeah, it's a very Garcia approach.

48
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,080
 It is although he does then go on to tell us a little bit about some of his Hugo votes

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,800
 and why he's voting for them.

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,840
 So he is undermining his own voting rule.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,000
 And he does note there are exceptions and notes the dirt bag incursion of 2014-2016,

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 which is fair.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,880
 It's good exception.

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:55,000
 We also got some comments on the fact that Alison referred to Star Wars Lower Decks.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,080
 I was going to make that the episode title, but relented in the face of Alison looking

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,400
 sad when I said I was going to do that.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
 But I did leave it in.

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,240
 And so everyone wrote in to say that Alison had done that.

59
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
 And yes, it was very funny.

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,400
 We didn't notice at the time we didn't correct her.

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
 We're bad people.

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
 Sorry, Alison.

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,840
 I didn't want to have Star Wars Lower Decks as the episode title because I had done us

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,520
 as Star Wars characters the previous episode.

65
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,760
 And I've just realized, oh shit, I could have just done a commemorative plate with the picture

66
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,200
 from the previous episode as the middle of the plate.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,680
 And that would have saved me about $10,000 at Oh God.

68
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,520
 And then the nature of time saving hacks, I do expect every piece of episode artwork from

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,160
 now on to be a commemorative plate of some kind or other.

70
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,560
 Yeah, because I could do a commemorative plate really quickly now because the way I did the

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:53,240
 commemorative plate cover was to generate a commemorative plate making macro for Photoshop.

72
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:59,360
 So we got some letters of comment on episode 65 action castle two.

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,080
 But unfortunately, I didn't understand any of them because you all used the wrong verbs.

74
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:11,440
 It's fair to say that some of our listeners did not particularly like the action castle

75
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,640
 episode and at least once said that it gave them info com flashbacks.

76
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,800
 So sorry about that if that's you.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,760
 Remember to keep the junk mail.

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,920
 You'll need it later.

79
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,320
 We got some comments on episode 66 on Facebook.

80
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,760
 I haven't had any emails yet, but I'm sure we will.

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,880
 But we got Facebook comments and a lot of people liked the picture of the three of us at the

82
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,800
 Hugo's listener Liz Batty said that my hair was very annoying.

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,200
 Sorry about that, Liz.

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,840
 And Laurie Anderson from Hugo Girl posted to say, how did we fail to record even one

85
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,480
 second of friendship audio?

86
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,720
 And that is that is a good point.

87
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,200
 We did not record any Hugo Girl friendship audio.

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 It's very sad, but there are some photos of us and Hugo Girl people hanging out, which

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,280
 was very good.

90
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,760
 But there will be in the future maybe at some point when we come to Dragoncon next year,

91
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
 we're all going to Dragoncon.

92
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,760
 You heard it here first, including Alison and Liz who didn't know.

93
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,200
 Liz continues to knit and Alison is a gape.

94
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,640
 I'm more likely to go to Dragoncon than Chengdu next year, but I'm probably more likely to

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,200
 go to Winnipeg than either.

96
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
 Where is Winnipeg?

97
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,080
 Can you like Winnipeg and Dragoncon on consecutive weekends and die?

98
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,640
 Permacon is the 20th to the 5th of July and Dragoncon is Labor Day weekend, so you couldn't.

99
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,040
 So that's not happening then.

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,800
 I'm not going to any of these conventions.

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
 It would be lovely, but it's not going to happen.

102
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,840
 I'm going to Australia and New Zealand.

103
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
 Oh.

104
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,280
 For my guff trip.

105
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,080
 Now I have looked it up.

106
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,040
 What I could do is go to Winnipeg and then the weekend after go to Gencon.

107
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
 Interesting.

108
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,280
 Oh, that sounds like an amazing thing to do.

109
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
 I thought you had no more money ever.

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
 Well, I might have some more money by then, I might be able to save up.

111
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,880
 Yeah, we know you're going to spend it on them.

112
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,640
 Oh, Chicago was expensive.

113
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
 It was great.

114
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
 It was not cheap.

115
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,520
 Yeah, let's talk about Chicago.

116
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
 Chicago is great.

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,000
 It's very tall.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,880
 Alison, how did you find it?

119
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,040
 It was proportionately more taller than it was for me or Liz, for you.

120
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
 It's tall, but it's also quite kind of big.

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,600
 It's got a lot of space.

122
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:26,200
 It has a river and it also has a lake, but the lake is quite big, so it feels like a

123
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
 sea.

124
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,680
 I think the lake is as big as the Netherlands.

125
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,200
 So that's quite big.

126
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,040
 Can you put that in terms of double decker buses or whales?

127
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,520
 I think you could fit a lot of...

128
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,960
 Oh, no, the lake is probably bigger than whales because it's about as big as the Netherlands.

129
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
 It's big.

130
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
 It's really big.

131
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,080
 You may think it's a long way, just going out into shops, but that's just peanuts compared

132
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,240
 to Lake Michigan.

133
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
 Indeed.

134
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,520
 Chicago is pretty big and pretty tall.

135
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,840
 It's got a lot of skyscrapers.

136
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,480
 Some of them are very interesting.

137
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,400
 And I discovered that I love the work of Bertrand Goldberg, and wish there were more of it, in

138
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
 Chicago.

139
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,360
 He has two skyscrapers, one pair and one extra on the tour, and they're the best things

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,040
 on the entire tour.

141
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,760
 You may have to explain what tour...

142
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,800
 Yes, what tour are you referring to here, Alison?

143
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,200
 Yeah, we went on an architectural boat trip of Chicago, where our person giving us the

144
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,280
 guide was a real tour.

145
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:31,960
 So she kept explaining whether the building was rental or office or condominiums or whatever,

146
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,840
 and also she talked to an enormous amount about corner offices.

147
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,520
 So that was a bit weird, but otherwise it was very interesting to her.

148
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,200
 So to explain the tour in a more general level, rather than a very specific grope with the

149
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,720
 tour before he played what the tour was, it was a boat tour, and we went up and down the

150
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,160
 river in Chicago, and a very nice lady pointed out buildings and told us about the buildings,

151
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
 and it was good.

152
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,960
 And she explained who had done the buildings, and then also got quite into the weeds in some

153
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
 aspects.

154
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,480
 But it was very interesting, and I was glad to have done it at the start, because it meant

155
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,320
 when I was later walking around Chicago, and I saw these buildings from the bottom of the

156
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,240
 buildings, I was like, "Whoa, that's a tall building!"

157
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,680
 And there was also other art in Chicago.

158
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,840
 There was the Art Institute, I saw Night Hawks, which was amazing, and I also did not see the

159
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,160
 Tiffany Dome, but that was fine, because I'd been to the Tiffany Museum.

160
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,200
 Weirdly, the Tiffany Museum is in Winter Park near Orlando in Florida, given that a lot of

161
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,720
 Tiffany's work was Chicago-based.

162
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,280
 There is surprisingly little of it in Chicago, and if you want to see it, you need to go to

163
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,960
 Florida for some reason.

164
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,040
 I also had, I did not, I had a fine hot dog, I didn't have a great hot dog, I had a fine

165
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
 hot dog.

166
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,560
 I had a couple of pretty good hot dogs, I don't know whether I had kind of the canonical

167
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,280
 Chicago hot dog.

168
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,960
 Liz, what were your cultural highlights of Chicago?

169
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,720
 Well, I don't eat hot dogs, but I did have a couple of deep pumpitas, that was pretty

170
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 good.

171
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,240
 Yeah, I just loved Chicago as a city, the weather when we were there, just before the

172
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,840
 con was perfect in that it was sunny and bright and warm, but not too hot.

173
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:15,520
 So I got one of the Chicago municipal e-bikes and biked it along the lake shore, up to

174
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,560
 the zoo, which is very nice, and e-bikes really sort out any pesky hills on the way.

175
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
 Not really hills, but inclines.

176
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,320
 Yeah, it's just a really lovely place to go and hang around, it has nice parks, it has

177
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,800
 these really impressive skyscrapers, you know, a bit about the skyscrapers, because

178
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,280
 ladies told you about how much of the architecture appears to depend on either having too many

179
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,320
 corner offices or not having enough corner offices, it seems to be a very big influence

180
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,760
 on how the architecture was done.

181
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,240
 Yeah, I mean I have no idea what it's like to actually live in Chicago, because I only

182
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,240
 really sort of went around the central bits, but it is a really nice place to spend a week

183
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,360
 full of exciting cultural opportunities and good food.

184
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,880
 I hung out quite a bit with Nigel Rowe, who lives quite close to the centre of Chicago,

185
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,600
 and he was extremely enthusiastic about living in Chicago, he thinks it's a fantastic place

186
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,240
 to live, which is why he lives there, given that he's from New Zealand.

187
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,800
 We also went down to the museum quarter and we went to the older Planetarium, which is

188
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,920
 the oldest planetarium in North America.

189
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,400
 In common with most planetarium has had its planetarium mechanism removed, because they're

190
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,880
 completely obsolete.

191
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,400
 We also looked at a lot of gardens, we went to the beach, we did not go swimming because

192
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,360
 there were massive signs saying no swimming everywhere, which I now understand are just

193
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,000
 kind of performative signs, and you're actually fine to swim, you just, they really should

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,640
 say do not swim and then try to sue the city about it.

195
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,360
 As Liz said, the weather in Chicago is often very difficult, both in summer and in winter,

196
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,960
 but when we were there it was extremely lovely the whole time pretty well, except when we

197
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,840
 were breakfast.

198
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,160
 We did get very soaked one day and I was wearing my Glasgow t-shirt ready for the 10 o'clock

199
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,600
 site selection announcement that Glasgow had won the Worldcon, and by the time I returned

200
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,320
 to the hotel I woke up about five minutes from the restaurant, I could no longer wear

201
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 that t-shirt for two days while it dried out.

202
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,080
 But one of the other big advantages of Chicago was that there was a Worldcon there.

203
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,280
 Was pretty good.

204
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,440
 Yeah, went to a Worldcon.

205
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,400
 So this is, Alison, this is your first American Worldcon since.

206
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,920
 It is my first US Worldcon since 1993, though we did go to anticipation in 2009.

207
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,360
 Liz, this was your first American convention since Tracon 7?

208
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
 Nope, I went to Mid-American in 2016.

209
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,880
 Oh, of course you did, you went with Anna.

210
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
 Yes.

211
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,680
 Taffter, look at Anna Raftry also went to Mid-American, and this was my first American

212
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,160
 Worldcon since San Jose in 2018.

213
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,160
 Conferencesco was the first convention that Ispani went to when she was new, and that

214
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,920
 was the 1993 Worldcon.

215
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,120
 It's the only time the Worldcon will ever be in downtown San Francisco, and so I really

216
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,440
 regret I wasn't old enough to go, but yes, it sounds like it would have been an amazing

217
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
 convention.

218
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,960
 I don't think I quite understood properly how to do Worldcons in 1993 when I was younger

219
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,600
 than any of the OctaThought team are now.

220
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,640
 But I mean, I was filming a lot in those days.

221
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,960
 Disgusting.

222
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,080
 If you were a filker, then your experience of Worldcon is very different from, if you

223
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,400
 are, a drinker.

224
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,560
 Alison was running the Fanzine Lounge, Liz was doing pro gops, and Ori wasn't doing anything.

225
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,440
 Often, Liz was doing spreadsheets, I think.

226
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,000
 There was some spread-cheating, but basically, because I had done program work, and they

227
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,400
 run up to the con, I already had a login for the program database and the ability to work

228
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,160
 the program database.

229
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,200
 So there was some people email you say, "Oh, I can't do this panel.

230
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
 You make changes.

231
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 You edit things.

232
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,760
 You make sure it ends up in the online schedule."

233
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,040
 And since there was not really a printed schedule, everyone was using the online one,

234
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,440
 which could be updated a couple of times a day.

235
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
 That was good.

236
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,400
 Yeah, fundamentally, it was one of those job where you basically sit and type in a window

237
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,720
 in this room for a couple of hours.

238
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,840
 So, it's not like an actual job.

239
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,280
 We probably should say, if you were going to criticize, well, things that I liked a lot

240
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,720
 about Chicon, several of my friends have been calling it Chicon, which has started to

241
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
 worry me.

242
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,400
 It's definitely Chicon, right?

243
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,280
 I had the target with Steven Silver in Reno in 2011, and successfully wound him right up.

244
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,840
 What you called it Chicon?

245
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
 Why is Chicago?

246
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
 So it must be Chicon.

247
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,160
 All right, fair enough.

248
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,360
 The Hyatt Regency is a single massive hotel in two parts, but it means that the entire

249
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,600
 convention is all on one site, and it is in, it is banging in the centre of town.

250
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,280
 It's more in the bit of Chicago you want to be in if you're on holiday.

251
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,520
 So it's very compact as these things go.

252
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,520
 It's exactly the right size for a Worldcon, and I think that's a big benefit of the convention.

253
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,880
 Unfortunately, it doesn't have terribly good Wi-Fi or internet access.

254
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,200
 Those of us who were roaming from America were in a good state because if you're on

255
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,080
 roaming, then your phone automatically grabs the best signal as a result of which we did

256
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,800
 mostly get signal throughout.

257
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,680
 But lots of people who've been told you could only use the online program, then didn't

258
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,760
 have any internet access all weekend.

259
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,440
 So that was kind of a comedy moment.

260
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,920
 I mean, I could only roll them to certain networks because of the way my phone is set.

261
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,840
 I had no problems with either Wi-Fi or the 3G.

262
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,720
 The Wi-Fi in the deals room and the exhibits hall was the conference Wi-Fi you had to pay

263
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,320
 for instead of the free Wi-Fi, which was vaguely annoying, but I had mobile signal down there

264
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,840
 so I wasn't really bothered because Ch icon went quite hard on not having a lot of paper

265
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,040
 around, which I really applaud.

266
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,520
 And I think they thought they were going to have free Wi-Fi down in the conference bit

267
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
 of the convention.

268
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
 Oh, they definitely did.

269
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,840
 And then the higher did not provide that.

270
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,120
 And I think that was a sticking point for anyone who is less technologically minded than

271
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
 the three of us.

272
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,560
 And I think I can see that being a problem.

273
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,840
 But equally like, hopefully it's something that next time, next time there is a convention

274
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,360
 in Chicago, which presumably will be 2032, the convention committee will be like, last

275
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,360
 time you did this and next time you absolutely cannot do this and hopefully it will get sort

276
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
 of shaken out then.

277
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,440
 It did feel like a very nickel and diming thing for this hotel, which must have made

278
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,800
 an absolute honest to goodness fortune that weekend.

279
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,640
 I mean, you'd say that, but I think the problem is that, you know, right now is an incredibly

280
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,560
 bad time for anyone from the UK to be paying the things in dollars because when I looked

281
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,520
 at the hotel rates, I thought, oh, the hotel rates are on the high side.

282
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,320
 I'll see if anywhere else in Chicago has a better hotel rate.

283
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,040
 And the answer was no, unless I wanted a bed in a six-dorm hostel room.

284
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,440
 Like, I'm sure they were making money, but compared to the cost of literally anywhere

285
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,920
 else in the city, it was a reasonably good deal.

286
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,160
 Yes, it was probably quite an expensive.

287
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,520
 The dollar is doing quite well at the moment, so the powders do quite badly at the moment,

288
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,200
 and everything felt quite expensive.

289
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,960
 Yeah, so a lot of it was a shock to basically be thinking, well, this is basically one-to-one.

290
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,720
 But I think the prices seem reasonable for what you get, which is a big fancy hotel in

291
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,000
 the middle of a made city, although it is sorely in need of renovating.

292
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,520
 And I think they compare favorably with things like the cost of hotel rooms near, say, the

293
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,920
 Dublin or Helsinki Wilcons.

294
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,040
 Oh, I mean, certainly I feel less poor than I did after Helsinki.

295
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,080
 Jesus, and Dublin, oh my goodness.

296
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,920
 Like, no, I mean, we're talking relatively, but European World Cons.

297
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,040
 And actually not, Lunkon so much.

298
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,840
 Lunkon had like quite a good range of relatively reasonable housing nearby, but Dublin, especially

299
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,480
 Yowza.

300
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
 And that wasn't Dublin 2019's fault, like I have friends who live in Dublin, and they're

301
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,720
 like, no, the housing situation here is just mad, and there's nothing you could do about

302
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
 it.

303
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,560
 But like, I looked at taking a fellowship in Dublin, and one of the things that maybe

304
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,720
 think maybe I'll stay in England was trying to look at like where I would live.

305
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,840
 And I was like, I don't know, I don't understand.

306
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,560
 But moving away from how expensive Chicago is.

307
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,520
 One of the things I really liked about Chicon is that I have met an enormous number of people

308
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:23,200
 online at conventions and a hybrid, virtual and hybrid conventions, and through the internet

309
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,840
 over the last two and a half years.

310
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,640
 And I met a lot of those people for the first time at Chicon in person, and that was incredibly

311
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
 nice.

312
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,080
 And I think it gave me some sense of what some of the feeling of the earlier science fiction

313
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
 conventions must have been like that.

314
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,440
 That some people were just getting a chance to meet somebody who they'd met and corresponded

315
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,720
 with for years, but had never actually got to beat.

316
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,920
 And Chicon really gave me a lot of that feeling.

317
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,400
 And I really, really enjoyed that.

318
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,960
 We were all on programme items.

319
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,280
 I was on a few programme items.

320
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,200
 I was on a couple of kind of more fanishly minded programme items about kind of running

321
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,840
 conventions and podcasts and stuff.

322
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,960
 But I was on a panel starring Paulina Barron and Eric Choi and Bill Higgins and Mary Robinet

323
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,920
 Coel as the moderator on living in space, which was really good.

324
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,680
 Mary Robinet's moderation style is amazing.

325
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,000
 I don't think I've ever been on a panel as well moderated as that panel.

326
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,880
 She did a very good job of explaining to us all how she was going to do it, and then

327
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,120
 it worked really well.

328
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,640
 And she does the thing where at the start of the panel she asks people for the questions

329
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,720
 they have, and then she guides the discussion of the panel to answer all the questions the

330
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,120
 audience came to have answered.

331
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,880
 And that probably works better if you're a Hugo Award winning novelist and your panels

332
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,080
 are busy to the point where you get enough questions that you can structure a panel off

333
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
 of them.

334
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,800
 But it was a very good way of doing it and it meant we covered a wide range of topics.

335
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,880
 And people asked questions and some of them I had professional expertise in, which was

336
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,360
 interesting and always makes me feel weird.

337
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,160
 And the other panelists were fascinating.

338
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,880
 Bill Higgins works at Fermilab and so does radiation shielding.

339
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,400
 But as he noted on the panel, I've probably got more of a relevant view of that because

340
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,080
 obviously at Fermilab their approach to radiation shielding is just put it underground, it'll

341
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
 be fine.

342
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,280
 And that is harder to do in space because there's no ground.

343
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,600
 I did point out on the moon, you can use the ground again so maybe the solution is definitely

344
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
 moon bases.

345
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,080
 But yes, it was really good.

346
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,560
 And I was on a different panel about Star Wars, I like Star Wars, but we'll come to that

347
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,920
 later listeners foreshadowing.

348
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,600
 I wasn't on any virtual panels, they were all in person.

349
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,840
 I don't know if any of them were streamed.

350
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,600
 The mirror when it was was because they were taking questions from the stream.

351
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,320
 So that must be on the internet somewhere for people to watch back.

352
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,160
 So then you can watch the panel items back now, but I don't know how long for.

353
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,360
 Yeah, you've got a month and I'm assuming that's a month from the end of the convention,

354
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,720
 but it might be a month from the beginning of the convention, in which case you have about

355
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,640
 two days after this episode drops to watch anything you missed from Shikon.

356
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,760
 What were you on, Alison and Liz?

357
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:11,040
 I was on two air meat panels and the first one I allowed myself about 45 minutes to get

358
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,720
 set up on air meat in my hotel room at the Hyatt.

359
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,960
 And it took me about 54 minutes to get set up.

360
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,120
 So I was late for my panel because air meat was quite difficult to configure in a hotel

361
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,160
 room in a different country.

362
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,840
 It turned out.

363
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
 And it was fine.

364
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:37,880
 I mean, I think there were some issues with, so air meat has some huge advantages, which

365
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
 is why they use it.

366
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,520
 It's a single, it's a kind of one key system.

367
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,720
 You basically let people in and then they're in and you gate them once and then it's sorted.

368
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,040
 And it has another huge advantage, which is that you, as soon as the panel's over, it's

369
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,840
 automatically the recordings there and you can go and look at it and all of that continues

370
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
 to work.

371
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:06,240
 I think that made up for quite a lot of disadvantages for this convention that was short of people

372
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,160
 points, particularly short of people on the virtual side because although people who cannot

373
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:19,440
 attend the convention quite like to attend virtually, we're not seeing yet the community

374
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,600
 of people who are prepared to put in a lot of work before the convention for a con they're

375
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 not going to be at.

376
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,280
 So I think that's something that we need to think about while we're taking virtual conventions

377
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,400
 for hybrid conventions forward.

378
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,280
 And so I was on two virtual conventions.

379
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,040
 One of them was, so how to enjoy your first walk on.

380
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,640
 Of course, because I knew nothing about air meat.

381
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,960
 Quite a lot of that was actually about how to enjoy it on air meat, which wasn't something

382
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,920
 I knew anything about.

383
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:53,680
 And then my other air meat was with Christopher J Garcia, but also with Newt Schutlkotter,

384
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,720
 who I don't know, and wasn't actually physically at the convention, but that was a very good,

385
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,320
 that was somebody who was good to meet.

386
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,120
 And they had some very interesting things to say about podcasting and community, some

387
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 building community.

388
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,480
 So I really enjoyed being on that panel with Chris and Newt.

389
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,480
 And in both the cases, would you say it was good to air meat them?

390
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:21,160
 I mean, I like, I guess people know now, I do like hybrid and virtual quite a lot.

391
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
 What?

392
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,040
 I also hung out a little bit in the fan spaces on air meat.

393
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,920
 Not as much as I would have liked, because it turned out I was quite busy hanging out

394
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,600
 in the fan spaces at the physical convention.

395
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,080
 So if I saw you in air meat, that was great.

396
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,560
 And I'm sorry, I didn't get to see more of you, but there'll be other virtual or hybrid

397
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,760
 conventions that I am at in the future, I'm sure.

398
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
 Yeah.

399
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,520
 So I mean, I did a panel on con running in the age of COVID-19, which was, in fact, like

400
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,840
 broadcast on air meat as one of the sort of live panels broadcast into the air meat.

401
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,760
 But I didn't actually do anything solely on air meat.

402
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,200
 And I wonder if there are a lot of people who said, oh yeah, I'm fine to do, you know,

403
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,080
 virtual panels, I'll be at the con in person.

404
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,720
 And then we're like, oh, actually, this is quite a lot more work to set up.

405
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,920
 And it would have been a lot easier if I was at home, and maybe that was a mistake.

406
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,900
 And you need a bit more kind of like, if you are doing a virtual panel from the con, you

407
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,000
 need to know that you kind of need to have the equipment to do it to yourself.

408
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,800
 This is not like a hybrid panel where, you know, we'll have some people a virtual and

409
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 some people in a room.

410
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,320
 It is your effectively, completely virtual.

411
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,040
 I learned on the Saturday before the convention that I would need to take my laptop with me

412
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,320
 if I wanted to do this.

413
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,960
 And we had a bit of a kind of flutter while we went.

414
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,160
 Can we possibly take my laptop with me?

415
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,520
 And we did eventually conventions.

416
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,360
 If you're having virtual participation or hyper participation, you need to let people

417
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,160
 know more than a few days before the convention, what tools they need to access your virtual

418
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
 spaces.

419
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,400
 I feel like I've got this giant clockwork key in my back and I can just round me up again.

420
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
 Right.

421
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
 You're right.

422
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 They're the big advantage of AirMeet.

423
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,080
 I think is that it could probably run with kind of fewer volunteers because roll is actually

424
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,840
 you could just do it on like zooms and discords.

425
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,560
 If you have 15 simultaneous zoom feeds running for a convention, that is a lot to manage.

426
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,040
 And the fact that AirMeet could kind of have this and it would automatically, you know,

427
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,200
 bring in rooms and things.

428
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,720
 Just having enough people to kind of know what's supposed to be going on in what room

429
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,760
 at what time is is a lot.

430
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,600
 So I think sometimes we forget that things that scale to like three streams do not scale

431
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,200
 to a world-con-sized thing.

432
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,200
 Especially they were trying to have a full thing of virtual readings and virtual table

433
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,680
 talks and everything.

434
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,200
 Yeah, I think maybe I need to be clear about, I think also they suffered from a lack of

435
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,440
 people really being setting up AirMeet in advance.

436
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,680
 And I know there was a guide on how to get on to AirMeet, but I mean, I wasn't planning

437
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,200
 to use it for any panels, so I didn't really look at it in detail.

438
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,360
 I just basically knew I wasn't going to be able to do that because I'm a convention person.

439
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,880
 I did watch a few panels on AirMeet and it was totally fine.

440
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,680
 I didn't have any problems with it, but I think that's just me.

441
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,360
 Other people had more problems.

442
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,400
 We watched the opening ceremony in our room while drinking beers and eating cold pizza.

443
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,160
 Yeah, but that wasn't actually on.

444
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,160
 AirMeet because what they did was they had a stream of that direct to YouTube.

445
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,120
 So I put the YouTube stream on the TV.

446
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,960
 Well, I went down and it was extremely busy and hadn't started yet.

447
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,680
 So I retreated and came back up to the room and found that it had started and my room

448
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,400
 was quite a lot less busy and had my wife in it.

449
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,600
 So, um, hara, that was quite good.

450
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,480
 Sadly, it also had me in, um, to ruin the moment.

451
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,360
 I didn't ruin the moment.

452
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
 Liz was good.

453
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
 She was good roommate.

454
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,920
 I mean, basically, listeners, I spent quite a long time with Liz in the States.

455
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,040
 Well, again, we'll come on to that later for shadowing.

456
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,160
 I have one more thought about my in-person events.

457
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,000
 I was on about half a dozen, mostly fan and fan related.

458
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,600
 And the kind of fan con, fanzine and fan history and fan content stuff was all pretty well

459
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
 attended, actually.

460
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,600
 These were in rooms that would seat about 50 to 100 people and they were, you know, they

461
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,480
 weren't full, but they weren't empty either.

462
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
 It was fine.

463
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,240
 Um, I was on one con running panel about organizing a good fan lounge and that was very badly attended

464
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,960
 and I heard several other people on con running panels saying that con running panels were

465
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,600
 terribly attended and I wonder whether the world con should be putting a little bit less

466
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,200
 effort into con running panels because none of the con runners have any time at a world

467
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,960
 con to go to programs.

468
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,240
 Yeah, I did two con running fannish panel.

469
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,600
 One was con running, one was about what I learned from fandom and the con running one

470
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,280
 was not particularly well attended despite having what I thought would be reasonably well

471
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,120
 known panelists on, I mean, not me, but the other ones.

472
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,560
 I thought they were bigger draws.

473
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,760
 I was on, I was on building fandom events, myths versus reality.

474
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,160
 It was me, Vince Daugherty, Michael Wallace, who was the moderator, Kathy Green and Brenda

475
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,460
 Noiseau.

476
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,720
 We were initially knocked outnumbered by the audience and that did change by the end with

477
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
 some late comers.

478
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,080
 But Vince said that one of the con running panels he'd been on earlier in the weekend,

479
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,960
 there was literally one person in the audience.

480
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,400
 The thing is, if you're a con runner and you're at world con, you're probably, especially

481
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,640
 because this panel was opposite the business meeting.

482
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,320
 And so there's an element here that a lot of the con runners who are going to world con

483
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,120
 might either be running fan tables in the dealers room for the conventions they're running

484
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,800
 or be at the business meeting trying to affect how the conventions they run will be run in

485
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
 the future.

486
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,000
 And so may not be at the con running panels.

487
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,760
 It also might be the case that a lot of the con running panels at world con seemed like

488
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,920
 quite con running 101.

489
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,800
 They weren't really going into like, they all seemed quite surface level topics.

490
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,040
 I don't know if that's fair, but like, I do wonder whether the con runners at a world

491
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,240
 con probably don't need that 101 tack and the people coming to a world con who have never

492
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,680
 run a convention before might not be going to those panels.

493
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,560
 And I don't know, and it might just be that it was bad at Chicago, but it will be great

494
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,800
 when a pegging chain do like, because it might just be a quirk of who was there.

495
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 It's hard.

496
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
 It's really hard.

497
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,560
 But yeah, they, I don't get the impression it was well attended as a sort of concept,

498
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,520
 the con running material.

499
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,920
 I thought there was some quite interesting, I mean, just to push back.

500
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,120
 So I thought there was some quite interesting con running panels, you know, there's one

501
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,360
 about mental health and con running, which I think is a good thing to be discussing about

502
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,720
 how you take care of your con runners.

503
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,760
 There was one about how we, you know, support a convention in Hindi from across the globe

504
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,640
 and running conventions in, in, you know, places where maybe they don't have great access

505
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
 for virtual conferences and things like that.

506
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,600
 So I think there were a few and then there were also some like more 101 panels.

507
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,160
 Yeah, it's really hard to tell who's going to actually attend a panel.

508
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,120
 The other thing that very surprised me about the programme coming from an Easter Connie

509
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,920
 type background is that those rooms that seat 50 to 100 people, they were mostly not miked.

510
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:08,560
 So I was in most of my items were in unmiked rooms and there's it's been ages.

511
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,360
 It's been a decade since we did this in, in Britain for the East Kong and even smaller

512
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,240
 conventions that I've run with Mike to all of our programme spaces.

513
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,320
 I think we get a lot of criticism if we asked panels to run in unmiked rooms, even quite

514
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,160
 small rooms these days.

515
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:30,640
 So I don't know if British fans are Deaf-a-on-average than US fans or if this is just a cultural thing

516
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,560
 that just hasn't quite got there yet.

517
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,960
 This is, this also leads to fewer programme streams because obviously you're then constrained

518
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,240
 by the number of, the number of rooms you can put a, a tech setup into.

519
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,600
 I mean, I have no inside information on this, but I mean, I suspect it could have just been

520
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
 budget issues.

521
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,360
 You don't quite have the budget to do something and everything.

522
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,880
 But you also for this con wanted to run lots of programme streams because you did not really

523
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,520
 want overflowing programme rooms.

524
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,920
 You ideally wanted people to have a bit more space to spread out.

525
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,560
 I think people do not want to cram themselves back into programme rooms yet.

526
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,200
 So they had the kind of extra dilemma there of, you know, fewer attendees and you would

527
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,200
 expect for a Chicago world con, but not wanting to put them into kind of a smaller space.

528
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,760
 And that is a big issue.

529
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:22,080
 On the one hand, I know that by all reports, Ch icon had troubles with their budget, which

530
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,640
 must have been very difficult.

531
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,160
 But I do think that stuff like making sure programme rooms are mic'd.

532
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,960
 And also stuff like even the big programme rooms didn't have a mic per programme participants.

533
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,440
 A lot of the time we were sort of sitting quite closely to each other so we could both

534
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
 use the same mic.

535
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,960
 And I don't know how much it costs to mic up a room for disclosure, no idea.

536
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,600
 Although I appreciate there are many reasons why it might have been difficult.

537
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,280
 I do wish it had been better done, especially because we're wearing masks.

538
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:57,240
 And so the inability to hear people is worse as anyone who's listened to the last episode

539
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,720
 of OctoThob will have heard the masks muffle you slightly, which is, you know, problematic.

540
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,000
 Also, you can't lipread if people are wearing masks, which even people with full hearing

541
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,120
 do lipread all of the time, if they can.

542
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,760
 There were parties every night, Glasgow ran a party.

543
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,320
 I think every night, except the first night was technically a Dublin party with Glasgow

544
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,360
 input and they didn't run one on like the third night maybe, but they run one every

545
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
 other night.

546
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,680
 Yeah, they didn't run one on the site selection night.

547
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,600
 And there was like other parties, there was a party with fantastic margaritas.

548
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,720
 There was the Manticorns who were running parties.

549
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,840
 There were just lots of parties.

550
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,800
 I liked the parties.

551
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:44,040
 I should shout out the Fanak and Duff 50th Anniversary Party, which was a jolly good party, which

552
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,640
 did not have wild big drinks, but did have quite nice beer and also a lot of very civilised

553
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,680
 people sitting around and chatting.

554
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,000
 I quite liked the parties.

555
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,120
 I don't like the parties when they're crowded and noisy and you can't sit down and the conversations

556
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,520
 are essentially very superficial.

557
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,280
 So I much prefer what I'd like is the situation that we once had in the UK where you sit in

558
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,080
 the bar in the earlier part of the evening and then you have room parties in the later

559
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,240
 part of the evening.

560
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,080
 I've found the early part of the parties to be rather tarsome, but once they start to

561
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,800
 thin out, they are pretty good.

562
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,240
 But then you've discovered that it's the same.

563
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,760
 It turns out that the set of drunken reprobates in room parties at two o'clock in the morning

564
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,960
 is there's a big overlap every time, right?

565
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,640
 So you get to know all these people if you do enough of it.

566
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,400
 And some of them are the same ones who would be around the bar very late at night at the

567
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
 UK convention.

568
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
 Unsurprisingly.

569
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:48,600
 Yeah, I think I just don't like the WorldCom party make up as much as definitely John

570
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,360
 doesn't possibly be Alison.

571
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,280
 You know, if the parties are great, it's great.

572
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,840
 The Glasgow parties and the Dublin Thank You party were great.

573
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,440
 But a lot of the time it's sort of you wandering into a hotel room with a few people and you

574
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,160
 know, they've done their best to put some decorations up and they'll give you a thimble

575
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,040
 full of drink or maybe even a margarita.

576
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,200
 Oh, I didn't get the margarita gone to bed and you have some more conversations.

577
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,000
 Then you go to kind of another hotel room with some decorations up, have a small drink.

578
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,080
 You know, it just I'd much rather have like a kind of bar culture where you have like

579
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,040
 one main social space where you can float about and chat to different people.

580
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,760
 And yeah, that appeals me much more than kind of going to lots of random rooms.

581
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,680
 And so I just kind of just kept going back to the Dublin party and the Glasgow parties

582
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,440
 because I had two people in there that I wanted to talk to.

583
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,800
 Like I would if they were in the bar.

584
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:43,880
 So the thing I don't like about the Eastercon bar culture is that everyone sits down and

585
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,000
 then that is it for the night.

586
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,800
 If you want to have a varied night, you have to move around the bar and at the parties

587
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,120
 because they're all parties, people move and so you have different groups of people at

588
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
 different points of the night.

589
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
 So it actually feels varied.

590
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,360
 Whereas like at an Eastercon, like often I'll be at midnight and I'd be like, I could

591
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,220
 stay here for the next two hours talking to these people and it would be more of the same

592
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,320
 or I can go to bed.

593
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,240
 And that is I never have that thought at a world con ever or not an American world con.

594
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,560
 So I do quite like that aspect of the social scene.

595
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,640
 I know a Spaniard very much values that aspect is one of the things she finds.

596
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:26,080
 She misses most about the US scene is not having that sense of like movement.

597
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,400
 Chacon might have been a little bit.

598
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,520
 So there was at least one party that I was invited to that only got started at midnight

599
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,880
 and I didn't know about because I wasn't reading the relevant person's Facebook page

600
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,120
 during the convention and there may be more of that.

601
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,080
 So there may be more parties because there weren't that many parties compare.

602
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:53,160
 I mean the parties, the parties that anticipation were quite good.

603
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,520
 There were less parties than there were at Chacon 7.

604
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,640
 There's a pandemic heart now, I said.

605
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,320
 This is probably a significant disincentive to partying for most people.

606
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,760
 Yes, that's the other thing is that the way I have fun at parties also turns out to not

607
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,560
 probably be very Covid safe.

608
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
 So that's that.

609
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,640
 Yeah, I think it sounds like I move around Eastacomba a lot more and I feel like a lot

610
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,680
 more I see a lot more of the convention there throughout the day and the evening.

611
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,920
 Whereas I felt there were a huge numbers of people at Chacon that I didn't see because

612
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,680
 they weren't at the parties and then I don't know where they are.

613
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,800
 And yeah, I think just I feel more uncomfortable, kind of randomly wandering around hotel rooms,

614
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,400
 seeing what drinks they've got and awkwardly shuffling out when I don't know anyone.

615
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,960
 Yeah, so I had to walk quickly, shuffle out from one party that I was expected to be quite

616
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,040
 a good party because I was on my own at that point and I was like, I'm perfectly happy

617
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
 to meet people on my own.

618
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,360
 But in fact, it turned out to be a room full of people that I had almost zero interest

619
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,880
 in conversing with.

620
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,120
 So, you know, probably wouldn't be better at a kind of group of three or four, which

621
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,440
 was for some of the types.

622
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,360
 Well, I think you have to be, I definitely find that if I'm in a party, I'm not enjoying

623
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
 it.

624
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
 I'm like, I'm a go.

625
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
 I don't think that's a problem.

626
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,760
 But I do think you have to be willing to be like, Oh, no, this is terrible.

627
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,320
 I'm going to go and leave now and not worry about the optics very much because no one's

628
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,320
 going to remember you.

629
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,600
 Oh, yeah, you could definitely do that.

630
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,000
 I mean, I don't think anyone cares.

631
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,600
 Yeah, they don't particularly want people in their party, not having a good time.

632
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
 So that's okay.

633
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,560
 Yeah, that could have been in a nice bar for all this time.

634
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,760
 I spent wandering around trying to find the good party.

635
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,840
 My primary motivator with the parties is that it feels different every night and it

636
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,960
 feels like there are different spaces which I enjoy.

637
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
 I don't.

638
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,280
 And like, especially on the first night where there was like the random party being thrown

639
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,760
 by the two chaps that had the throbbing box in their room with the margaritas.

640
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,880
 That was a great party because that was my favorite party of the weekend.

641
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
 It was a really interesting group of people.

642
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,200
 So several of whom I didn't know and many of whom I then met over again over the weekend

643
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,960
 because they were people who, they were the sort of people who were drinking margaritas

644
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,520
 at the time at two o'clock in the morning, you know.

645
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,720
 So I did meet some of them again and they made margaritas with a beer in them, which

646
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,360
 was kind of weird, but it was good.

647
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,520
 But it was very nice.

648
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,840
 I was thinking we get the margarita and you tip beer and tough it.

649
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,760
 No, they were making, the beer was part of like the margarita mix.

650
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,600
 It was like a sour beer and they were using it.

651
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,000
 It was part of the basis of the margarita.

652
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,560
 The margaritas were probably...

653
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
 And they tasted like margaritas.

654
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,640
 They tasted like good margaritas, but they were like a beer-based recipe.

655
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
 It was impressive.

656
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,840
 And then there was the Hugo's.

657
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
 Yes, we went to Hugo's.

658
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,120
 Oh yes.

659
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,800
 Speaking of amazing parties.

660
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,440
 The Hugo Awards ceremony was on Sunday.

661
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,320
 There was a pre-award reception where we all went and we had our photos taken and we had

662
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,720
 a drink and we could have paid $9 for extra drink, but we decided not to.

663
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,160
 And then we went into the Hugo Award ceremony itself.

664
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,960
 And then afterwards there was another reception.

665
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
 Yeah.

666
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
 With cake.

667
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,200
 Um, and my mother told me that if I can't say anything nice, I shouldn't say anything

668
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
 at all.

669
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,200
 So let's talk about the pre-award reception and the awards themselves.

670
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,680
 So the pre-award reception was good.

671
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
 There's photos of us.

672
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,000
 Hopefully they come out some point.

673
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,840
 I haven't seen any of the photos from that bit come out.

674
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
 Yeah.

675
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,920
 I've seen lots of photos of people having taken photos of people having their photo taken.

676
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,240
 But I haven't seen any of the photos that were taken.

677
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
 Yeah.

678
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,520
 We haven't seen any of the official photos.

679
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:24,760
 But I wanted to do a shout out to Castor who Cathy Bond wrote into being Hugo Award

680
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,800
 finalist liaison and had never actually been to a Worldcon before.

681
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:36,580
 And they were great the entire beforehand and through the weekend and is now on the Hugo

682
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,480
 finalist discourse going, "I am going to track down those photos for you guys."

683
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,600
 So hopefully they will track down the photos for us.

684
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,240
 I enjoyed the Hugo's.

685
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
 It was good.

686
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,520
 I remit Brendan Nwazow who I was on a panel with.

687
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,720
 But because we were both wearing our glad rags and had our hair done, neither of us

688
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,160
 recognized the other until we exchanged details.

689
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,640
 And she was like, "I already fully wore Twitter."

690
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,320
 And I was like, "I wonder why that is."

691
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,600
 And it turned out it was because we'd be all paneled together.

692
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
 Why bother, John?

693
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,480
 You hadn't added your hair, did your hair just kind of miraculously fell into awesomeness

694
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
 somehow?

695
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,720
 I put hairspray in it, Liz.

696
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
 All right.

697
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
 Did you?

698
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
 Yeah.

699
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
 It's so warm.

700
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
 It does.

701
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,520
 I put the hairband in and I leave it there for two minutes so my hair goes sticky up and

702
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,080
 then I take the hairband out and I hairspray it so it stays and then I'm done.

703
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,600
 Sarah Felix made me a tiara that took my Hugo pin as part of the decoration like tiara

704
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:34,560
 and matched the coloring and style of my dress and also my necklace and was absolutely amazing.

705
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,560
 Thank you, Sarah.

706
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
 It's unbelievable.

707
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,360
 I'm so thrilled.

708
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,120
 I bought a necklace for Hugo's in the art show basically on the morning of the Hugo's and

709
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:49,080
 it just felt very kind of serendipitous that Vanessa had a necklace in the art show which

710
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,520
 was perfect match for my dress.

711
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,600
 So thank you very much, Vanessa, for making such lovely art.

712
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,200
 So I would like to give a shout out to Tammy Coxen who had the thankless task of trying

713
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,400
 to wrangle each Hugo category, get all the finalists into one place so you can take a

714
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,200
 photo of all of them which is basically almost impossible because it's hard to wrangle a

715
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,200
 bunch of people at the better times and not when they're extremely nervous and trying

716
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,640
 to drink their $1, $9 beer and not disrupt their mask.

717
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,240
 And networking with people who might be important for their professional career or just that

718
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,160
 they've always wanted to meet furiously.

719
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,480
 I failed to meet the people that I always wanted to meet because I was too busy eating.

720
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,480
 And that is living your best life, Liz.

721
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,840
 The people I'd always wanted to meet turned out to be dumplings.

722
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
 They were bowel.

723
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,560
 There were people I wanted to meet and by the time I realised that I'd had a nice time

724
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,240
 like chatting and eating dumplings for an hour, I had not left myself any time to actually

725
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,000
 meet them, especially when I went to Lou and got back and discovered that we were now all

726
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,120
 standing around for some reason so we got good seats in the already reserved seating area.

727
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:07,680
 And in the old days at Helsinki and San Jose and Dublin, the time you met the people you

728
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,200
 had always wanted to meet was at the party after the Hugos.

729
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,560
 But the problem was that the party after the Hugos was put on by the very lovely Cheng

730
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,360
 Dubid and it consisted of the food that hadn't been eaten at the pre-awards ceremony plus

731
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,040
 some bad cake and a single flute of extremely sweet, fizzy white wine.

732
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,560
 And so I ate some cake and had my fizzy white wine and decided hmm and then went straight

733
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,960
 up to the Glasgow party which was far better in every single respect.

734
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,160
 There was about a flute of fizzy white wine per third or finalists as well.

735
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
 Yes.

736
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,440
 So there weren't enough glasses of wine for anything like everyone who was there.

737
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,480
 It took us a while to realise that what we should have done was all brought a straw and

738
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,720
 drunk the fizzy white wine, three of us with a straw each and take the photo as is the

739
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,480
 octaloped tradition.

740
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,680
 Unfortunately we had one each like reprobates.

741
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,840
 It basically did not encourage people to stick around after the ceremony and hang out.

742
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,720
 And that was a very great shame because one of the very good things about the parties

743
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,840
 at 2017, 18 and 19 was that everyone was hanging out afterwards as you had time to

744
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,800
 get drunk enough to go up to defeat digs and be like you're really good.

745
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,440
 Which I'm sure was less fun for defeat digs than it was for everyone else.

746
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,520
 But like you know.

747
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,880
 I think I did that at Helsinki and I just did it in the bar.

748
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,600
 Oh yeah, that also works.

749
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,280
 I mean I think you've been spoiled by going to three losers parties that had a large budget

750
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,600
 then because the loser party was pretty much the same as like the official Helsinki run

751
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,480
 losers party in 2016 which is you know with the best will in the world they could not

752
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,480
 compare with someone hiring an offsite venue and putting a lot of money into it.

753
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,680
 And I mean what I've said is the downside of there being the fancy offsite losers party

754
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,200
 is it meant that anyone who didn't get nominated for Hugo could not hang out with anyone who

755
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,600
 was nominated for Hugo.

756
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
 Yeah.

757
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,440
 Because basically for those years the people who won and the losers would all kind of go

758
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,280
 off to that party and you didn't really see them.

759
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,560
 So it was really nice to be able to go up to Glasgow party and then just hang out with

760
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,280
 you know a bunch of people who were just at the come.

761
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,720
 No I mean that is fair but I had done that for the previous three nights so there is an

762
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,200
 element where I was like oh you know nice party would have been good.

763
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:35,520
 I went to better budgeted Hugo losers parties in 2005 and in 2014 and they still weren't

764
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:42,880
 the George RR Martin huge budget kind but they were they were significantly better budgeted

765
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
 than this one was.

766
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,640
 Do you mean the one in 2014 or the one run by 2014?

767
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:53,240
 The one in 2014 which was the Spokane one which we did think was pretty bad at the time

768
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,920
 but it did go on quite a lot longer than this one did.

769
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,760
 Yeah but you were my all the way.

770
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:05,040
 Yeah because the Chengdu one I think even the people like us who are on the kind of low

771
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,240
 end of the Hugo prestige scale had left after half an hour.

772
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,320
 I remember being at the one in Reno in 2011 and that one went for like an hour and a half

773
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,680
 two hours because you I mean like there was a bar and you got a couple of free drinks

774
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,480
 afterwards and so people did stick around and it and so like obviously the ones run by

775
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,560
 George RR Martin were fantastic and there was a lot of money spent but I do think that

776
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,040
 there is a like the Chengdu one didn't have a bar.

777
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,040
 Yeah.

778
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,040
 What like have someone selling drinks?

779
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,040
 I'm not saying it has to be a million pound party thrown by a millionaire for all his mates

780
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:44,000
 that's like in the ritziest place in the city but I do think it needs to be more than some

781
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,160
 sad cake.

782
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,800
 I mean I think you also have to take into account that there are probably twice as many people

783
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,440
 invited to the Hugo Luther party than there were in 2014 or 2005.

784
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,160
 Oh maybe but you also have to take into account the Chengdu have an awful lot of US dollars

785
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,960
 that they cannot spend and so realistically speaking.

786
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,120
 It's true they could have spent all the US dollars.

787
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,320
 They could have had a few beers yes.

788
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,200
 Glasgow did a consistently better job every night.

789
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:16,200
 Yeah I was going to say they rather less good party than the 50th anniversary of Duff and

790
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,000
 Falak party okay.

791
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 Yeah fair enough.

792
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 I mean yeah they should probably like there's got to be an in between where you know we

793
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,720
 can't have you know really super fancy parties but just something with a bit more gets a bit

794
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:35,040
 more socialization going rather than I'm going to drink my own glass of wine and then run away.

795
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,760
 Yeah you do need to put drink into your Hugo finalists after the ceremony because they're

796
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,000
 going to need sorry we're all starting like alcoholics here.

797
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,280
 Can I skip back to the Hugo rehearsal now because I forgot to mention it.

798
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
 Yeah go on.

799
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,440
 So the first is that it was our one chance to hold a Hugo we should have made a bit more

800
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,960
 of that and taken some photos then we got some photos with the.

801
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,800
 Well also two of us didn't told you goes.

802
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,000
 I held a Hugo at the Glasgow party after the Hugo's.

803
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,280
 I did I and I've got photos because the June Hugo was passed around to everyone who wanted

804
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
 to touch it.

805
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,120
 I have photos of John with the June Hugo which are available for a very low price.

806
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,520
 This is not the cover up to this episode.

807
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,720
 No no you can cut that if that is too much but you know.

808
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,760
 Nope I take solace and joy from that.

809
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,880
 So I sat down next to a man and started making at the rehearsal and started making kind of

810
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,440
 a pleasant conversation as you do and he was wearing a basket.

811
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,440
 I was wearing a basket.

812
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,280
 It wasn't the brightest room and after some time I realized it was Charlie Stross who I

813
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,240
 have known for 30 years.

814
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,920
 Yes I did see that and I was like I recognized it was Charlie Stross.

815
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,040
 Yeah I recognized him from behind as being Charlie Stross.

816
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,040
 I probably would have recognized him from behind right.

817
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,480
 Yeah well because and I don't know if you know this Alison Charlie Stross looks a lot

818
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,800
 like Charlie Stross like a lot like Charlie Stross even with a mask on.

819
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,640
 I might have been a bit struck out but also he didn't recognize me and again we have known

820
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,560
 each other you know we we've been to each other's houses we know each other fairly well.

821
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:17,680
 He had a good reason to be struck out he was up he was up for a Hugo and his Hugo's matter

822
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,440
 for his publication and like agents and our Hugo was just a little bit of a laugh.

823
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,600
 Although he might he had a good chance of winning a Hugo.

824
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,840
 How long do you go?

825
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,440
 Congratulations to Anna Lee and Charlie Jane for winning Best Fancast.

826
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,400
 Congratulations to Cora Bueller for winning Best Fan Writer and congratulations to Sean

827
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,240
 and McGuire and Lee Moyer for winning the other two fan categories.

828
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,080
 I was glad to see how well represented fandom was across the fan categories I think it's

829
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,920
 really great and tribute to the Hugo's.

830
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,000
 For anyone who has not looked at the the detailed results which we did approximately one second

831
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,360
 after the detailed results were made available.

832
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,400
 Which was approximately ten minutes after they ought to have been.

833
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,320
 There is a general there is a general thing people saying or maybe the statistics should

834
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,040
 not be available immediately because I think some people read them then then you know our

835
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,000
 souls to finalists about what is contained in them.

836
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,600
 But I think if the results had come out any later Alison would literally have exploded.

837
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:19,040
 One of the very few cast-on memories I have of my first Worldcon which was 1987 and I'm

838
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:25,640
 also really doing any fan act apart from Go to Parties then was leaving the Hugo Awards

839
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,600
 which I've found a bit kind of dull and then somebody handing me the sheet of paper with

840
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,480
 the long list on and I going oh but this is good.

841
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,600
 So it is one of the things that is very caught by a sense of who I am as a fan and what I

842
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,520
 value about fandom is that piece of paper or now electronic link.

843
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:50,280
 Though I did manage to get one of the ten pieces of paper that Nicholas had wickedly

844
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,160
 run off so there would be some printed copies.

845
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,680
 I would say I think I would be fine with it coming out the next morning in general.

846
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,680
 But yes I do like it.

847
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,240
 And it's because it's kind of when I was a baby fan it was kind of the fact that the

848
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,640
 long list comes out instantly was imprinted on my hand brain and I now follow it around

849
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,640
 like a baby duck.

850
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:15,320
 Yep you often strike me as a baby duck because you're quite a lot smaller than me and you've

851
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,480
 got a very pronounced bill.

852
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,640
 [Barking]

853
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,400
 Right shall we do pics?

854
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,640
 No because I'm still going to tell people where we came in the Hugos.

855
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,640
 Oh yeah tell people where we came in the Hugos Liz.

856
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,760
 The whole point of being that up was to say have you analysed the stats Liz you're going

857
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,640
 to do a statistical research and charts maybe.

858
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,640
 No because every time you say you're going to do a chart I'm less likely to make a chart.

859
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,240
 [Laughter]

860
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,480
 Because I listen was like you're going to make a chart right like 10 minutes after the Hugos

861
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,680
 and so now every time I listen to Ryan's me I'm like well I'm that ping-poo gift off

862
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,680
 well now I'm not doing it.

863
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,680
 But we came fifth.

864
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,320
 So thank you very much everyone who voted for us.

865
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:59,480
 Yes we managed to come fifth by one single vote which is quite exciting.

866
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,440
 Because otherwise we'd have been dead flat last.

867
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:10,280
 And we did also get 46 nominations so even though we voted to ratify and keep EPH we

868
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,440
 actually didn't hear this year to get on the ballot.

869
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,360
 So that was very nice to see.

870
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,360
 Yes.

871
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,640
 Thank everyone I will do more Hugo.

872
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,560
 I will do more Hugo stats and error in the future at some point.

873
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,840
 I would also like to say thank you to everyone who voted in the fan categories because they

874
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,120
 were all awarded and that was great.

875
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:35,120
 And congratulations to Hugo Girl our bestest friends now who were third.

876
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,120
 Yes.

877
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:40,280
 Because we're basically like well we can't win maybe Hugo Girl will win.

878
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,560
 That seems a bit grateful now because neither of us did but yes.

879
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,560
 Yes so it was good.

880
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,560
 [Laughter]

881
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,240
 Did we mention how much fun we had hanging out with the Hugo Girl people?

882
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,560
 It was very good.

883
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:56,840
 Especially I hung out with Hailey on her last night all the way till four o'clock.

884
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,520
 Or 30th of the morning when she had to go and catch her plane.

885
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,520
 That was really good.

886
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,680
 There are not photographs.

887
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,680
 That was at the Glasgow party.

888
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,960
 See that's what you should have done on your last night instead of sneaking out of John's

889
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,960
 room at five o'clock in the morning list.

890
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,600
 You should have ported until five o'clock in the morning.

891
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,200
 We went for ice cream.

892
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,960
 You know you're complaining Hailey's last night and Liz's last night were different last

893
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,800
 night so Liz.

894
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,880
 There were no parties on that night apart from I guess I could have tried to sneak into

895
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,800
 old farts party at 4am.

896
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,800
 No.

897
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,200
 I should have gone to the old farts actually if that was that night.

898
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,200
 I was asleep.

899
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,280
 I was asleep as well because I was about to spend 32 hours returning home and so I thought

900
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,040
 maybe you know six hours sleep would help.

901
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,480
 I was asleep because I was going to get on a plane from Chicago to Orlando and go straight

902
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,480
 back to Star Wars which is an excellent segue into pics.

903
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,480
 [Laughter]

904
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,480
 I'll go to where Star Wars after you two so do you want to do your pics first?

905
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,520
 Is this a pic or is this like a special three hour explanation of why John loves Galaxy

906
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,520
 set?

907
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,520
 Oh no I mean I did.

908
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,160
 I've written it all up Liz and that will be available to anyone who stays still too long

909
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
 at Eastacom.

910
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:12,480
 My pic this episode is Robert Jackson Bennett's Founders Trilogy which I finished on the plane

911
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,840
 home from Chicago and left me in the embarrassing situation of having a little cry on a plane

912
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,320
 because it was that good.

913
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,000
 So it is a fancy trilogy.

914
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,200
 I really like Robert Jackson Bennett's previous fancy trilogy which was nominated for a Hugo

915
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,320
 for Best Series in 2018.

916
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,720
 This is his follow up.

917
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:39,280
 It's essentially about it's a city state which runs on a kind of magic called scribing

918
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:46,080
 which essentially you can, the magic system is you write commands onto physical objects

919
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,320
 and it alters the way they interact with reality.

920
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:55,520
 So the first novel is essentially sort of a series of heists to try and steal a very powerful

921
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,600
 artifact from a thief who can look at scribed objects and know what's going on and it all

922
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,960
 interacts with these merchant houses and they end up stealing this prize artifact but it's

923
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,920
 things like you know you can essentially fly by making yourself a scribe gravity rig which

924
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,120
 thinks temporarily that gravity is going in the opposite direction and things like this.

925
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,280
 So there's a huge amount of very fun ideas in there and that's just the first book but

926
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,800
 then in the second one they get more deeply into okay so you can basically tell objects

927
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,760
 to rewrite the laws of reality.

928
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:32,720
 What else can you do by rewriting the laws of reality and it gets really deep into what

929
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,040
 if you could rewrite the laws of reality surrounding people and what if you can get really deeply

930
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,760
 into kind of you know rewriting reality itself.

931
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,600
 I'm not really doing it justice because it is like an entire fantasy trilogy about this.

932
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,040
 It sounds very interesting.

933
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,840
 It's kind of a really great idea that doesn't just like do three books using this great idea

934
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,280
 but then kind of each book it's building on it's like well what if I took this and then

935
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,360
 kind of showed you what my imagination thinks we could do with this.

936
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:04,240
 Plus it's also got great characters in there a lot of them get really character arcs and

937
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,840
 a really good send off or pay off at the end you know by the end of it I'm basically crying

938
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:16,200
 over a magical artifact so yeah I will definitely be nominating it for best series I may put

939
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,040
 the last volume lock lands on my best novel ballot and I think it's I can recommend everyone

940
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,200
 read it now because it's finished and it's six landing.

941
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:31,200
 And I read Bennett's previous trilogy which was the Divine Cities because it was nominated

942
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:38,000
 for best series in 2018 and at the time I thought it was an incredibly good example of

943
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,560
 the sort thing I think should be nominated in that category.

944
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,960
 I remember thinking it was amazing it lost out to Lois McMaster Boozjold.

945
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,640
 I had not realized that that trilogy had wrapped up but now I do know it has wrapped

946
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:56,640
 up I may have to read that in my pre Hugo nomination reading next year so thank you Liz.

947
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,720
 The previous trilogy was amazing I really really really enjoyed it.

948
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:07,520
 Yeah I would say this is as good and it's kind of recognizably the same but also very

949
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,600
 different and maybe interested in some different ideas.

950
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,800
 So as well as go to the Worldcon John and Liz also went to Orlando to do Disney things

951
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:21,240
 you might hear a bit more about those in a minute and I have massive massive FOMO because

952
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:27,440
 I had checked my bank account before booking my Chicago holiday and I knew that I could

953
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,440
 not possibly have added an extra week in Orlando or indeed anything else to the holiday.

954
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,320
 So I thought oh this is and then they kept going well you don't you know interactive

955
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,400
 things are amazing and immersives are amazing and you should do more of the malice and I

956
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,160
 was like oh oh I should.

957
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,680
 So what we did was we booked a trip for the family to a place called Phantom Peak which

958
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:57,040
 is an immersive at Canada Water where for the princely sum of 34 pounds you can run around

959
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,840
 for an evening in what the one-star reviews say is an overpriced theme bar and the five-star

960
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:11,920
 reviews say is a fantastic cross between a escape room and a bar and a theme park and

961
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,200
 a lop and I had a fantastic time.

962
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,680
 One of the other reviews said we did some of the trails but then we sat in the bar for

963
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,800
 the rest of the evening while our children ran around and did a load of water trails

964
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,080
 and that sounded like quite a good way to experience it because I think they have about

965
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:32,880
 16 trails in total which are all of the form such and such a weird thing has happened.

966
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,840
 Go and find this person to talk to who will tell you the next stage of your fetch quest

967
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,840
 and you do this for a bit and you end up with very sore feet.

968
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,480
 I hit by rings.

969
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,760
 If you go in a weekday it's 34 pounds and the beer is pretty good and they also have

970
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:55,280
 got trails and we had a splendid time so if you're anywhere near Docklands that's a

971
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,960
 jolly good night out I would say and we were put on to it by Fiona Moore and Caroline

972
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,320
 Mersey and Russell Smith who had all been and you don't have to dress up but we did

973
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,960
 dress up just the tiniest bit and I think that helps as well and it was a lot of fun.

974
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:17,720
 It is a sort of steampunk Westworld themed town organized around one of the old docks

975
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,000
 so it uses Docklands in quite an interesting way and there's kind of there's a hooker

976
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,320
 platypus game and a really weird boat ride where Marianne got absolutely soaking wet

977
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,280
 because they had calculated that three adults could go on this boat ride but they did not

978
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:38,840
 think they would weigh as much as three of us so it was quite wobbly, wobbly that they

979
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,760
 thought we got a lot of water in.

980
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,000
 There's a whole backstory it is so it's fictional because there has been a blimp crash and there

981
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,120
 is some weird stuff going on in the town and you kind of learn about this through the

982
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,960
 setup trails but as well as the setup trails there's quite a lot of meta story as well

983
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,800
 that's not in any of the trails which is kind of weird so now I want to go back and do a

984
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,800
 bit more of it and strongly recommended if you're in the area.

985
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,040
 I'm very excited at some point to do it probably not this month.

986
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,560
 I assume it's going to be around for a while I assume it's not a limited time thing.

987
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:17,240
 Well, except for insofar as any business is a limited time thing.

988
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,200
 But they might go bust because I don't see how they're going to sell only tickets in

989
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,200
 the winter.

990
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,560
 Why wouldn't they sell tickets in the winter?

991
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,560
 Because it's outdoors.

992
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:30,760
 I mean it's under cover but it's in a dock so you're kind of running around the dock.

993
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,120
 I think I am less worried about being outside of the winter than you.

994
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,200
 Yeah, he said you got very wet right?

995
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,920
 People won't do that in the winter.

996
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,240
 You were not supposed to get wet.

997
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,200
 Our anger wet on the boat ride because we overbalanced the boat because they should

998
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,640
 have put two of us on one boat and two of us on the other.

999
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,320
 But there's no log flumes because when you said that I was imagining a log flume but

1000
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,680
 I'm now not imagining a log flume.

1001
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,080
 No, it's not like a theme park.

1002
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,600
 It's not like a theme park.

1003
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,160
 It's much closer to being a lop than it is to being a theme park.

1004
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,720
 Although there's some kind of infrastructure, mostly what you're doing is talking to the

1005
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,760
 inhabitants of the town about their lives and why they're there and what they're doing

1006
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,240
 there and why they came there and where they're going and so on.

1007
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:17,720
 But I was going to say I think 35 pounds for something with a lot of actors that is quite

1008
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,720
 cheap.

1009
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,960
 That is quite cheap.

1010
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,400
 It's just starting at 34 pounds but I don't understand what that means.

1011
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,520
 Yeah, it's 34 pounds on a weekday and I think it's about 49 at the weekend and they do

1012
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,280
 two, you're there for five hours so they do two sitting daytime one which will be full

1013
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,600
 of children I'll tell you and then an evening one which probably won't be.

1014
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,200
 It's only 39 pounds at the weekend.

1015
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,400
 They should charge more for this.

1016
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,040
 And do they sell you a lot of beer?

1017
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,920
 Yeah, no, and they saw me two beers but the beers were six pounds a pint which I would

1018
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,520
 say for four pure, it's perfectly good brand.

1019
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,480
 I would say six pounds a pint for beer.

1020
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,000
 A) I'd just be in a Chicago.

1021
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,480
 And B) if you go to a bar in that area of London you will be paying five pounds fifty

1022
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,480
 a pint so it didn't seem ludicrously expensive at all.

1023
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,120
 Yeah, so they're not making pocket loads on their drinks either.

1024
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,960
 They originally had a rather poor food offering that was expensive but they've improved the

1025
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,320
 food offering and although we didn't actually eat there we ate at a, there's a food caught

1026
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:21,680
 outside Canada water station and we had some food off of Van there because we'd been warned.

1027
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:26,040
 But so we didn't actually taste the food inside but we just have hacked into Lato.

1028
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:31,680
 I have an adorable picture of their sample codes which have tiny crocheted platypuses

1029
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,440
 at the rather than ice cream.

1030
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,000
 No, I want to go.

1031
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,480
 I would want to dress up because it is a steampunk world and the worst thing about that kind

1032
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,480
 of thing is when you've got a lot of people wearing like band t-shirts and jeans and

1033
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,080
 you're like this does not feel very steampunky so I would definitely want to at least make

1034
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,600
 the effort to match the aesthetic.

1035
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,080
 I think a lot of these things you get out what you put in so like I'd be very up for

1036
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,080
 doing that.

1037
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,960
 I've never been tempted to go to like a lop like empire or anything like that but I think

1038
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,840
 with this kind of thing where it's like you pay money and do it more as a theatre production

1039
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,440
 tempts me a lot more because I think I would have to put less in to get more out than of

1040
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,840
 a traditional art.

1041
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,920
 Yeah, I think 100%.

1042
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,760
 Okay, do you pick John?

1043
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,760
 My pick.

1044
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,160
 What is your pick John?

1045
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,520
 So I would see Liz for a week and Liz is great and my pick is Liz.

1046
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
 Hey.

1047
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:29,840
 So in 2020 me and my family were going to go to Orlando to go to Walt Disney World, partly

1048
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:36,240
 to visit Galaxy's Edge and do other things and obviously Covid got in the way and our

1049
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:41,760
 Virgin Atlantic ticket was made into an open ticket that we had to spend by mid 2022 and

1050
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,120
 then we got nominated for a Hugo Award.

1051
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:50,000
 And so long story short, I went on a family holiday to Orlando and then flew from that

1052
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,080
 family holiday to Worldcon to kill two birds with one stone and Liz was there as well because

1053
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,080
 Liz had some time before Worldcon where she was like, well, I could do a thing in America

1054
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:05,840
 and I said, I'll go to Orlando and Liz went, I like Disney and so Liz was in Orlando also.

1055
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,680
 And so I've got a life hack for jet lag, which is if you get off the plane in Orlando and

1056
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:15,000
 immediately go and hang out for three hours at a water park with Liz eating Mickey Mouse

1057
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,960
 ice creams, that gets you over jet lag instantly.

1058
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,400
 So if you're ever flying to the States, just contact Liz, ask her to meet you at a water

1059
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,480
 park in America somewhere and feed you ice cream and you'll be right as Wayne.

1060
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,960
 And so we went to Star Wars Galaxy's Edge the next day and it was pretty great.

1061
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,800
 I've very much enjoyed it.

1062
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,640
 Those of who have been listening to the podcast for a while may know that I quite like Star

1063
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,760
 Wars on the plane to America.

1064
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:46,080
 I read the Galaxy's Edge novel, so I was like prepared for Galaxy's Edge when I arrived

1065
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,680
 and then we went on the first day, we went to Oga's cantina, which is a Star Wars cantina

1066
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,040
 in Galaxy's Edgeland and it was so cool and they have like Star Wars drinks and they

1067
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,280
 have beer flights and they have Tiki mugs and it was amazing.

1068
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,440
 And then they also have kind of they're basically the entire places like being in Star Wars

1069
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,040
 and they use sound effects very cleverly.

1070
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,040
 So there's like sounds of starships going overhead as you're walking around.

1071
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:16,040
 And I went with a friend after Chicago by coincidence, my friend from uni Fred was on holiday.

1072
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:22,040
 In Orlando at that point, so we went to Galaxy together and his partner remarked saying,

1073
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:26,560
 "I've only just properly twigged that when I hear starships going overhead, they're not

1074
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:32,240
 actually starships, they're sound effects because it is so immersive that you just don't

1075
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,040
 really notice that it's not real.

1076
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,480
 It was very good.

1077
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:39,200
 There is an app which you could download which has an augmented reality game you can play

1078
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,600
 throughout the park.

1079
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,120
 I didn't really do that as much on the first day but I did a lot of it on previous things.

1080
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:48,040
 There are two rides both of which designed to be relatively accessible even to people

1081
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,880
 who don't really like rides.

1082
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,600
 This band is not a huge fan of roller coasters but enjoyed both a lot.

1083
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,280
 It was really, really good.

1084
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,280
 And yeah.

1085
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,240
 Did you dress up?

1086
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,720
 No, I didn't.

1087
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,080
 I haven't got a Star Wars cosplay at the moment.

1088
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:07,960
 Don't you think that dressing up and having there not be lots of people walking around

1089
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:14,440
 in jeans and t-shirts is just as important in a Star Wars immersive as it is in Steampunk?

1090
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,280
 I'm just wondering.

1091
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,600
 Yes, but I have a question for you.

1092
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:24,680
 In the London Docklands in mid September, was it 40 degrees?

1093
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,680
 No.

1094
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:31,800
 There is an element here of you're going to be very warm in August in Orlando as it turns

1095
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
 out.

1096
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,600
 But there are places, I've seen Star Wars.

1097
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,840
 There are places in the Star Wars universe that are 40 degrees.

1098
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,880
 There must be appropriate clothing in those places.

1099
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:44,680
 Well, mostly if you live in that kind of place all the time you get used to the heat, right?

1100
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:50,120
 I mean, the appropriate clothing for wearing to a theme park in Orlando in August is basically

1101
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,240
 as little as possible and incredibly sturdy shoes.

1102
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,240
 Yeah.

1103
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:00,200
 It doesn't really feel like it destroys the immersion somehow.

1104
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,120
 I mean, also bear in mind that Star Wars Galaxy's Edge is only one small part of a

1105
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,840
 much larger theme park as well.

1106
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,480
 So most people are not spending their entire day most in Galaxy's Edge.

1107
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,520
 They're going there for a couple of hours and then going off to ride the Slinky Dog World

1108
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
 Acosta.

1109
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:20,800
 I spent a large amount of my day in Galaxy's Edge and then I spent a further five days

1110
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,120
 in Galaxy's Edge going back and doing all the things because there is a game and I did

1111
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,120
 the game.

1112
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,880
 I haven't quite finished the game so I'm going to have to go back.

1113
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,880
 This is very sad.

1114
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,800
 But yeah, so there's two, there's a ride where you can ride the Millennium Falcon and

1115
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:40,280
 you get to fly or be the gunner or be the mechanic on a smuggling run to Corellia and

1116
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,800
 that's very cool.

1117
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:46,360
 I got to fly the Vulcan on my own because I went on the single rider queue and I got

1118
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,280
 to the front and there was literally no one else because I think they just had a breakdown

1119
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,160
 and they just reopened and they were like, do you just want to do it on your own?

1120
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,240
 And I was like, yes.

1121
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,600
 And so I did all my own and it was brilliant.

1122
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,800
 And then there's Rise of Resistance, which I don't want to talk too much about but is

1123
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,800
 amazing.

1124
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,040
 I wish I'd been able to go with my friend but unfortunately I had to fly back to London

1125
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,040
 because the day I went with him was the day we were flying home.

1126
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:13,720
 But I said, what was your face like when you got off the shuttle in Rise and he sent

1127
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,520
 me a photo of him being like this?

1128
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,360
 And I was like, yes, that is a correct face.

1129
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,360
 It does sound amazing.

1130
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,040
 It does sound like, and Disney generally does sound like it would be amazingly good.

1131
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,480
 I don't want to suggest it would be.

1132
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,880
 It is quite fun.

1133
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,400
 And Rise of Resistance isn't broken, which unfortunately is a lot.

1134
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,920
 It is technologically incredible.

1135
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:40,120
 There are things where I can only vaguely work out how they are doing those effects.

1136
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,360
 And it is really good.

1137
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,960
 I was saying you would love it because there's so many visual illusions and things like that.

1138
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,520
 You would be like, oh, how are they doing this hologram?

1139
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,080
 Yeah, I'm saving up my pennies.

1140
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,480
 I'm going to do it.

1141
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,000
 But you know, and also I love all of that.

1142
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:58,240
 I also love like, I love stuff that was state of the art in 1872 as well.

1143
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:04,160
 So even if I don't get to go until it's quite old hat, I'll still like it.

1144
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:09,800
 And then I went to get, I went to do the lightsaber, which is kind of a ride you can't

1145
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,120
 do unless you spend a lot of money on a lightsaber.

1146
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,000
 Liz, so you get a plus one?

1147
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,400
 Well, aren't all of these rides you can't do unless you spend a lot of money going to

1148
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,400
 a theme park?

1149
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,840
 Well, yeah, but the most of them aren't extra money when you get in.

1150
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,320
 It's not the rollercoaster tycoon model of charge them when they enter and then charge

1151
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,520
 them again when they ride.

1152
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,280
 Yeah, but could you now eBay your lightsaber?

1153
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,920
 Oh, yeah, but I don't want to.

1154
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,920
 Yeah.

1155
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,960
 But yeah, and so it's like a kind of like a little miniature theatrical thing with like

1156
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:43,000
 actors and like the speeches perfectly lined up with these sound cues and the lighting.

1157
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,960
 I don't know what to spoil it to, actually, but it was pretty freaking amazing.

1158
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,840
 And España was my plus one.

1159
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,760
 And Liz was my little brother's plus one because my little brother's wife was like,

1160
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,760
 you do you.

1161
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,240
 So the lightsaber was very good.

1162
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,000
 And very sad I just had a whale of a time.

1163
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:04,320
 I kind of have this question of, oh, but what wasn't it that everybody else buying a lightsaber

1164
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,840
 was a seven year old, but I'm sure that's not actually true.

1165
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,920
 No, I think I don't think and I think there were a couple of kids, but it was definitely

1166
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,920
 majority.

1167
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,640
 It's like collectors Lego.

1168
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,640
 Yeah, it is.

1169
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,440
 Yeah, I mean, if your kid just wants a lightsaber, you can buy them a $25 plastic lightsaber.

1170
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,440
 That's the other thing.

1171
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,680
 Because like if you've got a child who wants a lightsaber, buy them a metal one that comes

1172
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:30,960
 with the 36 inch long light bulb on the end is like, yeah.

1173
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:37,480
 I could go to Disney when I was 14 to Disney World and it was very good then.

1174
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,240
 But I feel like they might have a couple of new rides and new attractions.

1175
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,960
 That was 1979 and Star Wars, Star Wars was an enormous thing, but they didn't have a

1176
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,960
 thing.

1177
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,960
 It wasn't owned by Disney.

1178
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,360
 When did Star Tours open?

1179
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,360
 Late 80s.

1180
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,360
 87, yeah.

1181
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:57,800
 Yeah, it's possible that they have a few more rides and stuff than they had in 1979

1182
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,600
 hours and had Space Mountain.

1183
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,640
 Still have Space Mountain.

1184
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:06,360
 And also they hadn't really, I think they've got a lot better at managing queues.

1185
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,440
 So one of the things about Phantom Peak is of course no queues really.

1186
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:14,800
 There was a very sad bit where somebody was waiting to talk to the guy.

1187
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,880
 We were getting to the end of a quest and getting our pay off for the end of the quest,

1188
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,920
 which is playing cards that you can keep.

1189
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,800
 And there were some people waiting to talk to him and they were clearly at the very beginning

1190
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,080
 of the same quest.

1191
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,000
 So that was not great.

1192
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,200
 Yeah, that is tricky.

1193
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,280
 One of my abiding memories about Disney was that even then they were better at managing

1194
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,680
 queues than any other theme parker.

1195
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,720
 I went to quite a lot of theme parks.

1196
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,720
 But there were a lot of queues.

1197
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:44,280
 I remember, I mean, we must have spent more than half our time at Disney World in queues.

1198
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,840
 Then you need to get up earlier in solution.

1199
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:51,480
 No, no, we got into the park at the first moment that you could get into the park.

1200
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,480
 I mean, this was 1979.

1201
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,640
 They didn't have all of the fast pass and...

1202
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,280
 Oh, they don't have fast pass anymore.

1203
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,280
 They're at anymore.

1204
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,280
 You've got to pay.

1205
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:04,560
 And the Port Marion thing, which we got to do this year, which is that if you're a privileged

1206
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,720
 person at Port Marion, you get to hang out in the village after everyone's left.

1207
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,480
 And I think Disney do that right.

1208
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,480
 Before everyone arises, after everyone leaves.

1209
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,480
 Yep.

1210
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,480
 Only if you're Liz.

1211
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,480
 Which I did.

1212
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,000
 Because Liz is very special.

1213
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,800
 John joined me one morning and, you know, we were there half an hour before the scheduled

1214
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,840
 opening, which was the early opening.

1215
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,840
 And it was already open.

1216
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,920
 You basically just like, if you arrived at the time, they say the theme park opens.

1217
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,920
 You were late.

1218
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,400
 So that's the way to do it.

1219
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,400
 I don't think we...

1220
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,840
 I don't know about you, John, but I did not spend a lot of time in queues.

1221
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,640
 I mean, I queued for half an hour for Rises since that first day, but that's about it.

1222
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,960
 The only time I queued for a long time was when I queued for Rises resistance and it broke

1223
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,680
 down while I was queuing.

1224
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,960
 That was a long queue.

1225
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:53,440
 But especially because if you go to theme parks, I just single ride on most things.

1226
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,720
 And those, like, you go from, like, some queue to basically zero.

1227
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,400
 Going as a single rider is so much quicker.

1228
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,680
 We went on and I think all but one Disney ride, which have a single rider queue, John.

1229
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,680
 They don't have them.

1230
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,080
 Oh, no.

1231
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,160
 That was the Octa Thought podcast.

1232
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,640
 And it's goodbye for me.

1233
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,200
 It's goodbye for me.

1234
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:12,880
 It's goodbye for me.

1235
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:34,600
