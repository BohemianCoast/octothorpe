00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
 Right, people I actually know might be listening to this podcast, John. I think that is over

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:18,080
 my rudeness line. Sorry, John. Sorry, Liz. It was quite funny. It is quite funny.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:37,440
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 70th episode of Oxford though, the podcast for science

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,000
 fiction and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 10th of November 2022.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,280
 I'm John Cox and I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and we have some letters of comments.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,120
 That we have two episodes worth of letters of comment because actually we sneakily recorded

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,480
 69 before you had listened to 68 bonus letters all around. Dude, because Raj says that the correct

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:12,000
 response to 69 is dude as per Messers, Preston and Logan and that is fair comment Raj. When there

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,120
 is a genre call back, we should always do the genre one, right? Yeah, that's fair.

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,400
 Isn't that like a very gendered biased comment? I think we established quite early on that

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,400
 chaps was gender neutral. I believe it was an episode title. Yes, so dudes is also gender neutral.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,320
 For the purposes of responding to the number 69 in a feminist way, I feel that dudes can be

13
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,000
 gender neutral. Write in feminists, all of you. No, no, no, it's okay.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,600
 Listeners won't know this but Liz has recently received, recently purchased two new fountain pens

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,800
 so she can write twice. You can also do that mirror writing where you have a fountain pen in

16
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,960
 each hand and and be your chorolean. So Raj also notes there were no graphs and I did forget to do

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,040
 the graphs. Basically it's just been, I don't know, the world seemed to have been very manic in the

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,120
 last few months and so I forgot to do the graphs. I'm very sorry, I will do graphs for next time.

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,320
 Well they're going to be graphs. They were going to be graphs. I'm going to do a graph of the

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:22,240
 bimodal distribution of the Hugo voting and I completely forgot. Yeah. So I will do that, I promise.

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,840
 And then what makes Discovery the worst space shuttle other than being in a big garage?

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,360
 And that is the only thing. Like I don't have a beef with Discovery's track record as a scientific

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,440
 vehicle. It is just the way it is displayed. I think if you're going to go and see the space

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,520
 shuttles there are more exciting space shuttles to see museum-wise. Give us your ranking of space

25
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,880
 shuttles which are the most exciting, from most exciting to least exciting museum-wise, please John.

26
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,600
 Atlantis is the best space shuttle and then I think Endeavour is the second best space shuttle

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,760
 and Discovery is the third best. I haven't seen Enterprise yet. I've only just started Voyager

28
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,080
 but I'll get there eventually. That was a joke listeners. You can tell from the fact that both

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,320
 Alison and Liz are studiously ignoring it. Do you have a tumbleweed thing to put on your

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,480
 stream deck? You know I could get a stream deck and then I could just press the tumbleweed button

31
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,520
 every time John makes a joke. Hahaha yep I'm down. And then John will edit them straight out again.

32
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:36,320
 Oh we need to do a guest as it Liz. Problem is that would be work so it's not likely to happen.

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,920
 Raj wrote to us about episode 68 and says that he disagrees with me listening from number one

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,640
 was a brilliant experience and says that we're all going to get drinks out of it so recommends

35
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,640
 against discouraging it too much and that a naked self-interest is a powerful motivator.

36
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,240
 When are we seeing you Raj? I mean presumably Eastercom.

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,040
 Wow yeah you could definitely pass drinks. I mean and if Liz isn't there we will have Liz's drink

38
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,840
 for her and because we're heroes. And we can phone her up. We can drink Liz's drink at her.

39
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,560
 There will be no phoning me up while you are drinking my drinks. I will accept one or the other

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
 but not both. Raj also says that there have been a friend of Glasgow since very early and got an

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,520
 email saying they were being upgraded to full attending without any extra payments so they're

42
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,720
 not sure where the £20 that I mentioned comes from. I don't think anyone else knows Glasgow £20

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,040
 I think it is just me and it's a long story involving a contraceptive and a time machine and we don't

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,720
 have time to go into it here. That was a reference. I did try and get Eastercom to owe me a penny but

45
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
 instead of going for a complicated process I just told them that their form was not quite right.

46
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,960
 That was great. Thank you for getting in touch Raj. And for continuing to listen now like the

47
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,680
 you know the buzz of listening to 90 episodes and two weeks has won off. Esther wrote to us.

48
00:04:51,680 --> 00:05:00,720
 Esther did. She wrote us a long email explaining some of the background as to why the Glasgow website

49
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,440
 was complicated saying they think they should have sorted that out by now but saying critically

50
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,280
 that Badger is the best cat. Badger is the best cat. Basically Esther sent us an email telling us

51
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,400
 to shove it up our back end. Only people who have read the email know why that's funny which means

52
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,760
 it's us three at Esther because Esther didn't at all say that but it pleases me to lie. She said

53
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,480
 you're very welcome to cut it all apart from the bit about Badger being the best cat. You have to

54
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,880
 say that on the podcast. I mean that is fine. I would say that every week if necessary.

55
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,040
 By quoting Esther out of context John why have just ensured that Esther will send us another email.

56
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,000
 I think she's good. I think she's good really it's cool.

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,400
 Bah, ha, ha, ha, ha. Yeah and it's very nice of Esther to take the time to write to us and explain

58
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,080
 things because I imagine she is basically permanently busy for the next two years.

59
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,760
 And whose fault is that? We love you Esther. We love Glasgow. It's the best WorldCom and Badger is the best cat.

60
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,920
 Glasgow is the best WorldCom. Badger is the best cat. Karen Schafer is the only person to respond to

61
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,320
 my exaltation to the listeners to email if you vote for best editor and she emailed to say

62
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,680
 that she doesn't. So as far as I could tell literally none of our listenership does

63
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
 which I think says a lot about the viability of the category in general. Fair. Sorry editors

64
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,000
 but it's not editors obviously do a great job and deserve recognition. The hue goes to a terrible

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,800
 job of providing a mechanism by which that can happen I think is where I'm at on this.

66
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 Karen does suggest best editor awards we better given as a nebula judged by a professional audience

67
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
 which yeah I mean is it going to work in the hue goes because that's not how the hugh goes

68
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,320
 work but I think there is maybe some truth to that or you know kind of like how the the Oscars

69
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,280
 work of having like specialist vote on particular specialist categories or at least created shortlist

70
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,520
 in particular categories you know that might be interesting to have like an editor voted shortlist

71
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,160
 of editors for a public vote or something similar. I know this will never happen in the hugh goes

72
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,640
 but it's fun to speculate. I'm looking forward to the Batties which is Liz's awards

73
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,160
 recognising editors. The Batties. I'm not giving out any awards recognising editors

74
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,360
 okay any awards but if I did they'd look. What would you give awards for if you were giving

75
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,800
 awards Liz? I don't know don't put me on the spot. Best award trophy. You were going to talk about

76
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,920
 my plumbers there Alison. I was Mark Plutmer wrote to correct John's statement about

77
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,400
 ISBNs and ISSN's he says he didn't say anything about that in terms of fanzine and

78
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,800
 British library deposits because banana wings doesn't have one and they were contacted by the

79
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,400
 British library and told they had to deposit copies so I'm like well what did plocked it I mean

80
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
 presumably at some point the British library decided that banana wings was worthwhile and

81
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,200
 plocked it was trivial. I mean it's good to know that the British library has an accurate

82
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,400
 impression of the British landscape isn't it? Yeah you only need to deposit copies if there's

83
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,080
 a print edition apparently and there were there were online editions of octa-thop so maybe they

84
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,560
 just kind of went over the way back machine will do. Did you mean to talk there or or plocked

85
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,960
 I probably meant plocked to what did I say did it make any sense does anything make any sense?

86
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,240
 You know because you said there are print editions of octa-thop and like we haven't been

87
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,040
 talking about putting octa-thop in the British library because that would be weird.

88
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,920
 Hey British library would you like octa-thop? To be fair Liz I assumed you knew that every

89
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,080
 episode I make I put on a USB stick and mail it straight to the British library I don't know what

90
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,120
 they do with them. Well they farted to their big round reading bin so they said they just mail

91
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:47,200
 it straight back. Mark said as our resident fan historian Alison, undoubtedly already know I

92
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,480
 did not know this obviously because I am not a fan historian. The new wusswuss memberships are a

93
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,800
 reversion to the way that things used to be done. You pay to join the convention and then you paid

94
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,640
 an attending supplement if you were planning to go. C1956 where it says of loncon to join the

95
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,240
 convention it will cost fans one dollar then it will cost them another dollar if they attend.

96
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
 How was the first loncon Alison? Fuck off John.

97
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,520
 Thank you very much to Mark for writing in. We also heard from Nicholas White on the subject

98
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,920
 of Hugo nominations which basically he says Alison is right that works don't include people.

99
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,320
 The logic he gives is that people can be eligible in both categories and so moving the wouldn't make

100
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,720
 sense. I do kind of feel like if someone's clearly not eligible in one category and is clearly

101
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,320
 eligible in the other it would absolutely make sense again. So I still think that's a whole but

102
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,960
 but no fair enough. He's good to know that that is how it works.

103
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,960
 What if you move some one what if you move nominations to someone who was

104
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,600
 definitely not eligible in both but you didn't move nominations for someone who say

105
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,160
 you know edited lots and lots of novels and a small amount of short fiction therefore would

106
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,480
 be like technically eligible in both but much more likely to be nominated in one it gets tricky.

107
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,040
 Now as a good point it is a good point. Chris Zephyr J Garcia he says that he sent

108
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,120
 issues of the journey planet to the British Library and also to the Library of Congress the

109
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,800
 National Library of Ireland the National Library of Australia and a few universities and other

110
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,120
 libraries and apparently the University of California Riverside had asked Chris to send a USB stick of

111
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,480
 everything he's ever done to them but he hasn't done yet. UC Riverside have a then they have a huge SF

112
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,000
 library or SF collection. Sorry I was just contemplating a USB stick containing everything

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,160
 Chris Garcia has ever done. It doesn't include the poos. How many terabytes would you need for the

114
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,520
 completed works of Chris Garcia? Chris writing and let us know. Yeah we expect you to have done this

115
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,840
 by the next time we record and we expect to know exactly how many bites it is to the bite

116
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:01,360
 no rounding. He also says about episode 69 in his letter regarding that he has lots of opinions

117
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,480
 about he goes he thinks there should be as many he goes as Oscars. I don't know how many Oscars

118
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,160
 there are he also says despite the complete opaqueness of EPH he thinks it's worked and is working

119
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,160
 and yeah I agree with that I think anyone else got any opinions? Don't the Oscars have so many

120
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,480
 Oscars that they basically present a load of them I think will be less popular to television

121
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,360
 audience after a separate ceremony. Yeah so so that's the problem is that if we have very many

122
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,320
 more Hugo's some of them get passed out to a different ceremony and guess who gets put into

123
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,280
 the different ceremony? Best editor. It should be a continually moving feast based on how many votes

124
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:49,440
 they got the previous year. Oh oh oh this I would be very up for the Hugo's being a lot more like the

125
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:59,200
 Premier League. They could be a playoff. Fiona Moore wrote to us on episode 67 saying that they've

126
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,400
 now shut the boat ride at Phantom Peak presumably because of the number of people who got duckings

127
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:11,680
 as the weather got colder. We got very wet on that ride. It turns out that you know how boats have

128
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,640
 like sides so that if the boat rocks a bit water doesn't come in. Turns out that was a good innovation.

129
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,360
 I thought all boats just were infinite planes. Do you know that boats have sides?

130
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,160
 Yeah this boat was a not very infinite plane with with... Do they have corners or do they have

131
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,080
 vertices? That's the question. Octoport vertex corner. That's one for anyone who has listened

132
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:46,080
 from the very early days. Should that be Octoport corner vertex? Ah we also had Peter Soderman

133
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,400
 wrote in to say that he is listening on Bluetooth enabled hearing aids so he can hear us right in

134
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:59,680
 his ears and Farah Mendelssohn responded to say that Farah also does this. So um hoorah for hearing

135
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,520
 aids. I'm very flattered that you choose to basically keep pipers directly into brains. Yep.

136
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,120
 What's the news peeps? There isn't really that much news. Yeah! And that was the Octoport

137
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,440
 Despite it being a while since we recorded it seemed to have been a unusually quiet season for

138
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,320
 science fiction science fiction fandom news. I'm saying that because then I know everyone's

139
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,800
 going to write into us tell us which bits of news we missed. What we should do is we should do you

140
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,960
 know when there's not much news on the actual news and they do loads of like human interest stories

141
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,240
 we could just spend ages talking about Johnny and his new cat. I feel that is more of a visual

142
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,720
 story. Very good cat though. It's a good cat. Anyway news there was I mean there was some news.

143
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,280
 After we said the most exciting thing on the off-sea clock award shortlist was Deep Wheel

144
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,400
 Ocadia by Harry Josephine Giles it duly won the off-sea clock awards so congratulations. Yes. Yes.

145
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,760
 And you it turns out you can get it as an audio book narrated by the author so that's probably what

146
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,560
 I will do. Oh yes I know the none of us were at the clock award ceremony but I saw photos it

147
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,200
 looks like this year I was at the science museum tying in with an exhibit at the science museum

148
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,680
 that looks pretty good. A bunch of us are going to the science fiction exhibition at the science

149
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,160
 museum on the morning of the 25th of November so do come along if you'd like to just book your

150
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,520
 ticket for 11 o'clock and I will see you there. It was curated by Glenn Morgan who has written

151
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,280
 a accompanying book or edited in a accompanying book which Rachel Livermore has a chapter in

152
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,480
 wow so that was very good and I'm excited to have a look at it but I'm also excited to go to the

153
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,240
 exhibition. So I am pretty excited. Are you going to the exhibition as well John? I mean at some point

154
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,000
 I haven't made much firm plans. Yes. Running till next year. So well done to Harry Josephine

155
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,800
 Drowls. I still haven't read any of the other C o'clock award nominees but I will get around to

156
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,400
 it eventually probably. And there were a couple of shortlist reviews I think this one on Strain

157
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,360
 Tries and Switch I will pop in the comments. Show notes not the comments. Pop in the show notes.

158
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,200
 Don't forget to like and subscribe listeners.

159
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,480
 Alison tell us about Pemicon and the emails you have received from them. I am I suppose I'm a

160
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,760
 supporting member of Pemicon and they've sent me an email saying you're a supporting member of Pemicon

161
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,720
 and here's what you need to do to upgrade to attend and I'm a supporting member of Pemicon because I

162
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,920
 accidentally got pissed and spent 60 dollars on a moustache shirt at their party at Chicold which

163
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,680
 is why you should never go to parties at Wilcons. The moral of the story is don't party listeners.

164
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:01,520
 And I was pissed because I had been drinking pints and pints of James Bacon's toilet water

165
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,240
 and I don't know how much alcohol is in it. Dave O'Neill's toilet water. It was David

166
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,400
 Doney's toilet pims earlier in the weekend and then later in the weekend it was toilet water

167
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,520
 said James and Dave O'Neill was like oh god he's put passion for, I step aside for one

168
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:25,360
 million and he's put passion fruit in it. And it was repulsive but alcoholic like so many people I know.

169
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,040
 But the excellent thing about this is that Alison gets regular emails from Pemicon now

170
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,520
 reminding her that she got too drunk and bought a moustache shirt which is amazing.

171
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,280
 And that if I would like I could buy another moustache shirt because they have more moustache

172
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,000
 shirts for the con. Yes they immediately changed the moustache shirt when they became Pemicon.

173
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,160
 Yeah so I bought the moustache shirt and then eight hours later it was it was out of date when

174
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,120
 they announced the the convention. Well and given that you're doing Glasgow merch I hope you're

175
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,600
 taking copious notes because this is merchandise par excellence. Pretty much yeah. But I have

176
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,760
 got a nice moustache shirt. I mean have you bought another moustache shirt now then? Not yet.

177
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:11,920
 Boo. Oh god how drunk was I? You were quite drunk. I don't know I think I'd gone to bed

178
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,880
 at the point you purchased this t-shirt this is the problem right?

179
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,520
 It seems very likely duffled to it. Yes. Was that the night when you stayed up and drank margaritas?

180
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:30,560
 No different night. Okay oh. No oh no I got very drunk on several lights at Chicago. Sorry guys.

181
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,960
 And I stopped using John's excellent app called moderation that tells you how much you've had

182
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,480
 to drink and goes nah-ah-ah later in the evening. Have pancakes that have jam on them made by

183
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,480
 listener to the podcast Meg. Ooh very good. Anyway do you want to talk about the First Nations fund

184
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,160
 which is why we were bringing up Pemicon. So Pemicon have announced their First Nations travel fund

185
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,280
 and they have said that they are committed to reserving 10% of their adult attending

186
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,320
 memberships or 4000 Canadian dollars which if it is greater to assist Indigenous

187
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,320
 science fiction and fantasy fans to travel to Winnipeg this fund will be under the direction of

188
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,640
 Indigenous groups who will contact Pemicon to request funds for individuals they believe

189
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,200
 should be assisted to travel. Pemicon will not make decisions about who is eligible for funding

190
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,680
 and they haven't I don't think they've released more information than that there is a link in the

191
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,360
 show notes that's quite neat I like it. I think it's very neat and Alison you could now think of it as

192
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,320
 buying a quite nice t-shirt and also making a large donation to the First Nations fund

193
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,960
 if that helps with your t-shirt buying. I could write to them and say could you not give me a

194
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,760
 supporting membership and instead donate the purchase price of that t-shirt to the First Nations

195
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,880
 fund rather than using it for the general convention fund which is presumably what I actually supported.

196
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,560
 Yeah but they're not going to you know the more money they get the more they'll have for that

197
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,880
 and it's not like you as a sporting member you're going to cost them much money anyway were you?

198
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,840
 No don't suppose so I'm an idiot and you might want your sporting membership anyway if you fancy

199
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:15,360
 voting on the NASFIC. Ooh the NASFIC for 24 presumably. Class go. 24 NASFIC which I probably do care

200
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,080
 about don't I. Do you? I don't know. I don't feel I should care about but nevertheless. I'm

201
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,440
 probably not going. Yeah I mean unless it's in Glasgow but it seems unlikely. Because it was

202
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,880
 very convenient if we organised the NASFIC in Glasgow for the week before the world caught it

203
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,240
 would be just great because everyone could just do both conventions. I feel this is constitutionally

204
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,640
 not allowed. I believe no matter how you read the section of the Wissers Constitution on the

205
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:49,120
 definition of North America it is difficult to put Scotland in it. Yeah okay we will hold it in the

206
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,160
 Canadian Embassy in Edinburgh. Canadian Embassy please write in. Also I don't think surely it would

207
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,920
 be a consulate. Yeah it's a Canadian Embassy in Edinburgh. Well because there's only one embassy

208
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:09,600
 right and presumably it is in London. I'm presuming. It was just a joke. I mean I understand that it

209
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,160
 needed to be micro-analyzed. Look right. If your jokes are not factually accurate jokes about

210
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,600
 Canadian international relations are they really jokes?

211
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:31,600
 We were then going to talk about Chengdu. Liz do you want to get started on Chengdu?

212
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,040
 Yes so the reason I was going to bring up Chengdu is because I think I went to their website to see

213
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,120
 if there was any news about Chengdu and realised that I could now log in to their website. So I

214
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:51,600
 log in and I have an account on their website and it shows me I have a Wissers membership, a 2023

215
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,760
 Hugo Award voting rights membership, physical admission, online admission and voting rights for 2025.

216
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:05,840
 I'm not quite sure why they are listed as five different categories but I have caught all the

217
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,920
 Chengdu Pokemon. So I assume anyone else who voted at discount can now log in and do the same and

218
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,760
 check everything is fine in their account. What I can't work out is if it's actually possible to

219
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,160
 buy a new admission. I mean at the risk of your form when you can try and do it but they don't

220
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,000
 have credit card payments up and running yet. Can you pay by WeChat? Yeah so you can pay by

221
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:40,480
 WeChat and AliPay I think and there is a thing saying that you can pay by transferring fees

222
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,640
 directly to our collaborator but I haven't gone through the whole form to figure out if that actually

223
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,080
 works because they have to fill in a whole form and they don't actually want to buy

224
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,440
 another membership. Because we're already attending. Yeah I mean I think you know they made

225
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,640
 you stand up with a US agent and that would be perfectly sensible and I could three actively

226
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,720
 pay by WeChat but I don't think I've set up a credit card with WeChat so but that's on me you

227
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,760
 know. I haven't spent a while this week having to get my line account re-verified so that I could

228
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,720
 pay because it's a mechanism I use to pay train fares basically. You can set up everything in line

229
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,000
 but it won't properly validate your payments stuff until you fully do the know your customer

230
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,480
 thing which in my case required me to send them two separate forms of ID like as selfie is next to

231
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:32,000
 my face so I suspect you're going to have a lot of problems. What is line? So line is it's a Japanese

232
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,840
 social messaging and everything app you know in the way you have now everything apps it's a Japanese

233
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,640
 one but it's very very widely used in Thailand so I can link it up to the where I pay my like

234
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,160
 train fares using a card on the train system in Bangkok and use it so I can recharge my train

235
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,400
 card through that and it's not working because I hadn't apparently fully verified my identity

236
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,320
 and so I have now done that but it took a while but until you actually try and pay for something

237
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,280
 you wouldn't know you weren't properly verified so I suspect WeChat is going to be the same but you

238
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,000
 can give it a go. I had to do quite a bit of verification to get the chat the account in the

239
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 first place but maybe not enough. When I try and click on the login link I've been sent I get

240
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,280
 Chinese characters that say incorrect password but I'm not using a password so I am confused by that.

241
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,320
 Did you request a login thing and it gives you... Oh no no it worked it worked if I pressed the

242
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,040
 link in the second email that just arrived I don't want to tell them why there are two but I'm in.

243
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,680
 Ah yeah that sort of thing where if you've got this is the thing I'm finding with like login

244
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,120
 emails because I was working with a very rubbish email login system for something if you I

245
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,000
 accidentally request two the first one gets automatically cancelled but the second one hasn't arrived

246
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,120
 so anyway you're in. Yeah I had to translate this from Chinese listeners. Thank you for

247
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,680
 participating in site selection vote of the 2023 World Science Fiction Congress. You have obtained

248
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,600
 membership in Chengdu 2023 World Science Fiction Congress and enjoy the corresponding online and

249
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,560
 offline participation rights and I've got Wussfuss membership, physical admission, online admission

250
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:11,280
 and about credit card payment. No hang on what this will let me buy how do I get to the one I've

251
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,840
 actually got. Hmm purchase history? No look at World Con rights the thing saying World Con rights

252
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:25,040
 tied to this email. Oh yes yes I see it yep I have the same ones that Liz has. Yeah cool cool yes

253
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:31,200
 so I just need to go and do this process but it's probably not that exciting to do it live on the

254
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,400
 podcast. You do have to click the big button that says register and then log into their payment page

255
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,400
 to get there because you're basically logging into the account you have in their payment portal

256
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,120
 which has their product associated with it so it's a little bit counterintuitive but it does

257
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,360
 appear to be there and they said on their main website they'd send an email to people who voted

258
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,080
 so if you haven't had the email yet presumably there will be one. I have the right to bid in

259
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:05,280
 site selection in 2023 for the 2025 World Con and at the moment there is only one on the docket which

260
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:12,240
 is Seattle so I will be going and pretending to be the Starbucks logo in front of the first Starbucks.

261
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,240
 If before we go off the subject of Chandhu though we have to say guest of honor choice still shit.

262
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,280
 Yeah yes I mean I'd say problematic but we're beyond problematic aren't we really.

263
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,440
 We are we'll be on problematic here this isn't really a this is a mess.

264
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,560
 Yeah and Chandhu as far as I can tell just completely silent.

265
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:40,800
 Yeah. On most things since since Chai Khan really. When it reflects poorly on Chengdu

266
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:47,280
 and it reflects poorly on maybe this is unfair but I think if I was a guest of honor on that ballot

267
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,320
 I would be saying to Chengdu one of us goes and if it's not them it's me.

268
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,280
 I'm so I'm a little bit surprised Robert J. Sawyer is still a Chengdu guest of honor if I'm honest.

269
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,360
 It's quite a battle of this yes.

270
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,280
 So so yeah I it's just horrible.

271
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,920
 I do want to say we don't actually know to be fair we don't actually know whether the other guests

272
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,040
 are trying to put pressure on behind the scenes which they may feel is and you know it may

273
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,280
 be more effective putting pressure on them while still guests of honor just declaring they won't be a

274
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,120
 guest of honor but there probably is a point that we are approaching.

275
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,440
 That is a wise and fair commentless.

276
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,280
 Can I do a little plug for Glasgow?

277
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,080
 Yeah go on.

278
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,560
 One of the things that this underlines for me is the importance of engaging with the community

279
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,320
 issue as you build your convention and the Glasgow's got a community group on Facebook already

280
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,640
 up and running. It has 800 members it has people posting about all sorts of things

281
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,080
 that they're two years out they're already getting going with this and I think that's very

282
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,120
 commendable.

283
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:55,600
 No I mean Glasgow are doing a phenomenal job of talking to and involving the community

284
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:03,120
 which is largely thanks to the work of the two promotions DH's who are Matt Calvert and

285
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,360
 the amazing Meg MacDonald.

286
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:15,280
 World fantasy con are going to be in Birmingham maybe.

287
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,320
 I don't know I mean I can't tell I kind of looked on the internet to see at what point the

288
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,920
 result is announced but I assume it's basically after they all get up later today and that's why

289
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,640
 why we don't know yet but Farrah Mendelssohn and Karen Fishick are in New Orleans at the moment

290
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,040
 enjoying New Orleans and also the World Fantasy Convention also bidding to bring it to the Birmingham

291
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:48,160
 hit show. Wait it's Farrah bidding I think so I'm not at all sure Farrah is involved oh

292
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:54,480
 because all I can see is it's kind of wish we can HWS events so picture of them yes doesn't say

293
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,520
 that Farrah is bidding for UFC just says that Farrah is there next to the person bidding.

294
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,880
 Ah yes and says so stop us and ask about it but doesn't explicitly say Farrah are you involved

295
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,160
 in this bit and if you are Harrah and if not also Harrah you do you will we go to World

296
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,880
 Fantasy in Birmingham have you ever been to a World Fantasy con before either of you I've never been.

297
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,920
 Yeah I went to the one in Brighton I enjoyed my weekend in Brighton I had a nice enough time

298
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,040
 but it is very much aimed at professionals and the vibe I got was very much this is a con for

299
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,800
 professionals and anyone else who comes along that's nice but we're not really into you I also took

300
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,600
 a day out in the middle to go to a wedding so I maybe did not do the full con experience.

301
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,880
 I might go to World Fantasy Convention in Birmingham if enough of my pals are going which they might

302
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:58,640
 be but I feel like it's not really a convention for me and my main interests. Yeah that's pretty much

303
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,080
 it I went because it was in the UK it's very rarely in the UK I thought it would be fun to go

304
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,560
 along and see and I found I got a very cheap early membership and a very cheap hotel room near

305
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,560
 Boi in the hotel but the convention explicitly said probably shouldn't stay here because it's

306
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:20,000
 really noisy and it was it was a travel lodge and so I had a perfectly nice time but I wouldn't say

307
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,280
 it was such a great convention experience that I feel compelled to go back and it was also the one

308
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,800
 where basically didn't really have a code of conduct and their like access was awful the

309
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,920
 registration was in I think a room which you could only access via stairs and that kind of thing

310
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,000
 so I liked it but nothing about it made me think yes I definitely want to go back but I think this

311
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,080
 one is a it looks like a sort of completely different team who've been running UK fantasy

312
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,120
 cons and so yeah running a World Fantasy cons sounds like a perfectly sensible step and I'm

313
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,360
 sure it'd be very nice but it's probably not something that's going to like draw me back to the UK to

314
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,320
 go to if I'm not here. To be fair for you the maths the maths on this works quite a lot differently to

315
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,840
 us right because Toyland is a lot further from Birmingham yeah although 2025 is a long way away

316
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:15,120
 The next thing on the show notes is Novocon excitement question mark

317
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,560
 What I like about this is that Alison is the one keeping us on topic

318
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,360
 Who wrote Novocon excitement question mark on the show note? Me because I didn't know if

319
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,800
 anyone was excited is anyone excited? I have I mean I'm obviously excited for Novocon because

320
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,160
 by then I will be back using a an app that tells me not to drink too much and so therefore I will

321
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,480
 drink moderately throughout good how sensible hmm sance plausible doesn't it I am looking for

322
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,800
 to Novocon which is um next weekend it's next weekend oh okay by the time this episode drops I

323
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:57,200
 believe the fishlifters will already be in Buxton yeah we're not going up till the Friday but

324
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,800
 we've kind of dithered back and forwards on whether we were going to go buy train our car but I think

325
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,640
 we're actually going to go buy car because I think we're worried about train strikes and the fish

326
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,720
lifters are solving this by going the day early I believe the train strikes have been called off

327
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,120
 but equally I believe Buxton is a pain in the arse to get to by train anyway um yeah but I much

328
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,240
 prefer train to it's not really for conventions for me it's not so much the pain of getting there

329
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,840
 it's how much stuff you have to take and then also how much you're going to need a car once

330
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,440
 you're there and the answer in Buxton is not at all because that hotel is right by the station and

331
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,240
 also right by everywhere else in a way that I really like so I am very much looking forward to

332
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,640
 going back to Novocon and having fun and I think I'm trading there you've got a week to sort that

333
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,360
 one out yeah I've got about four days I'm a bit worried that by taking holiday this week I've had

334
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,880
 a lovely relaxing holiday by essentially putting all the things I had to do before Novocon out of my

335
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,320
 mind completely for four five days and I'm not sure that was very healthy but you know it's been

336
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,640
 it's been great I had a lovely time what I like about this is that by asking this innocent question

337
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,800
 in the show notes I basically caused Alison existential dread so sorry Alison I've made a

338
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,640
 note of it for talking to my therapist anyone else on anyone else excited about Novocon writing

339
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,200
 people I am not going to Novocon I don't think Liz is going to Novocon either I am not but hello to

340
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,480
 all our listeners who are listening doctor on their way to Novocon you can now I'm the very

341
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,880
 quickly writer letter about how excited you are or tell us how it was yes indeed I did realize

342
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:41,280
 what I was going to say about Novocon which is that um hello my column is doing the program and

343
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,560
 wrote to me and said would you like to be on this item that looks pretty interesting and I was very

344
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:52,160
 excited because nobody ever asked me to be on the program at Novocon so so that was thrilling and

345
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,160
 it was a great show that I had to write back and say no because it's at 10 o'clock on Sunday morning

346
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,920
 and I have booked a hangover for 10 o'clock on Sunday morning so I won't be at this item hang on

347
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,920
 he said no one ever invites you to be on program at Novocon didn't you do recording of this very

348
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,280
 podcast at Novocon last year. If I were to know that I wouldn't say we were invited I would say we

349
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:18,400
 we we we forced our way into a room with an iPad and and made Esther buy us drinks we're awful

350
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,360
 thank you Esther yeah any listener who likes to buy me a drink at Novocon is is very welcome

351
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:30,000
 because I still have no money um yeah I'm a bit sad I'm not going but equally yep I'm sure everyone

352
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,520
 who does go will have a great time and yeah please write in and tell us how good a time you had

353
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,280
 it's nice to see Novocon is still going because I was worried they would sort of

354
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,600
 get 50 and stop but they have not so it's nice that even though I very rarely actually get to go

355
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,360
 that it does give everyone the opportunity to go and have a nice time hanging out in Buxton

356
00:33:47,360 --> 00:34:00,080
 actually but my this episode is all pre-show and no content I feel like we've gone through a

357
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,880
 lot of important Spanish topics of the day and now we're going to do pics pics we've been so

358
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,600
 on topic that to reward ourselves we're going to do pics so my pick is I have gone slightly retro

359
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,640
 because at some point in the past when it was uh on sale I bought the complete books of Earthsea

360
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,480
 and then decided it was time for a reread and in fact to get through I've got through

361
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,080
 the first four and I don't think I ever actually read Tohani before and it's

362
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,600
 it's really interesting rereading them they hold it very well but if you read them all in a row

363
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,960
 you can also see kind of the development going through the characters especially in

364
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,600
 Tohani being written much later on and as Le Guin mentions in the the forward to it

365
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,560
 kind of a book she couldn't write until she was much further on in her personal development

366
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,280
 tackling the kind of feminist issues that are in that one because there when you read it it just

367
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,560
 put into context how sparse the female characters are in the first few books and how much

368
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,000
 was missing from like the the point of view of any of the women in this world and then it's kind

369
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,080
 of all there in the the fourth book I mean it's there in second book to some extent but around

370
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,320
 magic and so on and the division between wizards and witches is all very interestingly explored

371
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:22,800
 anyway they yeah hold up really nicely therefore short fun reads in a really nice world and I

372
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,360
 enjoyed visiting it and I've got the the books of earthsea the the collected short fiction to go nice

373
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:35,200
 I need to read earthsea I've got the first book on my iPad but I haven't it hasn't bubbled to the

374
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,520
 top of my to read list yet but I know that there's a deficiency in my education that I need to address

375
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,080
 yeah I mean there's obviously like there's always lots of discussion around like oh and people

376
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,240
 recommend books that people should read and it's like stop recommending books from your youth

377
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,560
 because they're not always great maybe we should not be recommending people things written in the

378
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,480
 60s and 70s but actually I do think these hold up I'm not sure that you know the first things I

379
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,960
 would recommend to someone yeah but I think they really they will reward you reading them no and I

380
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,680
 think that's the thing right you've got a you've got a temper recommendations of you don't want to

381
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,880
 recommend people not read any science fiction from the old days it's just about whether or not

382
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,800
 it's about having a balance I think between the old and the new at earthsea is one of the ones I do

383
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,720
 want to read from the old yeah and it's also considering that stuff you actually read

384
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,560
 20 30 years ago may read very differently now but having you know read them at I mean I think I

385
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,040
 read the first one probably 10 or 15 years ago and as I said I only got the last ones recently

386
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,800
 you know there's something where I feel confident recommending them not something where it's like

387
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,080
 oh well I read those 20 years ago but I bet they're still great and then if I went back and reread

388
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:51,280
 them maybe they would not be from earthsea to the Northsea yes okay and it's a main

389
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,760
 me go first just for that joke I did it's not that much of a joke I went up to Newcastle last

390
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,960
 weekend which is where John lives so I got to see John which was nice and did you go to play with

391
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,000
 John's lightsaber I he did not let anyone else play with his lightsaber I don't think or if he did

392
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,200
 he certainly didn't let me play with his lightsaber I'm not sure I asked I would have been very worried

393
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,640
 about dropping it or something did you let anyone else play with your lightsaber job yeah but I

394
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,360
 can't remember who was it hug yeah anyway so I was actually staying with friends in quickly bay

395
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,320
 which is nearer to Newcastle and I think I'd realize that is it's on the Metro so there is a

396
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,800
 service into Newcastle every eight minutes I was very excited by that I was like where else in

397
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,040
 Britain has a metropolitan railway and a beach and there's not that many places so I'm going oh oh

398
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,040
 I need a city with a beach that would be good so if you live in a city with a beach let me know

399
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,680
 and I went swimming with Meg and we had formed this plan this is Meg McDonald excellent

400
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,680
 promotion joint division head for Glasgow and we had formed this plan it's her fault because

401
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,960
 I was like I'm not going to go swimming when I'm there because it's going to be the end of October

402
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,520
 and it will be absolutely perishing and she went I'll come swimming with you it'll be amazing and

403
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,120
 then when I got there for our pre-planned arrangement John was also there and I was thought oh John is

404
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,240
 also going to come swimming with us but in fact John was just there to point a law which he did

405
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:31,840
 moral support and we got in the sea and on a scale of one to absolutely perishing it was about a 12

406
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:37,200
 it's very very cold and then we swam and it kind of got gradually warmer that's the hypothermia

407
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,800
 set in and we were having quite a last time I wasn't feeling all that cold at all and then I

408
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,840
 looked at Meg and she looked really quite cold and I looked at John standing on the shore and he had

409
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,320
 stopped pointing and laughing and was now shivering and looking very cold and I was like oh maybe it's

410
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,160
 time to go out I was not a shivering and looking cold I was doing my duo lingo but so my pick is

411
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,000
 swimming in the sea sea swimming is very good for your mental health apparently cold water immersion

412
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,160
 and although the place that I'm staying at the moment which is the lake district is very nice it

413
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,400
 does not have sea that does have lakes but it's the weather's been a bit crap this week for

414
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,600
 for going in the going in the lakes though I will do next year that's my plan but I then all have

415
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,560
 done more wild swimming while swimming is good for you I felt marvelous ever since I went for

416
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,400
 that wild swim possibly because I've been on holiday almost all the time and all the rest of the time

417
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,560
 I've just been telling people nope can't do it going on holiday have to prioritize sorry people

418
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,600
 who I owe things to they'll happen eventually well I would like to say is the if Alison is going

419
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,960
 to extol the virtues of sea swimming then we'll have no more mocking of me being at the beach

420
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,920
 because I'm just going sea swimming for my mental health it doesn't work unless it's cold doesn't

421
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,440
 work if your water's a chopper mental health requires painless pain and suffering sorry yeah

422
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,720
 that would presumably be one of the quite nice things about Thailand does Thailand have any

423
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:10,320
 cities that also have beaches yes yeah so maybe I should just move to Thailand done do you pick

424
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:17,920
 I was torn on my pick but in the end I am going to pick moon night I would have picked moon

425
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,160
 night previously but previously I picked moon night volume oh god I don't even know

426
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,480
 a different moon night volume moon volume seven I'm picking volume nine this time which is uh

427
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,800
 jib mckay working with Alessandro capuccio and Rochelle Rosenberg and it is very good I very much

428
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:44,640
 liked how weird it is I haven't really a few like superhero stories recently I got bored with the

429
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,000
 current run of Ironman it wasn't very interesting um so I stopped reading it but moon night has

430
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,400
 kept my interest mainly because it is very very strange I just really like it and it's good

431
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,840
 it's got vampires in and also actually another marvel thing I really liked was well for my night

432
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:09,200
 which I watched on the day before Halloween and that was very good and very spooky and I very much

433
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,480
 liked that too so I'm kind of enjoying the the horror angle of marvel at the moment it makes me

434
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,040
 makes me happy either of you watched well of my night yet no it's horror right yeah and it's

435
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:29,040
 and it's television right no the movie movie movie it is a director Disney plus film right

436
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:37,360
 director Disney plus yep yeah it's like it's 65 minutes it's not a long movie done is volume nine

437
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:42,720
 of moon night like is this like super recent like you're reading actual kind of moon night comics as

438
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,720
 they are published or are you still kind of catching up on past issues well I'm reading our Marvel

439
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,160
 Unlimited so like I'm not on the bleeding edge because that you can't do on Marvel Unlimited

440
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,200
 but um but yeah no it is it launched in 2021 and it is still being published as far as I know

441
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,440
 are you saying that Marvel Unlimited is strictly limited no because it has all the Marvel on it

442
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,640
 but not up to date it's six months out of date I still think the Marvel Unlimited is a very good

443
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,880
 deal if you're going to read a lot of Marvel comics and you don't mind that they're not

444
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,120
 bang up to date I think it's great I just found I didn't read enough Marvel comics when I had it

445
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,640
 because there's too much entertainment not enough time so moon night came from I think I'm right

446
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:33,520
 and saying moon night came from the original world by night run so so they are connected characters

447
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:40,720
 it does seem like Marvel is going much more into their kind of like mystic magic no not magic like

448
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:49,440
 myth myth myth myth myth mythic in their into their mythic side with phase four and so I'm kind of

449
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,280
 excited about that I think that's going to be cool and I'm looking forward to seeing how it all

450
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,600
 pans out and for those who are very worried about such things well off by night on Disney Plus

451
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,280
 requires literally no other Marvel to understand are you going to watch either are you going to watch

452
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:10,640
 where off by night hmm sora probably not I'm just way behind a lot of stuff and it doesn't

453
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:18,080
 super duper appeal to me so I might get to eventually fair enough so fair positive endorsement I

454
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:24,080
 sound like the Mandalorian John so I a bit it's way better than I had the lorian it's only I

455
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,880
 you saying it's only 65 minutes you don't need anything else and it's quite good yeah although

456
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,760
 if you don't like horror I don't know how much you'll like it I like some horror that was the

457
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:54,000
 odd thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

458
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,320
 right let's move on this is a very boring episode so far well that and that's the after show
