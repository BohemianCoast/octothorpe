00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Anyway, this bit is all not for podcast. You should have pushed it not for podcast button.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 Oh yeah, I should have done. I forgot.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:25,440
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 73rd episode of Oxford or podcast for science fiction

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,320
 and science fiction fandom. This episode is coming to you on the 22nd of December 2022.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
 I'm John Coxon. I'm Alice Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,760
 And I hadn't quite put it together until I said those words out loud, but this is the Christmas

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,400
 episode. Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. Hey. Keep up some like dingle bells and shit.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,880
 I hope said Doctor Thought brings you everything you desire for a podcast. One of those.

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,840
 Right then we had letters of comment. So let's start with Raj writing in about episode 71.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,480
 Part of the problem we have been recording listeners, a peek behind the curtain.

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,800
 We have been recording about a week early for a few weeks now because of various scheduling

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,680
 trivialities, which two boys go into. But this does mean our locks. There's more overlap than

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,080
 normal. So Raj, thank you for reading it. Writing in about episode 71. Raj says that

14
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,160
 they were from his graphs. I have made the graphs. I put them in discord. I forgot to put them on

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,560
 the alt to the twitter, but they do exist. So that is progress in 72. I again mentioned graphs and

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,480
 again haven't done them, but this time they will be in the show notes because now they do exist.

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,640
 So that is concrete progress. He says he liked the idea of best publisher Hugo until Liz pointed

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,160
 out how limited the winners have been in the Lucas Awards. I still think it might be worth a go

19
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,520
 and says he loved Alison's episode art, which was great episode art. Thank you. Nobody else has

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,280
 mentioned it this time. Chris did love your episode art and he used it to prove that you were wrong.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:10,080
 I say prove very lightly. We'll go into that later. Oh, I have like a whole rant about how it turns

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,000
 out that if you're going to set a piece of a word with some negative space in the o's,

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,400
 then octothorpe is a much better word for it than Andor because it makes the whole thing look

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,240
 more balanced because there are three o's and although it's still got the really weird

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,720
 kerning thing going on, it's kind of because there's a tracking issue with the Andor logo.

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,320
 It's at the end of the word rather than at the beginning of the word. So it doesn't look so naff.

27
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,880
 Is the tracking issue that the Andor logo has gone into hyperspace and therefore you have to

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,040
 employ active tracking? But I have finished Andor now, but I was told I couldn't talk about it

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,520
 all this week. So I'm just going to slip bits of it in everywhere.

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,040
 I just Oh, Andor so good everyone. Go and watch it. It's really good.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,600
 Except that one of the things that's really good about it is got this fantastic 70s aesthetic

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,440
 except the logo, which has absolutely is clearly not a 70s piece of graphic design.

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,320
 It's I mean, it's very annoying. Anyway, where were we? Raj also said that he would vote for

34
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,560
 cleverly for best letter hack, but only if she starts writing poems again. We have had a lack

35
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,440
 of poems this year. We should we should get on that next year. Listeners, please write more poems.

36
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,200
 Seriously, if you get a Christmas poem to us, and that's a couple of days, we might record it

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,280
 and stick it out in the episode where otherwise going to miss. Yes. So we won't be recording a full

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,120
 episode over the Christmas period. So at the moment, our first episode in January stands

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:44,400
 empty of content. If you'd like to help rectify that, please send in your readings of a visit by

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,560
 St Octothorp and I will combine them together and you can you can hear your voice on the pod.

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,200
 Not reading of it. Your interpretation of it. Write us a verse for a visit from St Octothorp.

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,520
 Don't all make it the first verse or the last one or or it won't work. I don't know. It sounds

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,120
 like kind of intriguing Lovecraftian hellscape. Just repeated. Intriguing Lovecraftian hellscape,

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
 the podcast. I mean, your problem is that the listeners have stopped writing as poetry.

45
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,400
 And so I think no one's going to write us any poetry here. And so it will be a dud.

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:24,080
 Liz, I hereby on the podcast bet you the princely sum of one point of beer that people will write in.

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,440
 Perian Lurie wrote to us to say that the Washington Science Fiction Association,

48
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,080
 which she says do not confuse with Wussfuss, which is of course the World Science Fiction Society,

49
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,840
 or presumably Boa-wa, which is the Boston and Washington area. Baltimore. Boa-wa-wa.

50
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:50,720
 Baltimore and Washington area. Will, what do the world was, stand for?

51
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,800
 People's. Look, if you're going to make this joke, you should have done the research for your

52
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,000
 joke out of time. It is the Baltimore Washington Area World Con Association Incorporated.

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,600
 And as we all know, you pronounce it boa-wa-wa-wa. It's not that either. The Washington

54
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,160
 Science Fiction Association gives an award for Best Story published by a Small Press every year.

55
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,520
 So that's quite good. I approve. And crucially, she says that they give an award to the editor of

56
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,160
 the, sorry as well, which is why it was relevant to our discussion of editors and so on.

57
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,600
 Yes. And that is, that is a good idea. It's good to hear that that happens at other Science Fiction

58
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
 Awards. And I think there is no reason that that could not happen in the Hugo's. And actually,

59
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,640
 I'm going to go, I'm going to discuss my graphs because they've unexpectedly become relevant.

60
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,600
 So I drew some bar charts of the, of the distribution of the number of nominations in each category.

61
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,720
 And I would say they're broadly speaking three ways you can, you can kind of group these

62
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,000
 categories. So there's, there's one category which has best novel, best short story, better,

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,480
 best dramatic presentation in both forms. And those are ones where you get significantly more

64
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,960
 people nominating five than you do nominating one. And I think that basically says there's an

65
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,360
 awful lot of novels and short stories and best dramatic presentations of which people are aware.

66
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,120
 And so lots of people nominate lots of them. And that is good. And then there's ones where the number

67
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
 of people that nominate five is very close to the number of people nominating one. So that's like

68
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,440
 novella, novelette, professional artist, and semi-prozine. And those are ones where like clearly there's

69
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,760
 slightly fewer options. But if you're tuned in, then there are as many people who know one as no

70
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,160
 five. And I think that basically says that those are quite vibrant categories of quite a lot going on.

71
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,760
 I think in the case of semi-prozine, it probably means that the semi-prozine category is not adequately

72
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,520
 reflecting the breadth of the semi-prozines in the field, perhaps. And then you get categories where

73
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,040
 the number of people who know one is way higher than the number of people who know more than one.

74
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,320
 And these are all the fan categories and both of the editor categories. And also best graphics

75
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,640
 story, best series and best related work. And I'm not sure I would have grouped series graphic

76
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,960
 story and related work in this category, although having now seen the data, it makes a lot of sense.

77
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,320
 But yeah, basically, I think this is saying that people really don't know the field in terms of

78
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,680
 editor or in terms of the fan works. In the fan works, it's a bit to be expected because the

79
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,240
 fan works were obviously less high profile than the pro works and for longtime listeners. You will

80
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,280
 know that fanzine editors have not always enthusiastically embraced the Hugo's fan awards. But in terms of

81
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,320
 editor, I think this is really pointing out that these categories are not particularly healthy ones,

82
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,720
 even at the nomination stage. And I do think that is further evidence that an alternative

83
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,600
 tag would be good because editing is a hugely important part of the genre. And we should properly

84
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,080
 recognise it. And it doesn't look to me like the Hugo's do a good job of that. And this and this

85
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,120
 banks that up, I think, I think is also probably an argument against best series. But that makes me

86
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,840
 sad because I like best series. So I'm conflicted. It'll be interesting to see best game. Thank you

87
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,600
 for doing the graphs. That was cool. Yeah, no, they're good. It's it's amazing how visualising

88
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,640
 data can let you draw conclusions that just tables a day don't. He said with his I do graphs for a

89
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,960
 living how? Hooray for whoever invented the graph. Listeners, write in and tell us who invented the

90
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,080
 graph. I don't know but I do know who invented the pie chart because it's it's one of these cool

91
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,960
 things. It's Mr. Pie. I think everyone knows who invented the pie chart right or who popularised

92
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,800
 the pie chart. Mr. Pie. Florence Nightingale who used it to get money out of the government because

93
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,120
 the notion that Florence Nightingale was a nurse and not a bad ass statistical expert

94
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:54,320
 and and cast that administrator who's data a lot to affect medical improvements is is well,

95
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,160
 you know, that's one of the things nurses do. But it's not the thing that nurses are traditionally

96
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,560
 able to do. So she's a nurse of the bad ass administrator and she is a honorary fellow of the

97
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,640
 Royal Statistics Society or something like that for that purpose or past precedent or whatever

98
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,160
 it is they do. I should invent the pie chart. No, it's I'm sorry I misgendered her as Mr. Pie.

99
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,560
 My ex wrote in with some pedantry and I can't find his lock now but it was basically,

100
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,680
 oh no, you're going to have a canner's gonna have a high consulate because it's a Commonwealth

101
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,320
 country rather than a rather than a embassy and that is of course correct but dull so you know.

102
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,600
 And for those who don't know, Alison's ex is Mike Scott. Thank you very much for it again Mike.

103
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:49,120
 Christopher J Garcia wrote in basically saying locus is a hugely important part of SF and he says

104
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:56,720
 he hopes they meet their goal. And in the discussion we had last episode was that we all hope locus

105
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,200
 will be here in 10 years in a sustainable form. I think the discussion we had last episode was

106
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,080
 around whether or not we think they're going about that in a way we think we'll reach that goal.

107
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,320
 And I think we're all a little bit skeptical but if they pull it off great and we are all

108
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
 rooting for them to still be here in a decade please because they are an important part of the

109
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,720
 genre and it is nice to have some of these old institutions knocking about. But yes thank you

110
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,960
 very much for hanging Chris. Chris did also mention the Andor logo but we mentioned that earlier.

111
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,080
 But basically he says that it's very clever and so Alison is wrong.

112
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,320
 Chris also wrote at length about his low relationship with locus on locus's website which we will put

113
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,760
 in the show notes for you. Complete with a picture of Chris which I don't know how that picture of

114
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,720
 Chris's but you look very young Chris so let us know when that picture was taken. I have a picture

115
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,240
 taken of Chris roughly a decade ago where we met up for high jinks in San Francisco and he was

116
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,160
 wearing a t-shirt that said earth first will strip mine the other planets later and he looked very

117
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,480
 young in that photo. The last 10 years have distinguished him. I think maybe having children

118
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,720
 makes you age. Alison sort of grinned so I think I might be on something there but we'll see.

119
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,360
 Yeah no no I had children and I turned around and it was 20 years later and I was 51. How did that

120
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,640
 happen? He also asked a question which is query would John Paul be eligible for best John?

121
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,760
 And I've got a potentially controversial opinion here which is if John Paul had a space in it yes

122
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,400
 but it doesn't so no. Yeah because you asked last week about Jonathan's and I was like definitely

123
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,600
 not. I would I would be anti-Johnathan inclusion mostly because people insist on call it be Jonathan

124
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,000
 which is not my name. I did it once I did it once. Oh no I don't mind people doing it once it's when

125
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,600
 people do it repeatedly. I did it once and yes I'd kind of because I'd go through people like oh

126
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:00,000
 hello Liz John Marianne Steven Oh Caroline because as previously measured I've been in my 50s now

127
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,120
 it's what we do. I go upstairs and forget what I came up for. See I've been doing that since I

128
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,600
 was 18 so I'm a bit worried that when I get to my 50s I'm going to be a hot mess. Emphod is on the

129
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:18,160
 hot John. Hey we have a late entry from Phil. He says the space shuttle enterprise was a need

130
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,800
 named after Star Trek ship but it wasn't NASA's first choice it was going to be called constitution

131
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,360
 but a high profile campaign by Star Trek fans persuaded them to go with enterprise instead.

132
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,000
 Rodhamry named the Star Trek enterprise after the USS Enterprise which was the first nuclear

133
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,560
 powered aircraft carrier and Gene Rodhamry was apparently fascinated with it so thank you very

134
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,160
 much to Phil for writing in that was good context. And when you say Phil that's Phil Dyson. Phil Dyson

135
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,000
 who was named after the vacuum cleaner or the Dyson sphere one of those.

136
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,480
 Yep.

137
00:12:48,480 --> 00:13:00,160
 So we're going to segue seamlessly into talking about fan funds and we're going to do that because

138
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:08,640
 Raj mentions at the end of his lovely lock that the European fan fund has launched and we have

139
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:15,600
 not yet talked about it on the pod and also there is a TAF race so we're going to talk about those

140
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,800
 things listeners. Great congratulations to machine crack for getting together the European fan fund

141
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,880
 which he's been talking about for a little while but it's happening now and you if you're a European

142
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:37,520
 fan you can apply to the fund for a trip to next year's Eurocon which is we con.

143
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,640
 Yep it's in Sweden unlike the smothcon and we'll get to that later it's called conflict.

144
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,760
 For shadowing.

145
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,600
 Called conflict being held in up south of Sweden 8th to the 11th of June 2023.

146
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,520
 I think this is a great idea I think it will raise the profile of Eurocons I think it will

147
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,280
 improve harmony across European fans we love our European friends and our European listeners

148
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
 do we have the European listeners anyway.

149
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,800
 No yeah no I think it is good.

150
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,840
 My only thought is with it being a European fan fund I wonder if there could be some kind of

151
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,160
 potential for trying to get the fan fund winners to travel by train rather than flying

152
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,600
 because one of my sort of worries about you know one of the things about fan funds is we do

153
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,920
 essentially pay for someone to fly quite a long distance and I wonder if we could say well if

154
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,560
 you're taking you know a longest European fanist trip maybe you could be encouraged to do it overland

155
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,520
 might be nice.

156
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:37,680
 Beginning this is being put together on a bit of a shoestring so it's not paying for an extended

157
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,800
 trip in the way that the other fan funds do and it may be that going by train is outside

158
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,920
 the funds budget but I think that's something definitely something they should think about

159
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,560
 working towards because if they were doing a more extended trip doing that more extended trip by

160
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
 train would be awesome.

161
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,760
 Yeah I mean definitely like once the fund is more well established I think this is something

162
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,080
 that could be really good because you could buy like an inter-rail pass or something and like

163
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,160
 there are options there which are quite cool.

164
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,880
 I will say that if you are a Brit and you run for this and you win I believe it will take you

165
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,760
 roughly one day to get from London to upsella by train so I won't judge you harshly if you choose

166
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,280
 to avoid that.

167
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,280
 I think it probably works a lot better when the eurocon is like in Brussels than it does when

168
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,920
 it's in upsella which is I mean you go to Copenhagen and then you go to Stockholm and then you keep

169
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,520
 going it's a long way.

170
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,560
 I know it's a long way because I have friends who work there because it's good to study the

171
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,880
 Aurora there and now I'm wondering whether I can go to the eurocon and stay with my friend Dave so

172
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,200
 intriguing.

173
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:53,360
 This is a great idea this is something that the Canadians and the Antipardians already have.

174
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,960
 There is for fans which is the Australian New Zealand Fund Fund which sends people

175
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,480
 from Australia and New Zealand to Australia and New Zealand and then there is the Canadian

176
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,840
 Unity Fund Fund which sends people to Canadian conventions.

177
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,960
 These are very good things.

178
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:13,680
 I don't think there's a US one please write in if I am wrong listeners and it is high time there

179
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,200
 was a European one.

180
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,440
 I'm very glad to see this has happened.

181
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,680
 An important thing is that there is a long held wisdom that you don't run for one of the big three

182
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,720
 if you've already won one of the big three so you don't run for Duff or Taff if you've already won

183
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,120
 them but the smaller ones don't follow that rule so there's no reason that like old Taff winners

184
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,960
 and Duff winners can get involved.

185
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:44,160
 So like Christina Lake for instance might be a really good EFF candidate or other people of that

186
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,120
 ilk.

187
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,920
 Probably not if you're the current guff.

188
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,880
 A trip by train can start with seven hours from Cornwall to London.

189
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,400
 Well I was thinking when John said it would take you a day to get a top sauna I'm like well how long

190
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,480
 about it is just getting to the edge of the UK probably like 80%.

191
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,840
 Oh no I was doing it from London from Newcastle it's a day in seven hours

192
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,920
 and it's the seven hours which is going down to London.

193
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,880
 Or you could just take an overnight ferry somewhere which is awesome.

194
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,160
 Yes no that is true.

195
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,800
 I mean yeah because I could take the ferry from Shields to Amsterdam and then presumably I could

196
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,880
 take the train from Amsterdam but you've still got to go you've still got to go kind of up

197
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,560
 Denmark and then across the Peninsula and then up Sweden.

198
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:31,440
 I think you can take an overnight ferry to Norway and then another ferry from Norway to Sweden.

199
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,200
 Oh maybe. I mean you may not be able to now because overnight ferries were better in the past.

200
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,800
 As with so many things.

201
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,400
 Pretty sure you can I mean you can go to Amsterdam but I'm not sure you can go anywhere other than

202
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,040
 Amsterdam from Newcastle.

203
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,600
 I had another thing to ask about the European Fan Fund.

204
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,560
 I had two things.

205
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,880
 One is that presumably this is not directional any European fan can apply to go to any

206
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
 you know Eurocon.

207
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Yeah I don't think there's any eligibility around you need to be a certain distance away

208
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
 from the Eurocon but I think you know if you're a Swedish fan applying to go to

209
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,040
 conflict then you probably feel that that might be a little bit rum.

210
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,360
 Yeah but we probably do have to it'll be interesting to see how it goes like in the first few years

211
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,880
 because depending on how well it gets promoted in different regions you could end up like is there

212
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,520
 a regionality voting thing like there is for Tath like you know how on Tath you have to win

213
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,000
 kind of you know both sides or you know get a certain number of votes on both sides just because

214
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,240
 there is a potential of this be dominated by countries with more fans right so you always end

215
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,800
 up with say UK fan traveling to a convention so it'll be interesting to see like how it works

216
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,720
 with that voting and whether we do get kind of fans more of a Europe going to other places all

217
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,960
 over Europe whether it sort of ends up being a I don't know that's kind of definitely how it will

218
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,560
 be but I will be interested to see how it gets promoted.

219
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,400
 So the rules are on Marching's website and they were posted in 2019 so we have had time there has

220
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,600
 been a consultation phase the plans have been on display in our local Marching's website for

221
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,800
 three years and it's far too late so I'm making a fuss about it now but I have the rules so you

222
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,680
 have to live in a European country you have to be going to Europe on which is in a country other

223
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,760
 than your country you have to be active in fandom for at least two years which I think is more

224
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,680
 stringent than Tath I don't think Tath has any rule about that. The previous two races have to

225
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,800
 have been won by candidates from different countries from the one that you are in if there will be

226
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,480
 no other candidates this rule may be omitted they will find three nominators and at least one

227
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,440
 has to be from their country and at least one has to be from a different country that answers

228
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,720
 some of our questions. Boccin you're great you're a brick well done. Yes turns out if I had just

229
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,600
 read the rules all this would have been explained but instead I just pontificate about it isn't that

230
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,320
 always the way. Quite a lot of time yeah. So the nominations are open until the end of January and

231
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,640
 voting stops just after Eastercon as is right and proper so yes if you are interested in running

232
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,160
 then go for it I think I will be brilliant. Liz you're gonna go move back to Europe and then go to

233
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,720
 a European? It would be quite a lot of effort to go in order to get a trip to a European I feel.

234
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,440
 Fair enough. Might not be able to live in a European country again. That is fair. Well it was actually

235
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,120
 I had one extra thing which is is this gonna like when we have fanfon options is now the European

236
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,160
 fanfon going to be one of the things which gets money from the fanfon options? I would hope so.

237
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:31,760
 100% I think it is a fantastic idea and maybe this is pro-kill building the community of European

238
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:39,120
 fans is probably I think there is a much stronger community of English speaking fans across the

239
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,520
 Atlantic and across the Pacific than there is links between different European frontoms and so

240
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,440
 this is actually the one of the fanfons I think is going to be doing the best work for the next

241
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,360
 few years because I love Taff and I love Guff and I love Duff. I think in terms of cultural exchange

242
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,280
 the culture is relatively accessible in those races whereas in this one I think going to like a

243
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,120
 Swedish convention would feel much scarier to me. I mean I guess it's not surprising that you're

244
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,240
 less likely to go to conventions in countries that don't speak English if you speak English. I think

245
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,280
 that's probably entirely understandable impulse but I do think more things to encourage that kind

246
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,960
 of cross-linking might be good. Many European conventions have an English track. We should we

247
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,440
 should do more to publicize it conventions in Europe which we can do as a as a leading community

248
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:37,120
 podcast European Community podcast. Yes Europeans right in. Taff can we say such a bit Taff? Yes Taff

249
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,880
 Alison has been machinating behind the scenes again and her machinations have borne fruit!

250
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:51,200
 I haven't really at Novicon Sandra Bond said she was thinking of running and I said yes do it.

251
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,000
 That's it really and then and then Sandra Bond is running for Taff and I am one of the

252
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,480
 nominators and we have two candidates and the other is Miklai Koveleski who ran last time but

253
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,440
 was beaten by fear along with lots of other people and so it's a great race both these are good

254
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,480
 candidates and I am one of Sandra's nominators so I'm going to tell you that she's a fantastic

255
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:22,000
 Taff candidate and you should vote for her. She's incredibly interesting and funny and she has done

256
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,560
 a whole lot for Fandam and she's also a very good author and poet and if you're listening to this

257
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:36,640
 Sandra please feel free to write it with a Christmas poem for Octa Thorpe. No two good candidates

258
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,440
 one good race coming right up I'll put a link in the show notes. I have something to say about

259
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,960
 Guff very quickly oh good which is that I'm going to Australia next year if you're in Australia and

260
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:56,080
 have a spare bed please get in touch on New Zealand I am going to fly out almost immediately

261
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,800
 after the coronation which is I think the coronation is six of me I'm probably going to fly on the

262
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:08,160
 night and I'm going to return on about the 15th or 73th or 18th of June something like that depending

263
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,200
 on exact timings and what flights are and something like that so a bit over a month and I'm intended

264
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:21,920
 to go to at least Perth Adelaide Melbourne Sydney and Wellington and I may go to extra places well

265
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,200
 if you're in one of those extra places and you have a spare bed so get in touch really I just

266
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,320
 want to meet Australian New Zealand fans that's all I'm doing so yeah really looking forward to it

267
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,680
 and in order to support that I'm going to have a pre-trip report which will be available at Easter

268
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,240
 you heard it here first which conventions are you going to go to don't know if there's going to be

269
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,400
 a convention going to do the trip anyway because it's time we need to run a northbound race

270
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,720
 for 2024 so I need to travel next year so Australian fans get planning your conventions

271
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,920
 come on I have been poking but it's really I mean the the New Zealand that cons going to be virtual

272
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,480
 and I will be at it but it's going to be virtual

273
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:16,720
 okay so smoth gone there was a contested smoth con this time I tried looking this up on the internet

274
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,320
 but I couldn't find much detail but Liz knows about it so take it away Liz

275
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,160
 I'll only know about it because of what I read about it on the internet which is mostly on

276
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,880
 Facebook yeah I think I did check on Fars 717 I couldn't find any uh rating about this

277
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,080
 so uh what what I saw was a bid was proposed for smoth con in Sweden

278
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,160
 so there was a bid proposed for Stockholm but there was also a second bid that was set up

279
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,040
 that had been set up a bit earlier I think for Providence Road Island and it appears that

280
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:59,040
 the Providence bid won I think they were both set up at fairly short notice so hopefully Sweden

281
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:05,600
 will bid again because it would be nice to have uh smoth cons in Europe every often I'm I know

282
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,680
 there's one in there's one in 2020 Alice in went Alice in was there's an off con 2020 in Lisbon?

283
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:18,960
 uh no it's 2021 nothing was in 2020 oh okay yes very enough and so yeah it's nice to have

284
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
 another sort of thing I thought I think it would have been nice to have one kind of not long before

285
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,000
 a UK world con but maybe actually you're better having them slightly after UK world cons then

286
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,240
 anyone who's got excited by Glasgow can then continue to come to Swaffa so it's not come when

287
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,600
 it will be in Providence but apparently they have committed to a substantial like having a substantial

288
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,160
 hybrid con as well yeah now I'd have really liked to have been in Sweden because I had infinite fun

289
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,080
 at the Lisbon's soft con I'd like to go to another European soft con true but one maybe it will be

290
00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:01,200
 there after the 2024 world con which be nice and two it may not be quite as nice weather

291
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,120
 in dot com in December as it was in Lisbon I do have a problem with the soft con weekend

292
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,680
 which I'm going to get to foreshadowing all right then that was all I had to say on

293
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,720
 the soft cons have fun Providence road island Providence does sound like quite a nice place to

294
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,120
 go to for a convention actually I probably could be pretty good I want to go there at some point

295
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,240
 at some point I want to go to all the places Lovecraft light wrote about uh and obviously

296
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,720
 Providence would be on that list.

297
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,000
 Wandering shop so uh Mastodon we've all been

298
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,520
 masturbating over on Mastodon except for Liz who hasn't I've got an account I just haven't

299
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:51,280
 actually done anything with it yet lizz is to be fair the podcast musk fan so you know it makes

300
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:57,680
 sense oh oh you take that back that is a joke too far

301
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,520
 are you lizz bat a at mast dot two yes she's got on the wandering shop Liz is where all the

302
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,080
 cool kids are by which I mean Alison and I because wandering shop was closed still is it took ages

303
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:17,600
 to go there wandering shop is still quite closed in that every week existing wandering shop members

304
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,400
 get a link that they can invite people and and I think it's like 50 a week or 100 a week so it's

305
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,440
 growing slowly but the last couple of times they've released code I have got a friend or two in on

306
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,800
 it so if if you know me and you want to get on wandering shop then get in touch and when I have

307
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:41,200
 a an invite I will get it to you but wandering shop is very nice because it is an instance I think

308
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,480
 Chris Rose is the primary person behind it and well done Chris this is good thing it's a server

309
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:56,160
 primarily for science fiction and fantasy community generally so including authors editors and fans

310
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:03,360
 and readers and obviously that makes it kind of it's got a great feeling it reminds me a bit of

311
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,480
 records as a fandom and records as they've written if you're very old so the local the local feed is

312
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,680
 full of people saying stuff that's interesting and I just really really like it there and

313
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:22,160
 masted on itself imagine twitter without all the corporate shilling and politics I mean it can't

314
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,520
 last obviously but it's very very nice at the moment no but it is it is basically quite good

315
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:34,320
 I was on another instance originally which I also quite liked but they defederated the big

316
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,880
 server and that meant that there were several people I wanted to follow and couldn't I was

317
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,040
 extremely annoying if you don't know what that means listeners it's not important and if you do

318
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,000
 you understand why it's annoying it means go and ask Allison she'll tell you in detail but yes

319
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,840
 no wandering shop is good and if you are in the science fiction fandom space is an instance which

320
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:01,360
 is designed for you to enjoy so yeah is good instance to go for if there are sign-ups and like I say

321
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,120
 Allison and I both have both have access to the codes so yeah if you want to be on there let's

322
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,760
 know and then when the codes come out you have a very short window to get on it but it's been

323
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,760
 lengthening recently it's not me so bad so I know Raj is on masted on on the masted on dot scott

324
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,760
 service there's like scottish one there's a bunch of different ones it's cool if you are on a masted

325
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,520
 on server one of the things about masted on being run from the ground up by people rather than run

326
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,840
 by big industry is that that means that people who are probably people you know if you're on a

327
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,960
 fairly small server need money to keep it going so do throw small amounts of money at the admins to

328
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,720
 keep your servers running because otherwise this entire business bottle is going to fail and we

329
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,800
 will go back to something where you don't pay anything except your soul to be on there you're

330
00:29:52,800 --> 00:30:01,360
 very so yeah I mean you it is much better to just pay a small amount of money to get the thing that

331
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:09,920
 you want rather than not paying anything and in return getting a torrent of garbage advertising

332
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:23,040
 posts in your feed all of the time all right shall we do picks yeah Liz what's your pick do you

333
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,000
 want to start with it yeah so my pick is I mean I pick it not without reservations but basically

334
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,280
 the only book I've read over the past few weeks is Stephen King's It because it was on my Kindle

335
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,120
 and so I thought oh that might be good I'll start reading it and when it's on your Kindle you can't

336
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:44,160
 tell that it is actually 1500 pages it's a very long book so basically we're ahead an entire trilogy

337
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,560
 yeah it is an early Stephen King book I hadn't read if you've read lots of Stephen King books you

338
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:55,360
 kind of know what you are getting which is small town American horror but it's just a kind of really

339
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,640
 well-done example of the form I think so it's got two intertwining plot strands one in the late 1950s

340
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:10,080
 and one in the 1980s and it kind of into times and really well so you get this kind of impending

341
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:17,040
 sense of you know from the 1980s plot strand that in the 1950s they essentially went to kill the

342
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:24,400
 demon creature that lives beneath their town and basically ends up on a murder spree every 20

343
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,640
 something years and from the fact they're back in 1980 you know that they did not actually do the

344
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,560
 job first time round and basically it enshrines all the plots and they build to the fact they were

345
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,280
 getting the kind of first battle with this creature and the second battle kind of happening both at

346
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,160
 the end of the novel but in totally different time strands so you know where it's going to end up

347
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,680
 and you know it's quite digressive it spends a lot of time on the inhabitants of this small

348
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,960
 town and building up the small town feel but I think it does pay off in the end maybe not quite

349
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,160
 to the extent of needing 1500 pages but I felt quite satisfied with it at the end of it and it's

350
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,840
 just really good at this sort of individual scenes of there's a part where Mike one of the

351
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,840
 children they've been there kind of pre-preetines goes off to the site of an explosion and basically

352
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,040
 is menaced by an enormous bird and when I just say that it sounds like it might be quite funny but

353
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,440
 it's a really menacingly written section where he is in Otterra of this colossal bird which is

354
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,840
 chasing after him and trying to kill him and it's just full of kind of like little chapters like

355
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,760
 that which do really well at building up this creeping sense of horror if you read any Stephen

356
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,440
 King books you probably know that's why you're reading Stephen King books right so yeah still

357
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,600
 recommended but very long so I have a confession which is I've never read any Stephen King oh you

358
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,440
 probably should yeah I knew this was coming it's just like yeah yeah I've never read me and I should

359
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,840
 what I want to do so I know that there is a novella called The Mist yes which is very famous I think

360
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,280
 and I want to read that because I'm a parody of myself and it was the inspiration for one of the

361
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,040
 later Arkham Horror of the card game scenarios as far as I watch read that and then I'm like

362
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:07,360
 probably more of his stuff given I quite like horror so yes at some point I will get to it in my

363
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,120
 copious spare time I have read a very small amount of Stephen King and it's one of things that help

364
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,120
 form my view that I do not really like horror very much and in fact I tend to go off things if

365
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,160
 they have too much horror in them so I'm not going to be reading a 1500 page horror novel anytime soon

366
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,240
 but John should definitely read Stephen King oh I've read Carrie Carrie's amazing I loved Carrie

367
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,240
 I'd forgotten that so you have read some Stephen King there yeah yeah we read it in book club

368
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,440
 when I was on grad and it was amazing very very creepy I've very much enjoyed it yeah I mean the

369
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,920
 thing about that so I have read the myth the thing about the myth is that famously there is a film

370
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:52,480
 adaptation of The Mist which changes the ending in a way I will not spoil but is really very grim

371
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,560
 hey yeah I think that's as good a good as good a place as any to start yeah basically don't start

372
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:05,040
 with one of his you know 1500 page works although they are you know the stand is also pretty good

373
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,720
 but yeah Carrie I think would be would have been a place I would say you could start if I hadn't

374
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,240
 only read it or you know something like Misery is also good Salem's lot quite a lot the early ones

375
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,800
 are pretty good mm-mm Alison do you want to do yours so I had never been to Dragon Meat which is a

376
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,280
 one-day tabletop gaming convention in London um for a couple of reasons it's the smothcon weekend so

377
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:37,360
 yeah that's the thing but also um I'd always gone to a big house party on that day so it clashes

378
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,920
 with that and at the moment the big house party isn't happening so that sounds like a good reason

379
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,200
 to go across London and go to a games convention what what happened was that it's run by John Dodd

380
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,800
 who is doing a site for a lot of conventions at the moment including um Eastercon so and he said

381
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,200
 to the rest of us and also to try to pledge for committee why don't you all come to Dragon Meat

382
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,480
 and I'll put your names on the door and give you a table and you can promote the Eastcon so we did

383
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,880
 that and we had a lot of fun and we were in a lovely kind of science fictiony area of the Dragon Meat

384
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,680
 Trading Halls with third vault your yarns and um the BSFA and the BFS and Ian Waits like New

385
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,960
 Compress and and a few other things like that and it was awesome um and we talked to lots of people

386
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,880
 some of whom were already coming to the Eastcon some of whom said they would definitely join but

387
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,280
 hadn't got around to it yet some of whom had um heard about Eastercons but weren't sure they were

388
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,760
 for them and some of whom had never heard of Eastercons and some of those were like oh that sounds

389
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,880
 amazing that sounds wonderful so hopefully some of those will come and it was all pretty good um

390
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:50,800
 I had an accident at Dragon Meat oh no are you okay I am not okay I was decluttering and I decided

391
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,920
 I would take a bag of games I did not want anymore for the Dragon Meat bring and buy sale and sell

392
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,360
 them and I would definitely not buy any games and bring them home and how did that go Alison?

393
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:09,520
 I bought how many games net did you acquire? I came home with seven more games that I took

394
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,840
 some of them were small for content listeners this was my birthday weekend and I had an enormous

395
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,600
 amount of birthday money and I bought fewer games than that yeah but I think you bought more

396
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,920
 expensive ones because one of the things about these games is that they were incredibly cheap

397
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,840
 hopefully I will play them and they will even go back to next year's Dragon Meat or I will

398
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,360
 pass them on to other people who would like them and they will not stay in my house forever but they

399
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,560
 might do but I feel like I have a lot of games in the house and they're mostly games from the 70s

400
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,920
 that are not very good and mixing them up for some more modern games some of which might be very

401
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,440
 good uh it's probably a good bet but it was so good it has so much fun and um it's full of it's

402
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,680
 full of nerds full of full of our sorts of people sensitive faddish faces and and the trading halls

403
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,760
 are like a magic cave full of games it was very good there were an enormous number of people

404
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,640
 wanting to sell me very expensive dice that I was like how much is it reasonable to pay for

405
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,080
 dice the answer is not that much I mean you got octa-thunk dice what more do you need I like the dice

406
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,840
 that had liquid centers I thought liquid center dice were pretty good have you seen the dice that

407
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,360
 look like baked beans oh I see the baked bean dice yeah they're horrible they're great did I did

408
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,440
 dice I have not seen dice that looked like baked beans but somebody was selling uh I will put a link

409
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,480
 in the show notes listeners they have they're doing a kickstarter for solid foam dice about that

410
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,240
 sort of size that you you throw at people as a game and there's gonna be a kickstarter next year

411
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,920
 and I'm like oh oh this this great this looks awesome for the listeners Alison is holding her

412
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,440
 hand up about you know two or three inches long yeah maybe about six or six centimeters across

413
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,680
 maybe seven because for all the readers now you could have been holding your hands up like this

414
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,240
 like three feet apart which would also be fun but different the reason I think why the trading

415
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,720
 halls are so amazing is that the first Saturday in December is if you were going to

416
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:11,600
 run an event focused around selling games crap the first Saturday in December would be quite a good

417
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:18,160
 time to do that yep um and the bring a buy oh the bring a buy and all credit to the people who'd

418
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,760
 sorted out the website for the bring a buy because you actually you registered your games in advance

419
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,800
 with how much you wanted to sell them for and it was way easier than listing things on ebay i'll

420
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,520
 tell you and then when you got to the convention they basically bridged out bocos stick on your

421
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,520
 games in approximately one nanosecond and then you could sit at your sales table for the eastercon

422
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,120
 every so often you'd search through the list of available games by price from low to high and

423
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:51,120
 go god that looks like a bargain and nip round and buy it so yeah i was in my happy place which is

424
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,280
 buying crap to fill up my house there's already full of crap wait no i like games conventions i

425
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,160
 haven't been to uh dragon meat but i have been to other games conventions and they are a lot of fun

426
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,240
 and there was an Arkham horror event a dragon meat uh which apparently went very well i didn't

427
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,040
 actually play any games because it didn't really have any time because we were on our table all day

428
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,360
 and um had the truest expression of the games convention buying stuff while not playing anything

429
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,120
 also i don't i think if it was a two-day convention i'd probably get some games in

430
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:26,160
 and i used to love a games convention called stabcon which when i went to it didn't really have any

431
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,000
 traders at all it just had a load of people in the room i didn't have any organized games it didn't

432
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,840
 have any traders it just had a load of people in the room playing games and i really really like that

433
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,280
 stabcon is still stabcon is still quite like that so so i mean like and you just sit around

434
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,640
 waiting for somebody to pull out a game that looked interesting and then you go

435
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,720
 oooh do you need players and they go yes and you sit down and play and then a couple of hours later

436
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,880
 you do it again until the end of the day it's good and then i think we all stayed at a student

437
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,200
 accommodation that was some of the worst accommodation i've ever slept in but you know that sort of thing

438
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:02,240
 stabcon south is held at the hilton double tree in salampton i went once twice i think i went

439
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,440
 once and then the pandemic happened it was very sad but it was a good convention it had two traders

440
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,400
 and a lot of games and i played a lot of wealth and it was pretty great games conventions are

441
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,640
 weird for me because i got into science fiction conventions and games conventions at roughly the

442
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,800
 same time and i was like oh science fiction is a convention it's a good but like what i really

443
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,960
 like is games conventions and then i changed my mind because i kind of basically went oh i can

444
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,560
 play games anytime but i can only get the science fiction convention experience at science fiction

445
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,480
 convention the thing i like about games conventions is playing games that haven't come out yet so like

446
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,480
 i have ruled that i don't back things on kickstarter unless i've played them but games conventions are

447
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,800
 a good way of playing games that are shortly coming to kickstarter to see if you like them before

448
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,760
 the wrong kickstarter for instance okay so the great thing about having ignored the tabletop gaming

449
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,360
 hobby for the last 40 years is there's an awful lot of games i haven't played yet it's certainly good

450
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,280
 oh no that's fair that is fair when there are failure modes like i played a game at the convention

451
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,640
 in 2019 which was amazing and it still has not made it to kickstarter so i'm like champing at the bit

452
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:11,840
 yeah i met Francis Tresham at a games convention in about 1985 and he was like oh here's my follow-up

453
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,200
 game to Spanish main which was his game at the time and um and we played that and it was really

454
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:26,560
 weird and that level what should i do anyway i am gonna pick a thing a series of 15 comics and a

455
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,400
 series of 13 comics and a series of three novels and a series of three ya novels and two mangers

456
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,720
 and some other bits and bobs and an audiobook because i'm picking phase one of the star wars

457
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,080
 high republic project which i have finished reading the people who write star wars books got together

458
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,240
 and they were like it's really annoying that when we write star wars books about bits of star wars

459
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,560
 that are being done on telly and in the movies the telly and movies keep contradicting the things

460
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,640
 we want to do and wouldn't it be nice if we had a little bit of the universe we could play in

461
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,920
 where no one else is telling us what's going to happen and so they did that it's called the

462
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,440
 high republic it's about 200 years before um the rest of star wars and i finished it and it is

463
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,640
 really good i liked it a great deal basically focused around the jedi at the height of their

464
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,800
 success and the republic are kind of forging out into the wider galaxy from the core worlds and

465
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,600
 they hit upon a group of pirates called the nai hill and it's basically about what ends up happening

466
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,720
 then and then the last book is very sad and uh i spent ages reading it because it really stressed

467
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,080
 me out it was very good i'm just a coward and then they're starting phase two and phase two is weirdly

468
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,920
 a prequel which i guess makes sense because if you're going to do a three act star war you start

469
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,640
 in the middle and then do the before bit and then do the after bit and that is well established

470
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:50,480
 in star wars lore it's kind of what uh roguan and andor have done and also i will say the audio

471
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,960
 production was amazing it was forecast and it reminded me of like listening to like radio for

472
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,680
 um stuff and hearing that kind of thing done in audiobooks is really neat and i hope there's more

473
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,520
 of that in the future um although it will reignite the discussions about best dramatic presentation

474
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,720
 audio best audio presentation hugo for the win i mean to be fair i could submit it in the best

475
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,520
 long form category but i don't think it would win compared to severance and or everything ever

476
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,640
 at once so you know do we have two more nominations for that category i have to talk about this in

477
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:29,040
 our hugo nomination episode in january our listeners can write in writing listeners anyway that was

478
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:44,960
 the old thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

479
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,440
 and for those who don't know alison's ex is mike scott thank you very much for it again mike

480
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,440

481
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:16,080

482
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,760
 him for a reason guys but it wasn't that it's fine right i don't know that's what i am asking

483
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,240
 i'm happy if i had if i hadn't wanted to do the podcast i wouldn't have said it love you mike

484
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,760
 i feel it is unfair that you would never get a name we do have to give him you know no one else

485
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,440
 is on the podcast no one else's letters are oh referred to in in terms of their relationship to
