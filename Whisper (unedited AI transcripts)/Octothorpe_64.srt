1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 I know I had a joke on one of the letters, let me find it.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,320
 I can't remember, I cannot remember.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,200
 If you remember the joke, record a pickup and get John to drop it in and we'll fake some laughter.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:34,560
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 64th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for Science Fiction

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,400
 and Science Fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 18th of August 2022. I'm John Coxon.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,720
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Ms Batty and we're like eight squared Octa Thorpe.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,600
 Oh yeah we are.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,240
 Will you still need me? Will you still feed me? etc.

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,600
 We're going to get banned from like Apple podcasts if you think that.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,360
 Not if I sing it, it's fine.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,520
 Liberty will notice.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:08,000
 First up we'd like to apologise to Andr and Caroline who's emails to us got caught in a spam trap

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,800
 and as a result we have changed our email address to comment@octa Thorpecast.uk

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,680
 and we are hoping that this will resolve any future issues.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
 So if you're emailing us, please note the change in email address.

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,040
 We will carry on checking the old one for a little bit including the spam trap but do

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,240
 send stuff to the new address.

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,200
 Yes.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,920
 So Andr wrote in about episode 62 to say that she had read one of the Hugo nominees which is

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,400
 a master of Jin which is unusual because she doesn't usually have a Worldcom membership and

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,760
 when she does she doesn't usually download much of the voter packet.

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,040
 I mean and agrees with me about Chard's worth being great so and thank you for writing in.

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,320
 You're my favourite now.

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,680
 She also says that she thinks she is an optimistic nihilist based on my explanation of my views

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,560
 and that is entirely sensible I think.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,160
 Caroline also emailed us about OctaOpt62 because she is also reading all of the Hugo

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,400
 shortlisted novels this year and she says that she is also stranded with the last one part read

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,120
 which in her case was the master of Jin and she was stranded a third through because she wasn't

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,040
 really enjoying it and she says that it and she who became the son were the two that she had to

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,120
 finish for duty rather than for love which is pleasing because that feels like it's like a theme

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,800
 in both those books you know duty versus personal life so that's good that is good to

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,560
 exposition Caroline thank you very much.

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,280
 Yeah thank you all to Caroline I think she picked up on a few things that we didn't mention

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,320
 and in my case it was probably because I hadn't thought about them but there were a few things

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,080
 I realised you know there were whole swathes of stuff about the novels that we didn't mention

36
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,440
 so maybe next time it has to be not only like a bumper episode but maybe a bumper

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,120
 bumper episode to fit all the Hugo novels in there really was a lot to discuss.

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
 Yes.

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,680
 OctaOpt.

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,880
 Special extended edition.

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,280
 Indeed indeed.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,600
 Mark Plummer writes I've just learnt that Galactic Journey is blocked on my office

43
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,000
 IT network with the stated reason being marijuana and if you have ever been to 1967 you know why.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,320
 That's my joke sorry guys.

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,280
 Excellent.

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,360
 And Mark also says that he's very grateful to John for telling him about Knights of the Old Republic

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,680
 and he's expecting it to in the weeks of time to come fill up as much of his time as playing Arkham

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,320
 Horror Dust.

49
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,920
 Excellent.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,960
 And he thought that it was great for the creator of the Great Potato War

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,160
 is a YouTuber.

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,360
 Oh.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,000
 That is great Mark.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,520
 Thank you very much and it also gives us our episode title so that's nice.

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,480
 He also says that he was thinking of me earlier when he was looking through Kevin Smith's

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,800
 TAF report which has just come out and is a report of the TAFTrip in 1982 and there's a passage

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
 that says along with the badges there were ribbons.

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,160
 My Yellow Ribbon said program on it and meant I was taking part in programed events.

59
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,200
 It is entirely possible to have more than one ribbon and obviously I have never had more than

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,320
 one ribbon at a convention.

61
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,120
 I am very ribbon minimalist and anyone who is at WorldCom will be able to see the extent to which

62
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,000
 that is a lie.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,760
 I think I drew you as a ribbon collector once.

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,440
 For my TAFT report.

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,080
 Yeah.

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,640
 On your TAFT report also now available.

67
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,320
 There'll be a link to the show notes.

68
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,040
 And I think I did put all of my ribbons in my TAFT report by my Be Misremembering.

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
 But I think you can see it if you buy it.

70
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,320
 Well done to Kevin Smith for getting his TAFT report out after only 40 years.

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,600
 Is this a record?

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,000
 Bill Higgins wrote to us and said, well this is going to be much shorter than it usually is

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,800
 when he heard me open the podcasts with the words hello everyone and welcome to the 62nd

74
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,480
 episode of Octa Thorpe.

75
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,440
 So thank you very much.

76
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,040
 Bill, Mark, you don't get the prize for most tortured joke in this episode which is weird

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,680
 but you're up against very stiff competition.

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
 But thank you very much to Bill for airing.

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,560
 I believe I'm on a panel with Bill at WorldCom which we will discuss later in the episode.

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,280
 For shadowing and stuff.

81
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
 For shadowing and stuff.

82
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,480
 Oh, we should talk about our schedules.

83
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,000
 Yes.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
 We shall.

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,760
 And we got a letter from Chris Garcia.

86
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,880
 Yay.

87
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,640
 We also had a letter from Chris Garcia.

88
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,160
 Chris Garcia, please write in and tell us how you got the omelet jeff to do you a no egg omelet

89
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,800
 or was it just kind of a plate of emptiness.

90
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
 Or in fact, no, right.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
 And just tell me in a couple of weeks time.

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,800
 Yep, indeed.

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,480
 Yeah, if you're going to see a such icon you don't need to write, you can just tell us things.

94
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,200
 But if you want them to appear on the podcast, right.

95
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,880
 That's comment@octashopecast.uk.

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:56,000
 We also got a tweet from Raj and Raj said thank you for pointing them to the Hugo Girl podcast.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,680
 You're very welcome, Raj. And on the subject of Hugo Girl, we had a big old discussion on Twitter

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,120
 about hotel eggs. And, you know, go and read that if you like eggs.

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:21,840
 We have submitted our Hugo Ballots and we're going to talk a little bit about what we put where.

100
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,600
 Shall I talk about the Briarly voting competence threshold?

101
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,200
 Which is the notion that you should only vote in a category if you have actually

102
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,720
 absorbed all of the things in that category well enough to have appropriate opinions on

103
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
 where they should be ranked.

104
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,360
 And I'm not sure I normally do this in very many categories.

105
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
 I think that's also true this year.

106
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,880
 So I did vote in all the categories in which I was competent to vote under that standard,

107
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,720
 which was novel and all the fan categories.

108
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,560
 I think that was it.

109
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,840
 And I also voted in a load of other categories just because.

110
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,000
 So if you ever wonder whether people vote from positions of ignorance in the

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Hugos, it's right they do. I'm sorry.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,920
 And I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I voted for short story for reasons that I will

113
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,080
 explain later despite the fact that I hadn't read them all.

114
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,640
 And I voted for novel for novella for because I had only read some of them,

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,720
 but I've really enjoyed the ones I read and I thought they were very worthy of winning a Hugo.

116
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
 So how do you guys stand on the broadly voting competence threshold?

117
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,920
 Voted in best novel, best novella, best novel at best short story, best series,

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,200
 best dramatic presentation, long for best direct presentation, short for best

119
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,280
 edit, short form, best professional artist, best semi-prosean, best fanzine, best fan cast,

120
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,080
 best fan writer, best fan artist, load start understanding.

121
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
 I voted in exactly the same category as John, it turns out.

122
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,640
 So my little rant here is because of the current 20% threshold,

123
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,240
 I feel I need to vote in every category where I feel qualified to cast a vote at all.

124
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,760
 That is more than I can possibly read.

125
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,640
 The Hugo ballot at the moment contains more than I can possibly read between the date that

126
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,520
 the finalists come out and the date when voting closes, because it's six novels,

127
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,120
 it's six books in the load star awards, it's six novelettes,

128
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,960
 it's six pieces of short fiction or more for this Downing Award,

129
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,920
 in this case, at least three of them were nominated based on books,

130
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,240
 and then we got into best series, which is, and it happens that I have read like part of a couple

131
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,760
 of series, but that's by it, and then I haven't spent the 12 or 15 hours or whatever it is,

132
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,160
 I would need to watch everything in best dramatic presentation, long form, too much stuff.

133
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,800
 Yeah, so the three categories I voted in in which I did not have a view of everything were

134
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,200
 dramatic presentation, short form, best editor, short form and best semi-prosean,

135
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,200
 and that's because I can't possibly read, I voted in semi-prosean and best editor, short form,

136
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,480
 and I think, although best series, I didn't, I also didn't read all the series, but I actually

137
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,000
 find that editor, short form and best pro and best semi-prosean are the two that are most

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,200
 difficult to get a wide view of, because it does involve a lot of reading, and because I read

139
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,920
 series because they are one of the bits of science fiction I actually engage with,

140
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,880
 I'm usually got quite the head start on that category, whereas like I read one semi-prosean

141
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,880
 every year. Which one? Uncanny. I noticed when I was reading short fiction that the uncanny

142
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,400
 selection of fiction had a load of fantastic things in, and also that uncanny had a lot of things

143
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,600
 that when I was doing my short fiction reading, I really quite liked, so yeah, no, I might be

144
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,040
 joining you and subscribing to Uncanny because it's full of things I liked. Yeah, I mean Uncanny,

145
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,160
 there is a reason it keeps winning best semi-prosean, and that is generally because it is very good,

146
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,480
 and I, I subscribe to it. I use Subscribe to Clark's World, and I eventually unsubscribed,

147
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,600
 because I find Clark's World's editorial voice quite, if you read it for a couple of years,

148
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,520
 you start seeing there's very much a formula to what goes into a Clark's World story that I

149
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,120
 started to get quite irritated with, whereas I find Uncanny a little bit more varied, although I

150
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,160
 think if you read any magazine for long enough, you start to see the, the kind of the recurring themes,

151
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,200
 and sometimes it can get a little bit frustrating. I also, I used to listen to Escape Pod, and I,

152
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,280
 I voted for Escape Pod because I very much want Escape Pod to win. I think it would be good to

153
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,800
 recognise the work they do, and that is also why I voted for Laffeti and Divya for editor short form,

154
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,520
 but shall we go through our ballots? I'm happy to pull some highlights out of my ballot.

155
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,480
 We can do some highlights, I think. By a figure, we can say what we vote, we put top in like each of

156
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
 the categories we voted in. Yeah, the short, or Lisa short, let's try the short fiction ones and

157
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,280
 see how far we get without running out of time. All right, so what did we all put top in the

158
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:54,640
 Vella? I put the Pastors Red by Catherine Valenti. Oh, I put that second, I put a sum for the wild

159
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,000
 built as first. I put the Elder Race first and a sum for the wild built second, and I confess I

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,880
 haven't read the Calc Valenti so I'm feeling very guilty now. I will read it though. I will say

161
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,160
 that to my great surprise having not really enjoyed the eyes of the Becky Chambers novels I've read,

162
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,960
 I put a sum for the wild built third as well with Elder Race in second. This sounds like our maybe

163
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,240
 top three are quite settled there, but I did find a sum for the wild built maybe just because

164
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,520
 it was a shorter length worked much, much better for me than the galaxy in the ground within did.

165
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,400
 When I think having read Chambers' novella that was nominated last year, year before,

166
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,000
 I thought it was very different to her novels. I mean, I enjoy both, but it doesn't surprise me that

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,120
 there, that you might have quite a different opinion on them because I do think she is doing

168
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,760
 quite different things in the two. I think the one from Tovea Year is actually more different from

169
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,440
 her novels than some for the wild built is, but I did enjoy both quite a lot. And I did enjoy,

170
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,040
 I put Elder Race third. I thought it was very good. I know we're not doing a long talk about the

171
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,400
 things, but I thought the fact that a sum for the wild built and the Elder Race both have this

172
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:12,080
 theme of the separation of different cultures and people getting together unexpectedly with

173
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,280
 a culture that the cultures have been long separated was really interesting. And they had quite a lot

174
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,840
 of points of commonality. I enjoyed them both very much indeed. I was really pleased to have read them.

175
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,040
 You have inadvertently noticed a theme in the past is read as well, interestingly.

176
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:37,920
 I think it's interesting because they're all about that, right? In a way, maybe not a spindle

177
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:46,480
 splintered as such, but certainly they're all stories of culture clashes. Like Fireheart Tiger

178
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,080
 is, and across the Greengrass Fields definitely is. I mean, I did, I will say again, I enjoyed

179
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,160
 everything in this category quite a lot. I think there's a little bit of a gap between the top

180
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,080
 three and the bottom three, but I did enjoy all of the bottom three. I would agree. I mean,

181
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,080
 I would say the thing in the top three is it's kind of a culture clash, maybe between

182
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,640
 civilizations at different levels of progression and industrialization, which is maybe not present

183
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,440
 in the lower ones. That was quite interesting. Yeah. So maybe the Macquire had that. But I like

184
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,840
 that Valenti kind of ties that one back. I thought it was a good novel tackling climate change in

185
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,280
 a way the other two are not looking at. Yeah, definitely. And actually reminded me of one of

186
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:38,560
 the themes from Horizon Forbidden West. Novelette, what did we put in novelette? I put the bots of

187
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,760
 the Lost Ark by Suzanne Palmer. I guess I had a really hard time deciding between them, but I

188
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,240
 ended up with that story isn't the story by John Wizwell at the top from Oncanny. So,

189
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,760
 Alison, did you vote in novelette? I didn't vote, but I've since read several of these stories.

190
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,720
 I really liked unsely brothers, but I thought it was a little, I thought it was a tiny bit slight,

191
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,600
 but I really, really enjoyed it. So, you know, I liked so many things about it. That's interesting.

192
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,360
 And I did like that story isn't the story. I thought that was very clever, but it was kind of,

193
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,000
 I was sitting in a field in the glorious sunshine listening to fantastic music and

194
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,640
 it wasn't the story I wanted to be reading right then. So, that's not the fault of the story, it's a

195
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,000
 fault of me. I put that story isn't the story was a strong third. Very much enjoyed that. I,

196
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,280
 when I read it in Oncanny gave on Silly Brothers three out of five and it languishes in fourth on

197
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,000
 my ballad. Again, I thought it was, I thought there was quite a gap between my top three and my bottom

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,640
 three. And I, I thought this is probably the weakest category on the ballad. I don't know if that's fair.

199
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,360
 Short story? Short story. I think we might be unanimous here. Oh, do you reckon? What did you

200
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,520
 put first Liz? Where Oak and Hearts together. Alison, what did you put first? I have to say,

201
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,720
 I loved one of the stories in this category so inordinately that I've put it as my pick this week.

202
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,720
 Which I know is why I was saying that. And that's not surprising because that story was cat lit for

203
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,000
 Alison's. I mean, if somebody has sat down to write a story that Alison would love, they could not

204
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,520
 have done better. It was fantastic. So, and that is where Oak and, where Oak and Hearts together.

205
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,360
 I put it in second, thought it was a strong second. What did you put first? Mr. Death,

206
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,040
 because I cried like a baby at the end, just a story had everything for me. Oh, I put that second,

207
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,240
 I have not read that story yet. So, like it just hit me straight in the feels listeners,

208
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,560
 just like this is my feels. That's the story. Boom, but both very good.

209
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,720
 I put it in second on the grounds I cried but did not feel like emotionally manipulated into it.

210
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,800
 And I think that is a very, very hard line to walk. It's such a beautiful ending and it feels,

211
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,200
 it feels simultaneously so earned, but I didn't see it coming. And I think that's a really,

212
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
 sorry Alison. Alison hasn't read it and is very enthusiastically.

213
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,880
 We're not going to spoil it, we just say we cried. I'll read it between now and when I get the

214
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:16,400
 transcript to do. I did also like, I liked very much all of these stories. I think Tangles was

215
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,920
 my least favorite, but I feel like if it hadn't been a story written from Magic the Gathering,

216
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,560
 it would have been better. It's told very straightforwardly, which I assume is at least

217
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,200
 part because that tends to be what franchise short stories call for. I really, I started

218
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,720
 really, really liking Tangles and then I felt it kind of wound up in a way that was a little

219
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,600
 bit unsatisfying. But having now noticed that it's a Magic story which I had not noticed,

220
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,800
 it's like, oh no, that makes perfect sense now. I do, yeah. But I mean, and very, very good.

221
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,800
 Again, very strong category, I thought. Best series. Best series.

222
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,440
 I'm like, I haven't read anything in this one. That was a problem. Rather read a tiny bit.

223
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,440
 I have only read three in this category. The world of the white rat, I read one of them and it was

224
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,400
 fantastic. And I will read the rest enthusiastically by did not have time in the deadline. I have

225
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,400
 been reading the way with children series as we've been going through the hugos over the last few

226
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,720
 years because they keep getting nominated. And then Terra Ignota by Ada Palmer. Now,

227
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:28,960
 too like the Lightning was a finalist while back. And I confess, sorry, Neil, I did not really like it.

228
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,600
 And so I put, so that affected my rating. But I did not get to any of the series. I had not,

229
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,040
 I had not read any of already, if that makes sense, except for the Kingfisher,

230
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,440
 slash Vernon title, which I put first. Well, again, I've read, John, I've read exactly the same as you

231
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,400
 apart from the, I haven't read the Vernon, but I didn't get to it. I read too like the Lightning,

232
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,160
 and I've read all the way with children because they're on the Hugo ballots in previous years.

233
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,600
 I wonder if that will affect the voting in this category. It might, it might well. I wonder whether

234
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,600
 Vernon will take it because, I mean, she's great. I mean, I've liked everything of hers I've read,

235
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,160
 so I wouldn't be surprised. Yep. But I also wouldn't be surprised to see where

236
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
 with children take it because I think it's an excellent series of novellas.

237
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,520
 I did feel bad not, not reading the Stross because that was in the packet. And I did,

238
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,480
 I did, I fully intended to read it and I just ran out of time. It was, it would have been my next

239
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,080
 book, because I read series after astounding and load star. But Jade City by Fondalee

240
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,960
 wasn't in the packet at all. And the CL Polk series, they'd put the third installment in,

241
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,840
 and I kept thinking I should probably start at the beginning. And then I did not get around to it.

242
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,560
 I put for dramatic presentation long form in Canto in first. I love that movie quite a bit.

243
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,720
 Again, this is one of the categories I thought was weaker than most of the ballot. I didn't think

244
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,800
 it was a strong showing for dramatic presentation this year. I think there are quite a few movies

245
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,400
 that people told me about that did not make it on here that I think are probably better than

246
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,680
 some of the ones. I put June first because I loved it despite the fact that it's only half a movie

247
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,240
 and it doesn't really do anything. And there's a lot of things wrong with it. I still loved it.

248
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,840
 That's good though, don't it? Really just for the,

249
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:23,280
 or for copters, what's that called? Ornacopters, yeah, loved them.

250
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,840
 Ornicopters. I just can't say why I liked it. In Canto got my second vote,

251
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,280
 because I also thought that was very, very good. And if it hadn't, pulled its pudges in a shockingly

252
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,960
 Disney way at the very end, I would probably have put it first.

253
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,760
 Yeah, I vote the same as Alison with Wonder Vision in third, and I did not get around to watching

254
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:49,200
 the others. Best dramatic presentation short form. There's an obvious first choice here. I think

255
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,360
 Liz, what did you put in first choice? I mean, I thought there was a first choice, but I'm not

256
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,200
 sure it's gonna be the same as your first choice. What did you pick? I went with For All Mankind,

257
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,080
 because I really liked that episode. Oh, interesting. That was my second. And that is,

258
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,320
 I think, a strong second. I did love that episode, but now I went for Wedge Dodge.

259
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,960
 I have no idea if I'm pronouncing that correctly, because it's Klingon. I thought you would, yeah.

260
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,720
 But Star Trek Lower Decks is still a highlight of my genre watching, and it is fantastic.

261
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,440
 I had not watched any of Star Trek Lower Decks, and they put this episode into the packet.

262
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,560
 I didn't have needed to do that, because I have Amazon Prime, but I noticed it was in the packet,

263
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,880
 and I thought, "Oh, I'm supposed to be doing something else. I could definitely procrastinate

264
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,240
 and watch this instead of doing the thing I'm supposed to be doing." And it had the Hugo Award

265
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,840
 written over it, so I went and got it off Amazon Prime instead, and I went, "Oh, this is great,

266
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,640
 but I don't understand it, so let me watch the very first episode of Star Trek Lower Decks,

267
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,720
 and then this one." And I laughed, and laughed, and laughed, and laughed, and laughed, and it's not

268
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,360
 that. It's not necessarily great science fiction, and some of the humor is a bit juvenile, but,

269
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,200
 "Oh, I do like it a lot. I'm going to watch the whole of it now." Whenever I'm feeling miserable,

270
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,080
 I'm going to watch an episode of Star Trek Lower Decks till I catch up.

271
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,120
 That's how I gave it a vote, yes. But I am not competent to vote in this category, because,

272
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,800
 as you know, guys, I don't watch enough television. I also gave a vote to Feral Magkide on the grounds

273
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,840
 that it must... everyone who's actually watched it says it's very good, so, you know.

274
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,240
 But lots of people don't have Apple TV, so it probably won't win.

275
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,720
 I didn't watch, I didn't watch, I also watched Feral Magkide on the Expanse on Loki, but I didn't

276
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:46,400
 watch the other two, because, again, if you haven't seen the episode of... I mean, I'm never going to

277
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,000
 watch Wheel of Time. Sorry Wheel of Time fans, really not my cup of tea. And I am, arcane is on

278
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
 the big list of things I might watch at one point, because I have heard really good things,

279
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,480
 but the episode that got nominated was ninth. And so I would have had to watch four and a half

280
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,200
 to five hours of television to understand it, I think. And I was like, I do not have five hours

281
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,360
 spare, unfortunately. Especially because, very inconsiderately, all of the TV networks are

282
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,760
 releasing TV, like it's not August. And therefore, I've gained further and further behind with all

283
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,840
 of my watching. Cannot actually watch dramatic presentation to short form as if it were short form,

284
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,160
 because it isn't really, it's all like... It's never a short film or anything self-contained,

285
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,400
 it's always episode nine in a ten episode series. And so it's yet another thing that kind of demands

286
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,920
 a lot of attention. Though I do think Star Wars, Lower Decks, you didn't need to do much homework

287
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,760
 in order to enjoy that episode. And it was very funny, so well done. And it's quite nice having

288
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,640
 humour. It's quite a something funny science fiction in the ballot. I like that. I'd like to

289
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,680
 see some more of that, please. I mean, in a way, Lower Decks is building on the fact that you have,

290
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,280
 you know, 50 years of accumulated Star Trek in the public consciousness that makes it very funny.

291
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,840
 It's quite funny, even if you don't. It's got quite a lot of jokes that work. If you don't

292
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,920
 know the reference and then work on a different level, if you do, that's what this sort of humour

293
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,880
 should do, and I like that. I think I'm going to compare, and this might be hugely grandiose,

294
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,320
 I'm going to compare Lower Decks to Pixar. Hold on, strap in. I think Lower Decks does a really good

295
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,560
 job of having lots of jokes in it that work on a variety of different people. Like, you could have

296
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,880
 just seen DS9, and there will be jokes for you, and you could have just seen Voyager, and there will

297
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,560
 be jokes for you. You could have not seen anything, and there will be jokes for you. It's like a

298
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,400
 Pixar movie doing jokes for the kids and jokes for the grown-ups. Like, I think they're very good

299
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,560
 at it, because it's very easy to do jokes where you're like, I can tell that was a joke, and I don't

300
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,560
 get it, and now I feel left out, and I don't think Lower Decks does that, and I think that's a very

301
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,680
 difficult thing that it does very well. I mean, obviously, having seen lots of Star Trek, I do

302
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,480
 get some of the jokes, and I mean, we laugh very much. There are also jokes about the fandom, and

303
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,520
 ways in which they bring things about the fandom into Star Trek canon so they can make fun of them,

304
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,320
 and that is also very good. And it's just very good. I like it a great, great, great deal.

305
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,960
 Quite a lot of jokes about science fiction culture generally, and series is, and the whole structure

306
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,320
 of not being the stars, and things like that, I love it. It's so good.

307
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,520
 When you get to the episode with the plates in it, you're just texting.

308
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,960
 Oh yeah. It's not the best episode. That should have, that should have been all the balance.

309
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,840
 I actually will tell you which episode of The Dose to Put on the Ballot.

310
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,600
 Best commemorative plate. You go category.

311
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,760
 You heard it here first. Special, special award for Glasgow Esther. Come on, you've got to.

312
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,240
 Right, shall we talk about the load star? My Top Pick was Redemptor by Jordan Ifueku,

313
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,320
 which is a previous Octopic. I think Liz picked it maybe. I can't remember.

314
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,800
 I did pick it, and I also put it in first, but then I only read two books in this category. Sorry.

315
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,200
 I've really struggled in this category. I suspect I'm going to like a lot of the others,

316
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,040
 because I've liked previous books by Darcy Little Badger, and I've liked stuff by

317
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,760
 Chai Jin Anders, but I just did not get round to them, and I thought I should vote anyway.

318
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,720
 Yep. Have you read any of these, Alison?

319
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,000
 I've read about half of Victory's Greater Than Death.

320
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,120
 I would say one honourable mention for Chaos on CatNet, and the prequel, or not the prequel.

321
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,840
 It's a sequel. The original book in the series, which was Cat Fishing on CatNet, I think,

322
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,560
 which are both, which are very good, and I'm not sure. They both talk about abuse in really

323
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:40,000
 interesting ways, and I really liked that about them. I mean, and I very much liked a lot of the

324
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,680
 books in this category, but the Naomi Critzes are particularly ones I enjoyed as well.

325
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:52,400
 A astounding award. Me and Liz both put Miquaya Johnson in first. Have I guessed correctly, Liz?

326
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,920
 Yeah, guess correctly. Hey! And then I put Shelley Park Chan, and then I put

327
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:04,480
 Evarina Maxwell. Evarina Maxwell was my second. I really, really, really liked her book. I thought

328
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,440
 it was really good, and I enthusiastically recommended it to Nick, because it has "pining".

329
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,520
 And I was like, "You like pining? You all like this book?" And she was like, "Oh."

330
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,600
 It is, I mean, it is a lot of your A03 tags made into a book, as you might expect.

331
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,640
 I liked it a lot. But again, generally speaking, I think, loads of, sorry, astounding was a very

332
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,680
 strong category this year. There was only one author where the books they have written, I was like,

333
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,280
 "Eh, not sure. All the others wrote stuff I enjoyed."

334
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:44,320
 Moving swiftly onwards, what we're going to cover in our last 12 minutes?

335
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:53,120
 Worldcon schedules. All right, we've got some. Yeah, we do. I am on some panels. We're all on a

336
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,360
 panel called Hugo Award finalist rehearsal, but you can't come to that listeners. Apparently,

337
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,200
 there's no audience. Although that would be very funny. So yes, we're all doing that. And then,

338
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,840
 what else are you two doing? Liz, do you want to go first?

339
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,880
 I can do. I am doing a panel called DNA is Just a Code, which is about genetics,

340
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,160
 so, hey, I like genetics. I'm doing con running in age of COVID-19, which would be interesting,

341
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,840
 so I will talk about punctuation. I will probably talk about, you know,

342
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,920
 Eastercons and Worldcons and all the stuff that we have been talking about for two and a half years,

343
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:35,200
 whenever there's a lot of other topics of conversation. I'm running a in-person

344
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,480
 convention tour, so if you are new to Ch icon, you can come along on Friday and I will show you

345
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,520
 how conventions are organized in person. And I'm doing a panel called Everything I Know,

346
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,080
 I Learned From Fandom, because everything I know I learned from fandom. Okay. Cool. That sounds like

347
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,000
 a good mix of panels, a good mix of like, fanish stuff and your professional expertise as well,

348
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,680
 which I think is always nice. Yeah, I mean, I did massively foggyed up by

349
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,280
 warning to future people. I set my number of items too low and didn't really think about the fact

350
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,640
 that I was thinking I don't want to prep too many panels, because that'd be like, I don't want to

351
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,080
 have too much pre-prept to do without thinking that actually I'm doing like a crochet circle where

352
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,240
 you just come along and like, knit for the day and that requires no prep whatsoever. So I pushed

353
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,480
 you back up again and they put me on a science panel. This word prep. Yeah. I'm going to think

354
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,480
 about things that I say on panels. Yeah, I know. Is this a foreign concept, Alison? I always prep

355
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,640
 for panels. Yes, I know, guys. You probably also prep for the podcast, don't you? Alison, what are

356
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,720
 you doing? I am on. On Thursday, I am doing fan funds from what we'll list to today along with

357
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,760
 fear as a TAF delegate and Joseph Clary of Phallak, who's also one of the guests of honor of the

358
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,040
 convention. I am on an air meet on a virtual panel on, so this is your first Worldcon,

359
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,960
 where hopefully I will be able to sing the praises of virtual Worldcons and I'm definitely going to

360
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,840
 have a ribbon for the people who turned up to that. So a virtual ribbon. So I need to do some

361
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,320
 virtual ribbons for this convention, which haven't started yet because, oh God, right, I am on a

362
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,480
 panel called Build Your Pug Cuff Community. I am on a panel and I believe I might be moderating a

363
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,520
 panel called Organizing a Good Fan Lounge, where people I guess get to tell me how I haven't done

364
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,160
 that due to not having actually done all the organization yesterday, it's only two weeks ago.

365
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,800
 So do come along to that. I am one of many people helping out with the fan funds auction on the

366
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:37,440
 Saturday. And on Monday, I've got a panel called Fan Clubs in the 21st century and beyond, which I

367
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,560
 do have to do some prep for actually, because I'm not at all sure what I'm going to say on that one.

368
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:47,120
 Well, you're moderating it, aren't you? I still need to do some prep. Even more prep if I'm...

369
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,720
 Yeah, but moderating is easier than being on, right? Because you have to know the questions

370
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,320
 more than you have to know the answers. But this is the panel that I can't really tell

371
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,520
 what much about it because it scrolls off the bottom of my screen on my iPad, so I can't actually

372
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,360
 find out about it, because there's a slight bugging planer over, which I need to tell them about at

373
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,280
 some point. But at some point I'll turn my iPad round and find out more about that.

374
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:20,480
 Bug, Alison could not be bothered to turn the iPad around. So I feel like that's a good bunch.

375
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,120
 It didn't feel like too much. And apparently I'm having a lot of breakfast with people and going

376
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,840
 on boat trips and eating dinners and finding some bars and running the fan lounge. My schedule,

377
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,720
 I have living on space stations on Thursday where I'll be talking with my science hat on,

378
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,920
 and basically being like, "Ready, yeah, sure." I will be on a panel called Building

379
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:54,400
 Fandom Events, Myth's versus Reality, where I'll be talking about perceptions of how fan events

380
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,680
 are built and run that don't match reality. So that'll be fun. I'm moderating a panel called

381
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:05,280
 Starting Your Own Podcast, and I'm glad I'm moderating that, because hopefully I can make the questions

382
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,880
 more interesting than what microphone do you buy, which is often the pitfall with that kind of

383
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,840
 panel. And then I'm also on the Star Wars panel, Star Wars controller of the universe,

384
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,680
 and that will be very good, and will probably be quite busy. It's in a ballroom, so that's fun.

385
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:28,240
 And I am not on any virtual panels. I am entirely in person. So yeah, come see us listeners,

386
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,560
 or don't. One thing about the fanzine lounge that we do need to squeeze in to our remaining

387
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,720
 five minutes, which is that the WELCOME appa will be happening, the WOOF, which stands for

388
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,240
 something like the WELCOME order of fan editors, but I don't quite understand how it works, but

389
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,360
 what that means is you can be part of a physical and virtual collation of small fanzines, and all

390
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,480
 the details are in file 770. Chris Gossia is going to put it together. No dead friend of this podcast,

391
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,360
 I think we can say. And all the details are in a file so I have a link that we will put in the

392
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:10,320
 show notes, but basically you bring your appa-zine to the WELCOME and it gets bound into a physical

393
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,400
 or virtual product for the contributors to take away and for other people to read online. So,

394
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,240
 very exciting. And I will definitely, definitely have a WOOF scene ready. I'm going to have a

395
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,560
 WOOF scene ready. The WOOF scene is going to be my trip before from Orlando. You heard it here,

396
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,440
 first listeners. Well done. Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of, you know, if nothing else, it's going to be

397
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,080
 impressions of my first three days in America. I'm just going to print out in the fanzine lounge

398
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,560
 or virtual that'll be fine. I haven't asked Alison. It'll be fine. We might be charging you,

399
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,160
 but not very much. We might be working out what the actual cost of paper at Odera is

400
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,200
 and charging you that. Can I pay in winning smiles? I mean, that's what we pay you for editing

401
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,960
 the podcast. So, yes, but you won't like it because I'll give you a schedule. Oh, no.

402
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,520
 We meant need to do we need to mention an electronic selection? No. Okay. Well, because there's not much

403
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:20,000
 to say, right? It just works. It's good. More of this, please, WOOF us. If you were wondering why

404
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,480
 the discussions on electronic site selection had gone quiet, it's because they just done it and

405
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,640
 implemented it and it works and it's amazing and it's very quick and it works really well.

406
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,480
 And it's still a secret ballot. And I feel like it's like they could have done this at any time,

407
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,520
 but they had to wait until it was funny. Well, it turns out that whenever we are told that

408
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,000
 something to do with WOOF us would be very difficult to do electronically and it's very hard.

409
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,640
 When they dry it turns out it's actually super easy and there's no problem. Who knew?

410
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,720
 Hara. Like, pics. Was that the shortest chapter in Octa-Thought history, right in listeners?

411
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:04,960
 Just before we move on from Worldcon, we do know that Uganda is bidding Worldcon. It is very

412
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,680
 exciting. We will be talking about it after we get back from Tricon and we have met them and

413
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:17,120
 visited their fan table on all of those glorious things. But for now, hurrah. And more nuanced

414
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,480
 thought next time or the time after. Yeah. All right.

415
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,480
 [Music]

416
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,760
 Pics. Well, that's not really told there are pics. You should tell you, tell us why you liked it.

417
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,320
 Should I tell you why? So I've read the first line of Sarah Pinska's

418
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,880
 Where Oaken Hearts Do Gather, which I had plunged on because I thought it might be the sort of

419
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,920
 thing I would like. And the first line says something like, "Where Oaken Hearts Do Gather is

420
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:57,600
 is an English traditional folk ballad child 315 round number 423." And I went, "The hell it is."

421
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,640
 Which I think is not necessarily what Sarah Pinska intended. But after that, I was like,

422
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:10,800
 "Oh, this is amazing." She tells the story in the form of argumentative commenters in a

423
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,280
 discussion board that is a thinly veiled version of genius.com. And my goodness, she has worked hard.

424
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,200
 She gets the form right. Although the ballad is obviously made up, she actually picks a lot of

425
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,880
 themes that do occur in traditional ballads. And she wraps them together in a way that doesn't.

426
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,200
 She talks extremely knowledgeably about the way that pop groups take English ballads and work with

427
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,240
 them and border ballads and work with them. And the way in which ballads move across the Atlantic

428
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,240
 and into different countries and the people she has, populating her message board,

429
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:56,240
 are very realistic. And the actual story that is told indirectly through this is amazing. And I

430
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,200
 was so glad that I had this story there to put top of my ballad. I was just absolutely thrilled by

431
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,680
 every part of it. And there is one line in the middle of it, which actually caused me to fall

432
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,800
 about on the floor laughing, which was quite difficult because I was listening to music at the time

433
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,000
 to festival. And you're not supposed to suddenly roll around on the floor laughing in the middle

434
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,520
 of a festival. People think you're on drugs, which I was, but only a very good story. It's fantastic.

435
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,640
 And then I said that to a couple of people and they were like, "Yeah, I voted for it too,

436
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:34,640
 Alison. You should read your, you go pick, pack it earlier next year." Loved it. It won the

437
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,520
 Nebula Award for Best Short Story. It, I think, was quite well received by the Nebula readership.

438
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,440
 And I think it might do very well in the Hugo readership as well. And I liked it very much.

439
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,200
 I thought it was very good. And I liked kind of seeing how it unfolded. And yeah, it was good.

440
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,360
 And there's an interview in the Hugo packet. There's an interview with her that starts by her going,

441
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,720
 "I did a ton of research for this short story." And I'm like, "And that shows because one of my

442
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,040
 pals said, 'I knew you might like this, but I wasn't sure if you would, because I thought you

443
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,560
 might be going, 'Oh, it gets these things really wrong.' And it just worked really hard. It's a

444
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,920
 great story. Because I do know a lot about ballads." Liz, do you want to do your pick?

445
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,640
 I'm going next. So my pick is basically, I've spent all my time reading Hugo books

446
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,480
 I'm looking about with the Hugo schedule and preparing for holiday. So my pick is the only

447
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,400
 film I've watched, which is vaguely science fictional witches I watch. Dr Strange in the

448
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,960
 multiverse of madness. And actually it's quite good. It's quite fun. I mean, it's not like the top

449
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:45,040
 of the heap for Marvel movies, but it has a great soundtrack. It has great battle and fight scenes.

450
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,720
 And I really like how the kind of different witchcraft versus spellcraft and different styles of Dr

451
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,600
 Strange versus wong and so on are all in there. It introduces America Chavez, who is great and

452
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,160
 punches holes between universes. And that means we also might get young Avengers at some point,

453
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,800
 and that would be good. And I mean, lastly, it's got a really good Danny Elfman soundtrack as well.

454
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,320
 Basically, if what you're always wanting in a Marvel movie is for there to be more zombies

455
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,400
 possessed by their parallel universe doppelgangers who take the souls of the dead and turn the

456
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,240
 mentor cloak, then you should watch Dr Strange in the multiverse of madness.

457
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,360
 I liked it a lot. It is very much a Sam Raimi movie. Yeah, it's very Sam Raimi.

458
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,600
 It's weird because it's very tied into the MTU in some ways, but in other ways, it feels very much

459
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,760
 like a movie by the person what done it. And I did very much appreciate that. Up to and including

460
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,280
 the inevitable Bruce Campbell cameo, which was very good. But yeah, no, I also enjoyed it. I

461
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,040
 don't think, yeah, like you said, it's not the top of the pile for me, but I did think it was good.

462
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,680
 There's a good episode of the incomparable that talks about it in some detail, which I really

463
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,520
 found interesting, and I will put a link to that in the show notes listeners.

464
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:05,840
 So I'm gonna pick two things because I am some sort of a wanker. John. Mainly because I want to

465
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,240
 pick one which is like Addison's and one which is like Lizzie's. So the first one I'll pick,

466
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,560
 I'll go for the one like Lizzie's first. Yesterday my wife and I went to go and see Nope.

467
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,360
 And Nope is very good. It is a Jordan Peel film. Jordan Peel is very good.

468
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,800
 Basically everything he's done is great. You should go and watch it all.

469
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,880
 Nope is, I really, really, really enjoyed it. I thought it was just, it's very good, very,

470
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,000
 very tight. Everything that happens has something to do with everything else that happens,

471
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,960
 which is what movies should be about. And that is nice. Much in the same way that like there are

472
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:49,120
 not many dangling elements in get out or in us, both of which are among the movies in the streaming

473
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,360
 era that I've actually bought rather than just being like, "Oh they'll be on streaming."

474
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,280
 Because I'm like, they're amazing. It's not as good as Get Out. Get Out is still, I think,

475
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,120
 his best film. But where Get Out is a five out of five film, I think Nope is probably a four and a half.

476
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:09,280
 So yes, very much enjoyed it. One of my other's pals said, "Watch it really soon,

477
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,360
 like straight away because otherwise people are going to spoil it for you."

478
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,960
 So I am wondering about going to the cinema in my copious free time this week.

479
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,080
 Nice. Which I don't have. But actually it's very hot. So if we went like in the middle of the day

480
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,320
 on a very hot day, that might be quite nice. Yeah, we went yesterday. That's why I've seen a lot

481
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,480
 of random films. Yep. Well, we went yesterday for two reasons, which is firstly very hot,

482
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,440
 and it was cooler in the middle of the day. And secondly, we're members of our local cinema

483
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,560
 and our local cinema has a summer cinema deal on anyway. So between the deal and the discount,

484
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,160
 we paid nine quid for two cinema tickets and that was good. The other pick I have is like

485
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:53,120
 Alison's pick, except that it will be eligible for Hugo at Chengdu. And it is Family Cooking by

486
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:01,280
 Anna Maria Curtis, which is a short story, clocking in at 4151 words. Brief digression.

487
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,600
 Do wish they'd put the word counts in the ePubs of uncanny instead of just on the website,

488
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,880
 because it does frustrate me that I have to cross reference with the website to find out

489
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,040
 whether it's a short story or not. But it was so good. I loved it. I really just

490
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,200
 I like the themes it plays with. I like the kind of world building and the magic in it.

491
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,840
 I just really, really liked it. Listeners, it is 4,000 words, so it won't take long to read.

492
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,840
 I highly recommend it to everyone, especially if you've ever disliked your grandparents.

493
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,760
 That was the Old Thought Podcast, and it's goodbye from me.

494
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,760
 It's goodbye from me. And goodbye from me. Hey.

495
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:59,920
 [Music]

496
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,280
 Chris also says he remembers when Koto came out and thinking it was really good, but also

497
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,320
 realizing that he loved Dark Forces far more as a game. I'd say a controversial thing,

498
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,920
 which is in general, I believe Star Wars games that do not involve Jedi are far superior to Star

499
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:23,360
 Wars games that do. Right? And if you disagree. So you know the X-Wing game? Does that involve Jedi?

500
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,280
 Oh, I see what you mean. Like does it still count if there is a Jedi piloting the X-Wing,

501
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,520
 but otherwise their Jediness is not commented on? Yeah. I think probably not. I mean games without

502
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,320
 like Jedi powers and light savers, because like Rogue Squadron, I would count as a game without

503
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,160
 Jedi. I'm pretty sure you play as Luke Skywalker, but like you don't actually use the Force in any

504
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:49,360
 meaningful sense. That, yeah, that's fair. I hear you talk about Star Wars games, and I keep thinking

505
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,800
 about Wing Commander, which was technically not a Star Wars game, because it didn't have the IP,

506
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,880
 but it was a Star Wars game totally, and also that arcade game where you had to, which was

507
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,160
 vector graphics, and you had to fly around a load of laser towers. I feel very old now. I'll just

508
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,280
 get my stick. I'll be over here with my Coco and my Zimmer frame. Yeah, I've just do good Wing

509
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,400
 Commander and my God. Oh, it was amazing. That is an old game. Oh yeah. Oh God, and Star Wars arcade

510
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,560
 game. Oh, it was so fantastic. So I was okay. Game was very good. Uh, I think, uh, Rogue Squadron,

511
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,320
 Episode 1 Racer, Battlefront, are all good examples of, uh, Dark Force is actually,

512
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,600
 and Jedi Knight 2 before you get the lightsaber is way better than Jedi Knight 2 after you get

513
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,520
 the lightsaber much better as a shooter than it is as a lightsaber simulator. I feel like if you

514
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,320
 want to play lightsaber games, you know, want a set of goggles, don't you? It's because they're

515
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:52,560
 much better with goggles than they are with that goggles. No, actually, slightly discreet there,

516
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,920
 because most of lightsaber fighting is to do with, uh, resistivity and until they come up with a VR

517
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,240
 game that can like physically prevent you just passing your lightsaber through anything, uh, they're

518
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,960
 all just not very good. Um, uh, I think the best- Yeah, no, they do that. Well, there's no, there's no

519
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,760
 like mechanical thing in the gloves that stops you. Like, if I'm holding a lightsaber, someone else

520
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,320
 has a lightsaber, I can't move my hands that way in VR. I can. Um, so it doesn't work. Oh, yeah. But

521
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,600
 Fallen Order does a very, very good job of making you feel like a Jedi, mostly because it has a very

522
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:29,520
 good, uh, um, manifestation of the powers, uh, very good combat system, in my opinion.

523
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,880
 Are we using our precious 38 minutes to talk about, um, some of those video games?

524
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,040
 Mark Plummer will write it. The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin McLeod
