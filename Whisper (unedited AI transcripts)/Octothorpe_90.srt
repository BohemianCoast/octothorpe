1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 Yeah, it would have been good if I could have remembered what the blurb was.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,760
 It was a book, right?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,480
 Six clones, locked room, murder, they've all been killed, blah blah blah.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,480
 Read, go and read the Goodreads page.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,040
 Hello everyone and welcome to a special book club episode of Octa Thorpe, the podcast for

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,440
 science fiction and science fiction fandom. I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,040
 and today we have read a book. Have you finished the book, Liz? Yes.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,440
 We have all read the book. I'm good, I've done my homework. I read it yesterday and Liz read it

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,800
 yesterday and the day before. Yes. And Alison read it a couple of weeks ago, I think.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,400
 Months ago I can't remember anything about it. I'm sure I made some notes.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,840
 Aye. So the book we read was a book called Six Weeks by Merlafferty.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:14,880
 This was on the Hugo Ballot at the San Jose Worldcon in 2018 and I believe it lost out to one of the

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,520
 NK Gemmerson trilogy but I can't remember exactly which instalment which is, you know,

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,080
 if you're not going to win a Hugo, not winning a Hugo in favor of NK Gemmerson is not a bad one

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,040
 to lose to. And yes, I liked it when I read it back then and so I've taken the opportunity to

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:39,200
 make Alison and Liz read it. So Six Weeks is a book about a generation ship or not quite a

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,560
 generation ship but a sort of colony ship that has been launched from Earth and is heading to

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:53,600
 a planet to colonize it and it follows six people on the ship who are the crew and the novel opens

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,880
 with basically these six people coming awake from cryo sleep from their last mind map which is

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,360
 their last kind of memory backup which was taken just as they boarded the ship and slowly realizing

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,880
 that perhaps everything might have gone incredibly wrong at some point and no one really quite knows

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,560
 why. And so it's in some ways a kind of locked room mystery set on a spaceship in which the

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
 murder victims and the investigators are the same people. Have I missed anything out? Do you think

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,720
 Liz? No, I think that is fair to me. It is basically a locked room mystery although I'm sure there are

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,000
 mystery fans bigger than us who were writing on tellers if this is actually a locked room mystery.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,680
 I don't know if it actually is because a locked room mystery the idea is that it's kind of

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,480
 impossible and you have to work out what impossible thing has been breached where this is I think

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,320
 lesser locked room mystery as much as a interesting murder mystery where the people investigating it

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,280
 are the people themselves who have been murdered which is a particularly nice like science fictional

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,560
 twist. It's not just that they're investigating their own murders but they also know that

31
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,760
 one of them must be the murderer and because none of them remember none of them like no whether they

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,120
 were or not so that is kind of another wrinkle in the ointment which is quite nice. I don't know

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,880
 whether we want to start with Alison and then Liz or or vice versa but I'm up for either. Rather

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,200
 than you because you made us read it so I know I would I think we should start with maybe John

35
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,200
 explaining a little bit more about why I picked it would be nice. Okay, fair enough I could do that.

36
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,760
 So this is something Liz mentioned when when we were kind of describing the kind of core setup of

37
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,920
 the novel but one of the things I really like about this novel is that I think it's a story you

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,600
 couldn't tell if you didn't use both of the genres it matches up. Like I don't think you could tell

39
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,760
 this story in a pure crime setting and I don't think you could tell it in a purely SF setting. I

40
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,440
 think you need tropes from both genres and I really like that the way that Lafferty blends those

41
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,920
 together and I thought it was I mean as someone who likes crime fiction anyway um that really

42
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,080
 appealed to me for obvious reasons and I also liked how I don't think I don't think it's impossible

43
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,720
 to see the twists and turns coming if you're paying attention and I suspect that I suspect that Liz

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,920
 and Alison might both have seen various of the kind of revelations coming over the course of the novel

45
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,000
 but I really like how tight the book is if something is mentioned it's usually because it's going to

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,800
 come back later in the novel and be a key point and even parts where I didn't remember how it came

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,360
 back in on the reread I was pleased to see the threads kind of being marshalled back together at

48
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:49,520
 the end which I did really enjoy. I also very much found the characters kind of compelling I've

49
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,800
 always liked I've read most other work and it's fair to say I like the shambling guide to New

50
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
 York City and it's sequel better than I like her other stuff but one of the things I quite like

51
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,200
 is kind of like her sense of humor and her sort of um approached character both of which I thought

52
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,160
 were very good in this book. Since this book she's written another crime science fiction novel which

53
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,000
 I was less impressed by it was it was good but it was very much it was much lighter and much less

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,520
 well done than this one. Yeah I like this a lot. I guess the other thing I like is the way she

55
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,800
 layers the revelations is also interesting because you find out quite early on I think that things

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,760
 are not as disconnected as they seem but the connections keep being layered on and so that kind

57
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,040
 of makes it interesting as well because even if you think you've spotted a connection I was never

58
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,720
 sure like I've spotted a connection but is that going to be the final piece of that puzzle or is

59
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,520
 there going to be more to reveal later and that that was cool. And then the main reason I love it

60
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,560
 is just because of the premise I think the premise of six clones having to investigate their own

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,520
 murders on a spaceship is just a friggin wonderful idea and that you know I went through the entire

62
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:07,200
 book on a cloud of kind of ah this is great. So I was very I was very um well disposed to it going

63
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,240
 in I think it is fair to say when I first read it. That is quite interesting because I think I

64
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,640
 agree with John that there is a great premise for this book but I didn't think it was it I don't

65
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,440
 think it actually is a great book. Fair enough. But it's interesting because I think some of the

66
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,160
 reasons John likes it are also the reasons I don't like it in in some ways. I mean a bit

67
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,280
 harsh I didn't like super dislike it I just think if I'd read it on a Hugo ballot I definitely would

68
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,160
 have you know put the NK jemisin above it and it was enjoyable enough but I'm not sure it's one I

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,440
 would have picked to recommend. Yeah some of things John likes I think are the reasons I don't like

70
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,320
 it. So one thing is I think you're right in that it needs to be like the mystery and the science

71
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,120
 fiction to get where it's going and it has to be science fiction to do this fascinating the clones

72
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,360
 wake up and are investigating the murder of their previous bodies but I didn't find the mystery at

73
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,480
 the end very satisfying. I didn't feel it kind of paced itself quite right for me. I think that

74
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,440
 there's quite a few revelations that come near the end that are too close to the end and a bit too

75
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,880
 much maybe it's not exactly bagginess at the early stages but laying the seeds for things that come

76
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,040
 back later but there's too much laying of seeds and then you're like okay well you keep mentioning

77
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,240
 this so when is this going to come back to being the super important thing and so that kind of pacing

78
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,360
 didn't really work for me as as well as it should have and I get you kind of want to have like a

79
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,760
 very big dynamic reveal at the end but I think it went almost too fast with the revelation of a

80
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,600
 oh that's how it was done and then it goes into kind of a I'm trying to work out if I can do

81
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,000
 it without doing enormous spoilers. I think maybe I'll try and do some without spoilers and then

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,360
 we'll have to have a listeners stop here if you don't want spoilers section. It basically goes into

83
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,480
 the end scene which I found a little bit there's like a kind of end climax which was a bit too

84
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,560
 much stuff going on and too confusing and then it kind of ties itself all up. So I just felt like

85
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,680
 the structure and the pacing after kind of the initial really interesting first bit didn't work

86
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,400
 for me throughout. Yes so I'm going to start as always with something which I absolutely loved

87
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,720
 about this book which is that it turns out to be a piece of FTL fan fiction. I mean in the

88
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:31,280
 afterward Merlafter says it's not a piece of FTL fan fiction but it arose out of consideration

89
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,560
 of how FTL's clone bay mechanism would play out in real life and as somebody who's played really

90
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,400
 far more FTL than is good for me I really like that so so I thought that was a very good example of

91
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:51,200
 art inspiring other art in a really interesting way and she could perfectly well not have mentioned

92
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,800
 it and sold the book you know it's not actually FTL fan fiction it's not otherwise like FTL at

93
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,640
 all I don't think it's just that one point about FTL's slightly nonsensey clone bays and what that

94
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,520
 might look like in a book. I will tell the listener FTL is a roguelike video game it was released

95
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,360
 oh few years ago now it stands for Fast and Light obviously it's available on multiple platforms

96
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:24,000
 basically the idea is you are on a ship and you fly through a sequence of points in a galaxy

97
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,520
 trying to get from where you started to defeating an evil empire. The plot isn't really the key part

98
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,400
 it's a very fun game apparently came out in 2012 so it is 11 years old now which is you know

99
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,600
 terrifying. Ancient in video game terms but it's okay because it turns out they did make good video

100
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,120
 games in the past. It mashes up crime fiction and science fiction so crime fiction for me and

101
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,920
 I'm not a great crime fiction fan so I may be getting this wrong tends to have stuff that is

102
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,120
 more what I think of as detective and mystery novels and stuff that is more sort of thrillers

103
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,240
 and this thinks it's a detective novel but it's actually a thriller and there's a couple of

104
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,520
 reasons for that the first is that it's got a lot of absolutely horrible stuff in it I described

105
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,600
 this as a slasher thing there's a lot of the action that takes place in in real life is actually

106
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,240
 people whacking each other with swords and things so you know if you don't like that sort of thing

107
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,080
 this might not be the novel for you but the other way in which it's more thriller like

108
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,680
 than detective like is that the information you would need to solve the mystery is deliberately

109
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,280
 withheld from you and in fact it has to be deliberately withheld from you because if any more of it

110
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,000
 were revealed you would immediately guess what was going on even more than you already do

111
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,360
 so it doesn't really it doesn't really function on the detective or it didn't for me function as a

112
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,280
 detective story it functioned us so although you've got these people trying to work out what's happened

113
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,480
 to them it felt as for me as if it was much more over to the thriller or horror side than it was

114
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,240
 over the detective side mystery side and so because in so far as I do like crime fiction I like

115
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,280
 the sort of cozy detective novel where sweet little old ladies go and go and um investigate

116
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,080
 horrible murders without actually ever getting terribly close to them it was that bit doesn't

117
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,920
 work maybe as well for me as it might have done did like the science fiction bits of it quite a

118
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,760
 lot though yeah so that was that was so I think I said in a previous octa thought record might have

119
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,360
 fallen out in the edit um it was it was a bit nasty for me it's a bit over to the horror side for me

120
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,000
 there were scenes I was kind of like oh and in fact I said I couldn't remember how I'd read this but

121
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,680
 in fact what happened was that I started it it felt a bit horrible I put it down for a bit but

122
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,680
 that I was like oh I have to read it for octa thought picked it up and then read it all the way through

123
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,720
 in a single lump because I did find it quite gripping so so it was a it was a grippy novel I

124
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,760
 read it I thought it was an easy read and I read it all very happily after the first few bits apart

125
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,480
 from every so often I said you that's horrible yeah so I think that I think you're right I don't

126
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:08,160
 think you can um work out what's going on from the beginning but obviously it's tricky because

127
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,080
 that it's basically the science fiction equivalent of the amnesiac um thing right where like they

128
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,360
 don't have the memories or the logs and so I wonder whether that's kind of shadowing what happens to

129
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,280
 the characters so I didn't it kind of felt like you have as much information as the as the characters

130
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,240
 do at any point or maybe not entirely obviously if you had all the information that every character

131
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,280
 has you'd know the answer but because there's no way for I guess Mercado did it from a single

132
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,960
 viewpoint and given you all the information about one character and none of it about the others

133
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,720
 but I thought this struck a good balance between kind of keeping you as in the dark to a similar

134
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,680
 level the characters are so I completely think you're right but I think that worked for me better

135
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,960
 than it worked for you probably I will I will say I also when I reread this I blasted through it I

136
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,520
 read it in a single sitting under a cat which is very good so so I thought the authorial voice

137
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,640
 was a bit of a mess this is one of these technical details because the way that you do that is have

138
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:13,520
 separate sections from each character's viewpoint but in a way that has the character narrating

139
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,680
 and what we actually got was omniscience where we have a an authorial voice that is omniscient but

140
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,000
 actually doesn't tell us things if it doesn't suit it and that's a bit old. So I feel like that

141
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,840
 was an editorial choice and there are a few things about this book where I think ooh editing

142
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,480
 ooh maybe the editing could have been a bit more rigorous and that may be part of the issue why

143
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:46,080
 it didn't I don't think it found a UK publisher ever for what is oh I think a perfectly solid book

144
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,240
 yeah no it didn't I don't know I mean I pass I know what you mean I think I do wonder whether

145
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,480
 in the beginning of the book the first couple of chapters like until I got into the zone of the

146
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,320
 novel I think like there are the odd character perspective shift that like slightly caught me by

147
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,560
 surprise and so I do know what you mean that like maybe better clearer delineations might have been

148
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,440
 good so yeah I can see that I'm a big fan of unreliable narrators but I don't know if that's

149
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,920
 what she's trying to do I don't really think she is yeah I don't think you can have seven of them

150
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,720
 anyway or six of them or however many there are I think that is too that is asking a lot of your

151
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,920
 reader I always say so I guess we should sound the spoiler klaxon quite soon yes is there anything

152
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,320
 else we want to say without spoiling this novel so I don't know so this is not really a spoiler but

153
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,280
 I will say it's something that colored my view of the book which is that if you currently buy it off

154
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:50,480
 a UK Amazon Kindle store it has a bunch of formatting errors and I realize yeah it doesn't

155
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,960
 have her it doesn't have a British publisher so she self published it yeah and I realized that

156
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,360
 when I got to the end and it says you know you can you can write to the author with errors so I may

157
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,680
 do that but the the errors specifically are line breaks in the wrong places so in the middle of

158
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,480
 paragraphs and not between different characters speaking and so that has probably colored some

159
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,920
 of my opinion of the book because they are unfortunately it's in the edition I'm reading

160
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,520
 there are throughout kind of errors in the formatting that make it kind of hard to

161
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,720
 kind of spot which character is talking at times it actually has character shifts in the middle of

162
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,520
 paragraphs as a result of this but I think I caught on fairly quickly that this was actually a formatting

163
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:44,400
 fault rather than a deliberate authorial choice and once I got used to it I recognized when they

164
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:51,040
 happened but that yeah that that does make it harder yes so I mean it's this is not it's not

165
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,160
 really coming into a spoilery territory I guess but what I would say is one problem I had with the book

166
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,640
 is I think the character's voices sound pretty similar and so the fact that occasionally their

167
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,680
 conversations were all running into one line and I had to go back and reread it to make sure I

168
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,960
 knew exactly who was saying what line that did not unfortunately help the experience of reading

169
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,240
 it but I recognize that is a formatting that like is a formatting error and you know it's

170
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,160
 I presume that has crept in at some point with a Kindle update but it was causing me a few

171
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,920
 problems when I read it so I can't really kind of disentangle that from the reading experience

172
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,800
 unfortunately I read it in paper because I imported it I bought it from Blackwell's when it was nominated

173
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,960
 the first time because it wasn't in the packet if I recall correctly so I bought the paper version

174
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,840
 from from Blackwell's so I did not have I did not have that experience but yes that sounds annoying

175
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,920
 I mean this is a regular criticism of books that have a lot of different viewpoints okay still not

176
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,280
 too spoilery not everyone on the ship is who you are initially led to expect them to be or acting

177
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,800
 in accordance with the motives they initially say they're going to have I don't think that's

178
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,720
 something that's particularly unusual this is one of the ways in which I think science fictionally

179
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,760
 the book was quite good in fact it did some things in quite a clever way around the the nature of

180
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,080
 self and what indeed is meant by cloning and all of that stuff and some of the ways in which

181
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:29,840
 everything gets tied up together is jolly good but but that does lead to this you probably wanted

182
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,840
 more distinct voices than you got but I understand that I'm not I'm not a writer and I don't know how

183
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,480
 hard it would have been to to write those voices I I can't because I can only write in one voice right

184
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:51,440
 guys I can I'm I'm resolutely Allison all the time that is that is definitely true just think

185
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,920
 case any listeners were wondering yes agreed if I write if I write a novel people will complain

186
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,280
 that all the characters are a bit like me but it is I can see it being like a coherent critique

187
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:12,080
 shall we sound the spoiler horn

188
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,440
 so yeah so one of the things I think the other thing I really like about this book and I like this

189
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:29,920
 in general in fiction and it probably says a lot about me that I do like it is that I really like

190
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,320
 books that can have happy endings which don't feel like just they're out of nowhere like the happy

191
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,600
 ending in this book is well telegraphed in advance with the pig and I really like that because I

192
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,040
 think if you're paying attention you can probably work out that the fact that they can cook a pig

193
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,240
 means they can probably recreate the humans but I have a note here which is check-offs food printer

194
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:03,520
 why is maria cooking a pig the plot demands it if you had if you had a 3d printer so so this bit

195
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:11,680
 that John liked is something that I thought was fucking stupid oh no okay you know absolutely

196
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:18,000
 appalling and and and I was like why can we clone humans but not vegetables that's insane that's

197
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,760
 absolutely ludicrous and then it turns out that they can clone vegetables perfectly provided its

198
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,800
 hemlock oh well done guys I think um I think they say they can is just not as good which I assumed

199
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,840
 was because life was protein and vegetables are not made of protein but I don't know because most

200
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,440
 of the world effort in 3 printing food at the moment is very focused on meat and protein and I

201
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,800
 don't know how that will change in the future where's the money follow the money well exactly

202
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,400
 right when also follow the climate change because I can see why in general cows are worse for the

203
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,040
 environment than this is this is something I know that there's debate on and I want to present

204
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,160
 this as like a fact necessarily but I know that like one of the reasons there's a lot more research

205
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,120
 into 3d printing meat is because its thought the meat is worse for the environment than the crops

206
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,160
 and so like I don't know I mean yeah it's tricky no I think it's where the money is because meat's

207
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:20,000
 vastly more expensive than vegetables so if you can if you can make meat you can sell it to people

208
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,920
 for more money than you're going to be able to sell vegetables for and but also you are correct

209
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,600
 that the demand is probably there because people want to remove meat from their diet first this

210
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:37,040
 is a digression but all to say did you think this book had a happy ending yes I did why

211
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:45,440
 because it does for whom for Sally no although I did Liz what do you think of the ending I mean

212
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,880
 I think it's potentially a happy ending but you know what we know what we know from the book

213
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,080
 listeners is that instead of this being a crew perfectly picked to psychologically balance each

214
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,040
 other out over the immensely long space journey is a bunch of people picked to be the worst possible

215
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,880
 companions on a space journey I had Eastcon flashbacks all the way through this I think your

216
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,920
 happy ending is predicated on them now having gone through this experience and being like now we

217
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,440
 are going to get the long fine and it's great rather than it being okay in 25 years they will all

218
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,520
 also have stabbed each other to death again also from my notes why is the AI program to return to

219
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,520
 earth if this entire mission is designed to sabotage what makes anyone think there's a planet at the

220
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,880
 other end what on earth makes that plausible the more effective sabotage would be to have way less

221
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,200
 synthesis since this goo on the ship the necessary to reach landfall and indeed no landfall to reach

222
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,600
 I think I'm just a nihilist in terms of my science fiction I think the argument might be that an

223
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,240
 eternity of never getting anywhere is worse punishment than a shorter eternity and so there's loads of

224
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,320
 synth goo because she really wants to drag it out but basically listeners it turns out that as Liz

225
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,680
 says all of these people have been very carefully selected they are all enemies of a character we

226
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:13,760
 meet quite earlier in the book called Sally Minon who is an certified rotter and this is the answer

227
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,320
 this mission is the answer to the question how do you get revenge on your enemies if death doesn't

228
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,960
 matter and the answer is you fire them off the earth and force them to spend untold years in a

229
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,920
 small tin can which is it's an imaginative answer to the question yeah so the thousands of people

230
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,640
 in cryo sleep are also Sally's enemies because she's one of these super rich people who has a

231
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,000
 lot of enemy enemies and they're just going to die quietly so I thought that was kind of interesting

232
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,760
 as well yeah yeah because she's not actually giving them a terrible death she's only picked these

233
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,720
 six characters for the terrible death yes I will also say in some ways so we discussed how it's

234
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,840
 see it was inspired by a 2012 work which is a FTL in that it was like based on FTS musings about

235
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,160
 how cloning would work in a science fiction novel I also wonder if it was partly inspired by another

236
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:17,040
 2012 work which is the Ridley Scott film Prometheus because Prometheus is a film where it purports that

237
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,600
 the crew are very carefully selected to work well together and then portrays an utterly incompetent

238
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,280
 mess of idiots and I'm like maybe this is maybe this is MERS take on that because there are

239
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,000
 points where I'm like yeah this does feel very much like the crew of Prometheus in terms of

240
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,520
 their ability to work well together but yes maybe I don't know so so will the crew of Prometheus

241
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,120
 deliberately chosen not to work well together or no it's said in the movie that they're carefully

242
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,600
 selected to be like an elite team and then nothing in the text of the movie at all in order for the

243
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,800
 movie to go they all have to be utter imbeciles you argue all the time and like the film just tells

244
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,200
 you these are the people at the top of their field and they're all going to work very well

245
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,320
 together and then nothing in the text of the movie it's been like Ted in How I Met Your Mother

246
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,200
 everyone in How I Met Your Mother repeatedly says Ted is the best bloke but he is a stone cold

247
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,680
 asshole from episode one to the last episode and it's really there's a huge cognitive dissonance

248
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,280
 and I like fiction where that's true and this feels like a book where she's using that trope

249
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,040
 she's using the fact that very often we are told these characters will work well together

250
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,600
 and then the writing really doesn't reflect that but she's doing it on purpose to sort of

251
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,320
 play with her expectations a little bit which I do I did quite like that aspect of things

252
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,760
 yeah I did like that I did like all the stuff about them well not being themselves all the

253
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,120
 fucking around that had been done with their brains at various different times in various

254
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,160
 different ways and the way in which she came across she looked at that from multiple different

255
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,440
 angles and that was all great so the science fictiony bits of it really liked this I really

256
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,840
 like the science fictiony concepts but in practice in the book the science fictiony concepts feel like

257
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,000
 you know one character is one of those like genius hackers who types away and all the

258
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,880
 text goes green and then they figure it out it just relies on me to think that someone can

259
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,280
 basically instantly look at some kind of computerized map of a human brain and perfectly isolate a

260
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:26,160
 single trait and remove it and on with their DNA there was some there was some slightly wobbly

261
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:35,280
 stuff there it just it was it was much too easy a lot of the time to do the very precise hacking

262
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,600
 yeah we're not we're not necessarily shown that we have done the spoiler warning that we're not

263
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:47,200
 necessarily shown well enough why Maria is that person yeah we never see a no we we're told she

264
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,840
 has the background but we we do see it to her doing it a bit with a food printer but maybe not

265
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,560
 enough and maybe her not noticing that the food printer is exactly the same replicator as the

266
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:05,200
 cloning bay is is implausible that's a thing that we've not been told and when she makes that

267
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,720
 but when she realizes that you're kind of like well surely if you're the character you've

268
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,280
 been described as being you would instantly have realized that I mean surely if you have

269
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,240
 a food printer that can actually essentially grow people a new body and put their brain into

270
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:27,520
 it it could also make a lettuce I don't know well indeed I really everything about vegetables

271
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,040
 really wow if I've been if I've been beta reading this there will be a there's a whole

272
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,120
 section at the beginning where there which I think is meant to be character development and

273
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,640
 introduce use the characters where they're kind of tetrally talking about food in this locked room

274
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,800
 and and all of that I found kind of tedious and not moving things forward fast enough and not

275
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,640
 really expanding on the characters as much as you might think it would I can see I can see the

276
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:04,000
 vegetable thing being annoying it is like one sentence um I'm like yeah here's to really

277
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,960
 annoy both of you which fair but like and again I think it's sentence that makes sense in in

278
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,920
 terms of like the current state of the art in food printing but if she had just deleted that

279
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,640
 one sentence no but but then but there's actually a lot of stuff about when they're kind of talking

280
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,800
 about the early scenes so they're clones and they none of them know each other at all at the

281
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,160
 beginning of the book they're all they're all blank clones and they're supposed to be having

282
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,200
 the sorts of conversations that you have with people that you've only just met and the conversations

283
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,520
 they have are not at all those sorts of conversations um they are they are tetrically conversations

284
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,440
 between people who are massively not guessing along with each other which just fit with the

285
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,800
 end of the book but but it is also tricky because if I woke up and found my own dead body floating

286
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:58,240
 in front of me I don't know how similar that would be to an icebreaker oh I've had next time I'm going

287
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,280
 next time I go on a management training course I have a whole plan oh no oh no but yes I think

288
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:11,840
 the point about hacking is frustrating I do get that I will say in general willing to forgive

289
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,440
 this in all fiction because vanishingly little fiction actually gets the act of hacking right

290
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,320
 um like Murderbot's a great example where none of the computer stuff makes any sense at all

291
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,200
 but I kind of just let it wash over me and this felt like that but I can see the point for sure

292
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,320
 I liked actually if you're gonna go on to different bit can I just come back on that I think there

293
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,000
 is so there's well there's two reasons that annoys me one is it talks about DNA in ways I think

294
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:51,040
 a don't seem super realistic about DNA there's a bit where um yeah like Maria is um who is the

295
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,520
 hacker character it seems to be sort of telling the AI out to do something about like making her

296
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,080
 own DNA matrix and it's just like easy but I think the real reason it annoyed me is it comes to

297
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,440
 have another bit of the book which is this is like fairly mid to far future and it doesn't feel

298
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,440
 very mid to far far be like 30 years time yeah that's fair I think that that's a coherent um I think

299
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,720
 that's a current point I will say as a physicist it always amuses me when biology is in science

300
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:30,240
 fiction because I think we've said this on the podcast before but I mean Liz like oh my fucking

301
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,720
 god if that annoys you imagine if you're a physicist because it's all nonsense it's true because I'm

302
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,680
 like FTL fine what that should I talk to you about mathematics in science fiction sometime

303
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,720
 when it's happened episode one day about just like the one that gets me the worst is alien

304
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,120
 covenant with the solar storm at the beginning because it's just like everything at the beginning

305
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:02,480
 of that movie is totally wrong and like it's closer to my expertise than usual so I did find it harder

306
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,680
 but yeah no I mean it is that it's interesting that she basically positions like DNA and

307
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,120
 personality hacking as effectively computer hacking but like the bit where she like you can

308
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,920
 comment out someone's personality like I don't know like I suspect that's impossible but then again

309
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,320
 like you know maybe in 500 years or just something we all do who can say yeah can I can I make some

310
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,720
 suggestions I can absolutely call it with applause all the way that you would kind of you know have

311
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,840
 a way that you silence the you know various bits of DNA with a you know halfway plausible mechanism

312
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,240
 but what it sounds like is she just kind of goes at the computer and types some hashes in and then

313
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,640
 it doesn't do anything it just felt like it was all a bit too close to like this magically happens now

314
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,960
 yeah but I think this is any sufficiently advanced technology right yeah but I think

315
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,240
 does it tie into what Liz said earlier about it doesn't feel far enough and I think I wonder if

316
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,960
 the setting felt further future elsewhere it would be easier to forgive those bits maybe that is

317
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,600
 a thing I mean absolutely like these things would be these things would probably not bother me if I

318
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,440
 you know other bits of the book were making up for them for me but since I didn't particularly

319
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,640
 like other bits of the book they then become really annoying I mean that does that definitely

320
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:34,000
 happens the bit that annoyed me I did have a bit that did annoy me is Maria why not just let them

321
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,160
 shoot her whenever she gets kidnapped she knows she's gonna die eventually so just like don't like

322
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:46,240
 I get and I guess that like I don't think she does I think it comes as a bit of a surprise

323
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,720
 hmm I think she says well the first time I don't think she does but I think the second time she does

324
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,760
 because the second time she remembers she has the gap of three weeks and she's like oh shit this

325
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,720
 is happen before but like so the first time I can see why she complied but the second time I was like

326
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,640
 oh no I think it's because they would destroy her clones right oh do you think oh I hadn't thought

327
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,600
 of that the reason she's being brought back to life is because they know they need her again

328
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,280
 if she doesn't go along with what they want they will they'll kill her and not and make sure her

329
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:25,280
 clone isn't resurrected yes oh she no okay I like that I like that explanation actually yeah fair

330
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,440
 enough plus it's it's horrible I mean they're threatening to torture and you might say well I'm

331
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,040
 gonna if they kill me I'll be resurrected I won't have any memories of this but in the moment I

332
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,240
 don't think that would be a very compelling argument no that is fair but also Allison's point

333
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,120
 like I think there's a point where they mail her clone back to earth right yeah and they wouldn't

334
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,840
 do that and then she'd never be resurrected yeah the reason they're doing that is they know she'll

335
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,000
 do it they know she goes through with it and it's possible that eventually she wouldn't and indeed

336
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,320
 she gets packed off by Sally on her ship full of un-munch deplorables deplorables yes

337
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,600
 it's in I mean I do yeah I do like how they're all connected at the end the the second time Sally

338
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,760
 was mentioned I was like oh clearly they're all she's she's deliberately got them all together now

339
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,280
 why so I didn't hadn't worked out that they were all people she really wanted to effect effect an

340
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,560
 event a revenge on but you know I did it was obvious she was gonna come in for each of them

341
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,760
 because otherwise why on the other hand I was fairly blindsided when it turned out the AI was

342
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,640
 the seventh character and I was very obvious if you were reading the book so you know I get some

343
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,520
 things I don't get other things in the bit we recorded before the spoiler I said like there are

344
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,480
 enough revelations that if you this book kind of I guess there's two ways of doing a twist which is

345
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,880
 you can have one twist and you're just very confident that you've disguised the twist well

346
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,120
 enough that people won't guess it or you have 17 twists and you operate on the basis that if

347
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,880
 someone gets 12 of them five will still be surprising and this book definitely takes the second option

348
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,520
 but I don't think it does it it doesn't feel I mean the way I've just said it out loud listeners

349
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:09,600
 you might be thinking god that sounds awful but I did not find it awful because none of them felt

350
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,840
 like completely out of the blue like Alison says like when the seventh character is revealed

351
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,800
 you're like oh no okay yeah no that doesn't it doesn't feel like it's out of nowhere because there

352
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,160
 is a character who has been mentioned multiple times who it turns out is the AI and like you say

353
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:29,120
 like you work out Sally's involved very early in the book but the the full extent of the plan

354
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,480
 becomes clear later but you might not spot it if you think you've already spotted what's going on

355
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,400
 so I did I did quite like those aspects of it we've been recording for 43 minutes should we like

356
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,680
 record final thoughts and wrap up um or does anyone have anything burning that they would

357
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,440
 still like to say out loud I think I've covered most of it I'm trying to think is there anything

358
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,360
 else I knowingly wanted to say I'd I had one thing I did work out that I wanted to say which is that

359
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,600
 I am not alone in thinking the dialogue in this novel leaves something to be desired that um

360
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,360
 quite a lot of the dialogue has both the problem of being clunky things that people don't say to

361
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:13,760
 each other and also the two sides of the conversation not sounding as differentiated as you want to

362
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:20,000
 in novels where you're deliberately stylizing the conversation so it it both had the problem

363
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,800
 that novelistic dialogue has and it didn't have the excuse for it that was my dialogue point

364
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,080
 it wasn't just a dialogue for me I think the writing is very you know it does what it needs to

365
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,120
 but I have been reading a book that's kind of more on the literary end of science fiction that has

366
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:42,400
 very kind of a very distinctive style and kind of makes the character voices more distinct and I think

367
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,440
 this book probably unfortunately suffered from being read straight after I was reading that one

368
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:55,200
 so this book was up against the following novels when it was on the Hugo ballot it was up against

369
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,840
 the stone sky by N.K. jemisin which is the conclusion to the to the trilogy it was up against the

370
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,280
 collapsing empire by john scowsy new york 2140 by kim stonley robison provenance by ann lecky

371
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,160
 ravenstrategy by yun harley and then six weeks by merlafti four orbit one tall one salaris in the

372
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:21,200
 end so like for me this book is like in my top half of that ballot but i don't know whether you guys

373
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,880
 have read the others and have an opinion i think i've actually read all of those maybe not it's a

374
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,560
 collapsing empire the first one of that series by scowsy yeah in which case yes i have read all six

375
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:41,680
 and i would probably put this one in the bottom half sorry john pare enough i like it i like it

376
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,680
 better than provenance and the collapsing empire i think and i like it probably slightly better than

377
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,760
 ravenstrategy but i thought ravenstrategy was the worst of that trilogy so yes i think i think it's

378
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,880
 about i wrote about the same as provenance i think i like ravenstrategy a bit more but in a way

379
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,920
 the ravenstrategy and in fact the whole kind of hexarchate novels and series of stories basically

380
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,720
 scrapped some kind of itch for me that i really like and so i'm willing to forgive them a lot

381
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,360
 in the way that i think things that annoy me in six weeks you are willing to completely forgive

382
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:22,400
 i bet the maths in the ravenstrategy drives alice not the wall um i have not read the raven

383
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,720
 stratum but maths in science fiction novels generally drives me up the wall what you have to

384
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,760
 bear in mind about the unaali trilogy is it's span a scene of science fiction because if it's

385
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,560
 science fiction it doesn't make any sense at all oh unaali um that's the one that's the one

386
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,800
 because speaking as a man who understands time well as well as anyone understands time

387
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:56,480
 like those books are cray but they're great i love them yes nine fox gambit nine fox gambit is the

388
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,160
 book that i have started to read and stopped more often than any other book ever in my life

389
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:11,440
 Liz you guessed correctly and and and this is why it's the book i was grasping for and i said

390
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:20,240
 earlier oh god don't get me started on maths's science fiction novels no i mean yeah uh fair

391
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,440
 i'm glad we brought it up now the point about maths is that i understand why physics could

392
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,560
 be tush or biology could be tush but maths just is it's a description of the way in which

393
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,640
 it's not like physics is lies alice and no it's pattern the point is that you can imagine a

394
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,440
 universe in which you had different physics or different biology right but the maths is just

395
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,200
 a description of patterns and how they are that's what it is that was the old thought podcast and

396
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,560
 it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

397
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:13,360
 [Music]

398
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,440
 john have you been listening to tansy garden striking out podcast because one thing she

399
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,320
 declares up front in that is basically she's got like a fog horn noise and whenever there is

400
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,440
 like a person she has to discuss but she wants to let you know that you know there have been a

401
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,080
 bunch of me two reports and you know accusations of harassment or whatever about the particular

402
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:40,480
 person after the first time she just sounds the fog horn in the background so she'll say you know

403
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,760
 something like screenwriter paul haggis rob and then it will just carry on as normal and i think

404
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,240
 we want that noise we don't need that necessarily for our podcast but i do enjoy that it's just sort

405
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,560
 of a fog horn noise the theme music for this episode was surf shimmy by kevin mccloud and
