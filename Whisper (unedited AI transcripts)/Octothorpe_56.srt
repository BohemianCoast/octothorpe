1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Well the issue is that we don't have any show notes because we've been busy.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,400
 So if it's less structured than normal...

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,400
 There, this is not going to be our most structured moment.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
 Do we actually not have any show notes?

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,800
 Nope.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,600
 We have nothing.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
 Jesus.

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,200
 But loads of things happened.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
 We should introduce ourselves properly.

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
 In case anyone here doesn't know who we are.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,800
 But just put your hand up.

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,600
 Does anyone here not listen to Octa Thorpe?

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,600
 Interesting.

14
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
 Okay.

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,000
 Does anybody here listen to Octa Thorpe who does not yet have a ribbon?

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,200
 I mean, they're all going to need a ribbon because they're all about to listen to Octa Thorpe

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
 so they all qualify.

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,800
 But no, you're right Liz.

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,200
 We should introduce who we are.

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
 Apparently.

21
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
 Really?

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
 Yeah.

23
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,200
 Well we could do that after we do the actual podcast opening.

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,000
 We could do the podcast opening we always do and then we could do introductions.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 That's a good idea.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I'm glad you came up with that Alison.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,800
 But I was worried that you wouldn't, you'd do it instead of the opening to the podcast.

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
 Okay, fine.

29
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,000
 This is what it's always like, Liz.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Yep.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 It's true.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Well no, because usually we're sober.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:22,800
 So, you know, strap in.

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,600
 Hello everyone and welcome to Octa Thorpe, the podcast of science fiction and science fiction

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
 fandom.

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
 I'm John Coxon.

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,760
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,680
 And for those in the room who have not yet listened, we are a podcast that discusses things

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,800
 and we are people.

40
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 That's a good introduction.

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
 I've nailed it, right?

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
 Yeah.

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,440
 Do you think they might watch it or who we actually are?

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
 Sorry, I'm John.

45
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,040
 I'm a podcaster, self-evidently.

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,240
 I am also the head of communications for the 2024 EasterCon by day.

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,680
 Thank you, thank you.

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,840
 By day, I am a space plasma physicist and by night I play board games.

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,480
 I'm Alison and I've been struggling because every time I think of a list of all the things

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,920
 I have to plug, I forget some of them.

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,000
 But I am director of communications for the 2023 EasterCon conversation, which you sure

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 all join.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,080
 I run a tiny micro business called Stoshirts and you can get T-shirts, stand up and bottle

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,480
 your T-shirt, John.

55
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,200
 You get T-shirts, including the exclusive Oxford Slope T-shirt at eastercon.stoshirts.com

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,880
 or you wouldn't be able to buy some things from my store if I had any time to spend all

57
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,320
 the store this weekend.

58
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,880
 I, what else am I doing?

59
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
 Quite a bit.

60
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
 Drinking?

61
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
 What?

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
 Drinking usually.

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 I've also been drinking in the car anyway.

64
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,200
 I'm ready, meet me later because I want to meet everyone at the E-Con every time.

65
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,600
 I don't always manage it, but I often do.

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,240
 I'm Liz, I am the only member of the podcast not currently working on an E-Con committee.

67
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,040
 But, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,120
 because also you are, I'm the only member not working on a world con bid at the moment,

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,960
 so, or no an actual seated world con.

70
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,480
 Not a world con bid, some of us are working on, well, I'm not actually officially working

71
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
 on a world con.

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,400
 I'm working a little bit on my world con.

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,920
 So Liz is working on a world con, so therefore thinks that that counts as not working on a

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
 Easter con.

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,840
 I can give it up at any time.

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,880
 When I'm not working on a world con, I do this podcast with John and Alison, and my

77
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,480
 day job is doing genetics of tropical medicine.

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,000
 And I'm usually in Thailand, by the way, I live in Thailand and therefore I make the

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,600
 other two podcasts at ungodly times of the morning in order to fit with my time zone.

80
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,480
 So yeah, it's a massive novelty to be in the room with them.

81
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 Yes.

82
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,320
 It is actually really, really nice because we've been in the room, we kind of got some

83
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,960
 time together last summer, but we weren't actually doing the podcast.

84
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,920
 So this is the first time we've done the podcast live in the three of us in front of an audience.

85
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,480
 So that is fantastic.

86
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,320
 We just said that if we had shown it.

87
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
 Probably.

88
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,720
 So, yeah, there's been news, there's been an Easter con.

89
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,600
 Has everyone enjoyed the Easter con?

90
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 Yeah.

91
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,680
 And it is the first Easter con since the Easter con in 2019, which was held a long way from

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,240
 here.

93
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
 No, sorry, it was held here.

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,640
 First in person.

95
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,520
 First in person Easter con.

96
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,840
 That is true.

97
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,000
 So yeah, what do we think of this Easter con, peeps?

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,960
 What have we enjoyed?

99
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,840
 We should talk about the building session.

100
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,920
 So I have this query, which is it turns out that people can remember when they think

101
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,160
 about it for contested Easter cons.

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,800
 And I was on one of the committees of all four of those bits.

103
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,360
 Am I the asshole?

104
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:05,040
 Well, I think I just think I like that statistic and enormous amount.

105
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,440
 Thank you for bringing it into my attention.

106
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,880
 What were the four bits that were contested, Alison?

107
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,800
 So the very first Easter con I was on was Folly con.

108
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,840
 And we, at the time, they were great Easter con wars.

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,120
 There was great ideological split about what the Easter con should be like.

110
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,520
 And the other bid, which was 88 in Harrogate, was very much a kind of fancy, all-time fancy

111
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,120
 in fans bid.

112
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,560
 And we were kind of the, actually, Easter con should be a massive party for everybody type

113
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
 bid.

114
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
 How things change?

115
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,760
 The following year, that was quite, that we won by miles for lots of reasons.

116
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,920
 But then the next year, there was a bid which people didn't think was a very good bid, which

117
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
 was unopposed.

118
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,000
 I won't say what it was, but Chris O'Shea and I ran a spoof bid against it.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,360
 And we very nearly ran and just had to go to a lobby vote.

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,600
 It was only because we stood up before the lobby vote and said, "Do not give us the Easter

121
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,120
 con, you horrible people that we lost the lobby vote."

122
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,320
 So that was the only other lobby vote that there ever was.

123
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,280
 The last year of this year.

124
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,760
 So what was, how did you enjoy?

125
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,960
 Because I've been going to Easter con since 2007, so yesterday was my first contested bid.

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,760
 So who here remembers a previous contested bid session they wrapped by show of hands for

127
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,440
 the streaming audience and listeners at home?

128
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
 That's about 10 people, I would say.

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,400
 So probably about 20 or 30 people who don't.

130
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,560
 So it was not full.

131
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
 It was fun.

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
 I mean, it wasn't...

133
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,920
 It was not at all fun.

134
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,040
 It was probably fun for people on the 24 bid, which was not contested.

135
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
 It was not fun.

136
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,320
 I mean, it was a thing that we did, but I didn't find it.

137
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,240
 I don't really like competitions.

138
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,880
 No, it felt very strange because there were essentially two groups of people I like who

139
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
 are both my friends.

140
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,480
 And then I have to pitch which one is, you know, not more my friend, but which one is

141
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,880
 giving me the Easter con that I would like to see more.

142
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,080
 And inevitably, one group of people I know is going to be disappointed.

143
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
 And so I do prefer it when they're not contested.

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,640
 I mean, I guess you can say that it is a good thing if they get contested because it does

145
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,880
 kind of force you to up your game a little bit.

146
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,520
 You can't just assume that you are going to be voted in.

147
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,480
 You do have to put in a lot of effort there to really present what you're going to do

148
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,280
 and have a good, you know, a good kind of solid idea of what you want to do.

149
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,960
 But on the other hand, I also can't really see any difference between, you know, what

150
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,080
 the 2023 bids presented me as contested bids and what the 2024 bid presented me as a very

151
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,280
 polished bid that was unopposed.

152
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,760
 Yeah, I did feel a little bit like I think it was all very kind of amenable and I know

153
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,360
 the bids have talked and that you've discussed about sites and things like that.

154
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,840
 But it did feel a bit like I don't like seeing my friends, you know, disagree.

155
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,240
 So I feel like sometimes you have to do things that involve competition, that you don't always

156
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,200
 get to say, well, we're just going to let things ride on in a steady state and take

157
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,360
 what we're offered and that was part of the metafation plan that bid.

158
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,560
 Our commissions then had a lot of personal challenges.

159
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,480
 Maybe we expected some of them and we didn't expect all of them and it's been, we have

160
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
 worked incredibly hard.

161
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,840
 So it's quite nice to win, I guess.

162
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,120
 But there's this, oh, and now we have to run the East con next year.

163
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
 Okay.

164
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
 Breathe.

165
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,560
 I mean, being contested meant that we've done quite a lot of work that I think if we

166
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,040
 were an uncontested bid, we wouldn't have done yet.

167
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,400
 Liz did remark that it does mean that she can't take the piss out of East con for the

168
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,840
 next two years, but we've reassured her that she can, we'll just pretend she isn't.

169
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,240
 Well, yeah, you're always going to get an official response from a director of communications

170
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,800
 of the relevant East con, aren't you?

171
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,720
 It's not me, we have to say own Brandon on message for two years, John.

172
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
 Oh.

173
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,400
 Only one year for Allison.

174
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,960
 That's true.

175
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,000
 Yeah, I challenge Allison stay on brand for two minutes.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,200
 When we were doing the Q and A for the bid, we have quite a lot of Q and A. So there are

177
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,320
 areas where there was like, this is, this is the line and this is not the line and please

178
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,280
 try to keep reasonably close to the thing that is the line and not the thing that is

179
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
 not the line.

180
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,400
 But for most things, I was just kind of like, we will do better as a bid if you are reasonably

181
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,680
 relaxed and use your own voice to say things that you think are true.

182
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,280
 The thing that will keep you on message is that you've been in the team rather than because

183
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,360
 you've learned to set up lines.

184
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,320
 And it's always worked for me except for the 99,000 times a test.

185
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,600
 So the, yeah, no, the lines you set up as the communications person for your convention

186
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,800
 should be reflections of the team that is running the convention.

187
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,560
 So if you have done that properly, their natural voices should be hearing relatively

188
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,280
 close to the lines without too much effort.

189
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,800
 And that was certainly the approach we took for our bid.

190
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,680
 And so it doesn't matter if people extemporize around a point because it was their thoughts

191
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,640
 that shaped our policy anyway.

192
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,880
 So that is where our policy came from.

193
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,240
 So yeah, this all dreadfully serious.

194
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
 Sorry, everyone.

195
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,760
 Liz, tell the joke.

196
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,040
 I don't have any jokes.

197
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,840
 I will just say I've checked on Discord and apparently we should repeat audience heckles

198
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,880
 so the streaming audience can hear them.

199
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,840
 We will repeat all good heckles.

200
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,400
 So if we don't repeat it, it's because it was bad heckle.

201
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,880
 Yeah, what do we think?

202
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,080
 So, what, but what have we enjoyed about Eastacorn?

203
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,360
 Because I asked that a while ago and we didn't really actually answer it other than the bid

204
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
 session.

205
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,960
 Well, I was going to say, well, we've, you want an Eastercon and I want an Eastercon.

206
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,320
 Liz, have you lost everything this weekend?

207
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,600
 I've won by not winning an Eastercon.

208
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,200
 But have you lost everything this weekend?

209
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,280
 Yeah, I also may have lost something.

210
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,000
 I mean, I lost my coat twice.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I lost my jumper like three times.

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Liz.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 That's what you mean, right?

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,200
 This is why we need show notes.

215
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,360
 Liz, have you lost an award nomination this weekend?

216
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,480
 No, we haven't lost the nomination.

217
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,640
 Still got the, we will all, it's honour just to be nominated.

218
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,160
 And then, and then we were sat in the audience and we were like, yeah.

219
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
 And then, you know, in our heads, you were like, nah.

220
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,640
 It wasn't, didn't mind, didn't mind at all.

221
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
 Oh, no, I mean, sorry, we didn't mind.

222
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
 We were completely, it was fine.

223
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,160
 Were you very disappointed?

224
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
 No, not particularly.

225
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,440
 I mean, it was nice to be nominated and something good won and it was nice to be in the room

226
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
 when that happened.

227
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
 Yes, no, that was true.

228
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,320
 Yeah, we were, because, because the thing about the BS event, I mean, thank you everyone

229
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,960
 who nominated us on veg for us.

230
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,600
 We were very grateful, but it was basically five beautiful swans.

231
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
 And, and, and then us.

232
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
 And what were we?

233
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,960
 And we were a pedal-o.

234
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,920
 [LAUGHTER]

235
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,200
 So like, and you might want the pedal-o, the pedal-o is good, you can pedal it, but it

236
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
 isn't a swan.

237
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,880
 But it's ironic and we want to talk about this because we are not eligible for the fan

238
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,640
 awards for some reason, but we are eligible for the BSFA awards despite the fact that

239
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,080
 in the eligibility criteria for the BSFA awards, it does say it's for a written work

240
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
 of nonfiction.

241
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,720
 Now, this therefore presumably means we were nominated for our show notes.

242
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,720
 So thank you all very much for nominating the show notes.

243
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,200
 I'm glad you appreciated them.

244
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,680
 I spend a lot of time putting the links in.

245
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
 So thank you all.

246
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
 So all that fiction.

247
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
 Surely, fiction.

248
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
 [LAUGHTER]

249
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,800
 Yeah, no, next time we'll be short of fiction.

250
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
 No, fiction for younger readers.

251
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
 [LAUGHTER]

252
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,960
 We're going to have to stop swearing.

253
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
 Fuck.

254
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,600
 [LAUGHTER]

255
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,920
 So the really interesting thing about the BSFA award nomination, well, there's two.

256
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,520
 But the first one was that two days before the Eastcon, one Nicholas White, who is the

257
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,160
 fangest of honor at this Eastcon, wrote a blog post in which he said, "Well, this is

258
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,680
 my favourite of the nonfiction things, and I personally will be astonished if they don't

259
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,800
 win by a large margin."

260
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,040
 So we want to know is if anyone was in the room, was there some kind of test of Nicholas's

261
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
 astonishment, should we?

262
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,040
 I should say Nicholas is in the audience, and is very embarrassed by this.

263
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
 [LAUGHTER]

264
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,360
 It's like, people were like, because John was in the bar going, "Ha, Bob Beanie's going

265
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
 to win."

266
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,160
 And I was like, "Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense if you think about who is a member

267
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,680
 of the BSFA, but you have to remember that Nicholas White is a professional syphallogist,

268
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,840
 and actually goes on to-- so imagine you were on BBC Northern Ireland now, Nicholas."

269
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,800
 May I say that I am officially astonished?

270
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,640
 [LAUGHTER]

271
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,160
 [APPLAUSE]

272
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,720
 But it's a pleasure to be here.

273
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,880
 Well, and also this was very sneaky, because Nicholas said in that same blog post that one

274
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,880
 of the reasons that he nominated us for the award this year was because he was in it last

275
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,720
 year, and he's just been in it now, so it was a ruse.

276
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
 Ha, ha, ha.

277
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,840
 So I'm going to go around the room now, reading out all of your names.

278
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 [LAUGHTER]

279
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,120
 It would take a register.

280
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,760
 Hands up everyone who's been very busy this weekend.

281
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,680
 Yeah, you could have assumed.

282
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
 Look at it, me.

283
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,000
 Now, you've all made a huge mistake, because if you didn't put your hand up, she now knows

284
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,960
 that you're down for volunteering.

285
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
 No, no, no.

286
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,320
 So you could tell the time I'm more experienced senior managers than John.

287
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,800
 I know that the people who will work for me in next year are the ones who did put their

288
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
 hands up, not the ones who didn't.

289
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
 That's how it works.

290
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,720
 Well, the official line of 2024 is that we're bringing new blood into fandom.

291
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
 So, you know--

292
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
 Yeah, see, some people--

293
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
 See, on brand.

294
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,760
 Some people's communications directors manage their lives.

295
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
 [LAUGHTER]

296
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,600
 Liz was wrong, though.

297
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,280
 It was about-- I think it was about five minutes, not two minutes.

298
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
 So what an awesome.

299
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
 [LAUGHTER]

300
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,800
 For the people who've got short attention spans, that was before I went off topic random.

301
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
 [LAUGHTER]

302
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,240
 So yeah, but no, so convention.

303
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
 Very good.

304
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,840
 Hotel-- kind of slight winkle on the first day, but they handled it well with refunds

305
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,960
 for people who had been affected.

306
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
 I think that was a good response.

307
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,080
 I don't think it was a good situation, but I think it is-- it was handled well in the

308
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
 end.

309
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,160
 I feel like there are solutions to cues that are three-hour long cues that do not involve

310
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,560
 leaving the people in the three-hour long queue and managing the people who, for whom,

311
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,800
 it will be catastrophic if they stand up for three hours, but not all the people for whom

312
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,920
 it will be really incredibly irritating.

313
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,840
 I feel like you should probably manage those people as well.

314
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,680
 On the upside, this hotel's breakfast is really fine.

315
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
 Yeah, it's good.

316
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,160
 I kind of love the breakfast.

317
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,320
 And also I got here Thursday, which is why I'm probably a bit more magnanimous about

318
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,760
 the hotel queue that we should have sorted.

319
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:59,160
 We should, as a convention, have interspersed ourselves to sort the cues out more than we

320
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,960
 were able to, but that's partly because the conventions under volunteered.

321
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,800
 Are you going to let Farah speak?

322
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,640
 So just to clarify, we did actually try.

323
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,640
 We turned up with a trolley to try and take luggage.

324
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,800
 We offered to help people who needed access, and only about five accepted.

325
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,120
 People-- I don't know why I think oddly enough it was because people were already stressed,

326
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,680
 but people were actually refusing assistance.

327
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,000
 We can do way better, but I don't want people to walk away thinking we didn't try to offer

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 assistance.

329
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,240
 I don't want to suggest that it was the committee's fault here.

330
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,240
 I do know a lot of-- because I used to work for the Department for Work and Pensions,

331
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,720
 which used to be called the Department of Social Security.

332
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,040
 I know a huge amount about queue-busting that I will bore you with at a bar sometime.

333
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,520
 I did have a lot of fun.

334
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,520
 I stayed up too late and got drunk.

335
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,960
 So that was on Macbrand.

336
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:56,000
 I feel like somebody said to me on about Saturday night that people in general seem more anxious

337
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,560
 and strung out on average at this Easter card than normal.

338
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,880
 And that has led to lots of-- you know, the concept of microaggression.

339
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,280
 I mean, it's led to a lot of microfuckups, where things have just not gone quite as well

340
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,960
 as they could because one of the parties in the interaction was strung out and exhausted.

341
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
 But it was always me and I'm sorry.

342
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,200
 But I don't know if that was also your possession.

343
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 Yeah, I think so.

344
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,800
 I mean, I haven't been to a convention since Easter gone 2018.

345
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,000
 I haven't been around this many people, probably for quite a long time.

346
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,720
 I think I've forgotten in some ways how to deal with big groups of people and big crowds

347
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
 and things like that.

348
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,960
 So I found it more stressful than it would have been a few years ago.

349
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,480
 So Alison and I both went to Corflu and Novricon.

350
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,600
 And so because Corflu was only about 40 attendees and then Novricon was about 400, 300, 400.

351
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,440
 And obviously this convention is bigger still.

352
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,000
 We've kind of had the slow reintroduction, like releasing endangered petaloes into the

353
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,520
 wild.

354
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,480
 And so I don't think I found it as much of a culture shot.

355
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,920
 But I do remember finding Corflu a bit odd and then Novricon a bit odd.

356
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
 So I do sympathize.

357
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,880
 But for me, I think I'd already processed a lot of that prior to this weekend.

358
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,640
 Although it is really good to see Liz.

359
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,320
 And Liz is a great stunt Liz.

360
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,400
 So thank you for being our Liz Liz.

361
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,280
 It's been really good to see a lot of people.

362
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
 Yeah.

363
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,000
 So I'm very sorry to all the people who I have seen, but only very, very briefly because

364
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,480
 I've been running around an awful lot.

365
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:39,160
 I think one of the things that's happened as we've emerged from isolation is that we

366
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,640
 started doing online things.

367
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,560
 And now we can do in person things again.

368
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,840
 We're all doing all the online things as well.

369
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,640
 And that means you're doing twice the things.

370
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,800
 And there's kind of a things issue.

371
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:58,000
 Can you give me a cheer if before this weekend you had a wordle streak and at the time that

372
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,360
 this is being said, you don't please cheer.

373
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
 Yeah.

374
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
 See that?

375
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,520
 Because like a lot of my words will streak now, but it's one.

376
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,560
 Yeah, that's fair.

377
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,920
 So I lost my wordle streak when I moved house and I was like, oh, I'll be able to keep up

378
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
 with that.

379
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,760
 And then the real life was like, no, you won't.

380
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,760
 So I was I was I was wondering whether the convention would would would end some wordle

381
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
 streaks.

382
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,760
 And yeah, has anybody lost their duolingo streak?

383
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,000
 Yeah, I have done that.

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,520
 I wasn't going to I was going to renew it, but then I got distracted by beer and conversation

385
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
 so I didn't.

386
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,640
 I looked at my phone and it was about half.

387
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,360
 I looked at my phone is about half past 11 and that looked at my phone is about half

388
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,040
 past 12 and I was like, oh, no, it's tomorrow.

389
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,560
 But yes, don't do your duolingo on the podcast, Alison.

390
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,840
 Talk about yourself.

391
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,040
 So Liz, yes.

392
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,040
 How have you found being back in the UK and how have you found being at your convention

393
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,480
 other than stressful?

394
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
 It's really nice.

395
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
 I mean, I guess it's the same.

396
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,680
 I mean, the same boat was most of you in that I have not seen most of the people here

397
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,200
 for three or four years.

398
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,640
 And you know, the thing is normally I might come here every couple of years and it'd be

399
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,520
 like, oh, I haven't seen any of you for two years, but actually for everyone, everyone

400
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,880
 is in the same boat that they haven't seen people for two or three years.

401
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,600
 I mean, I am finding it strange that this is, you know, the most people I've been around

402
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,520
 without a mask on for probably two years.

403
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,400
 That is a little bit strange to me.

404
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,560
 I still find kind of how things are going in the UK a little bit weird.

405
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,680
 And also I do honestly keep leaving my coat in places because I forget I have a coat.

406
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,800
 I haven't carried a jumper around for two years at this point.

407
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,560
 What's happened years to the cultural weekend because it's quite hot.

408
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
 No, it's not.

409
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,600
 I feel like we didn't try a little something.

410
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,360
 I mean, I'm a little bit hot in here, but I imagine in here is less hot than Bangkok.

411
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
 Yes.

412
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,200
 It's quite nice in here.

413
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,040
 No, everyone is sweating in the audience.

414
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
 Sorry.

415
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
 It is quite a hot room.

416
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,600
 I mean, it's got to be because it's got all these beautiful people in it.

417
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,360
 We have kind of talked about the fact that both of our East cons are seated.

418
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,400
 I mean, I don't know if we're all we're seated.

419
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
 Yeah, we're seated.

420
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
 Yeah.

421
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
 But some of them might be standing elsewhere.

422
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
 We don't know.

423
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 Yeah, yeah.

424
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,240
 Some of the jokes this weekend have been recycled for a very, very long time ago because it

425
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,760
 turned out that one of the reasons that the bid session had to be carried over was the

426
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,160
 bid session started late yesterday.

427
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,320
 And the reason the bid session started late yesterday is that all of the bids were asked

428
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,800
 to supply presentations on USB stick by one o'clock.

429
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:42,160
 And it turned out that our USB sticks weren't compatible with the conventions USB stick.

430
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:49,080
 And the solution to this was a very wide range of interestingly shaped dongles.

431
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,400
 So we had to stop episode title in the newsletter a decade ago, but I feel like, you know, we

432
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,400
 had several different dongles we used to get the presentation.

433
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,240
 So it took them forever to get the presentations onto the thing.

434
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,640
 And this would be fine if you were the sort of bid that had finalized your presentation

435
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,800
 on Thursday rather than say 1259 on Sunday.

436
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,400
 You find a nice presentation on Thursday?

437
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,920
 I think we swapped out a photo on Saturday.

438
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
 That was a bit stressful.

439
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
 I didn't enjoy that.

440
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,120
 Yeah, I'll never turn a face John ever again.

441
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,160
 Stop gazing at John during the podcast.

442
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,240
 I know normally on zoom you can just stay at him.

443
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,040
 Oh no.

444
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,040
 So someone in the discord asked what I've enjoyed about the con.

445
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,840
 And I've really liked the I think the beer's been really good.

446
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,400
 I really think that obviously like huge things Martin Hall passed away in between the last

447
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,800
 in person East con on this one.

448
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,160
 But I think the conventions and a great job of kind of making sure that that will work

449
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
 well.

450
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,960
 And there was initial rumors about cider, but there was lots of cider.

451
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,400
 So that's good.

452
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,200
 And I've enjoyed the program items I've been to, which admittedly have been not as many

453
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,920
 as I'd have liked to go to, but that was lovely.

454
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,840
 Really like 90 minute slots with our long program in them because I just really like

455
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,400
 having the time to get around.

456
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,520
 And also you've been to people in the middle of that slot and being able to chat for 15

457
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,720
 minutes is really nice.

458
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,480
 And but mostly the people like like yeah, I for me East con is mostly for me it's coming

459
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,120
 home and seeing everyone like seeing the family.

460
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:26,000
 And that is that has been the nicest thing and I've really missed that.

461
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,160
 So I'm really glad we're here.

462
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,400
 And I'm yeah, happy, very happy that we've had that opportunity.

463
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,880
 Yeah, I really like I really like the 90 minutes lots.

464
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,040
 Although it means I go to slightly fewer program items and I otherwise would because I can't

465
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,680
 cram in one an hour.

466
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,880
 I think I think the number of people here feels nice.

467
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
 It feels pleasant.

468
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,600
 It doesn't feel like we're crammed in.

469
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,760
 I haven't had too many problems getting seats.

470
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,880
 I haven't had too many problems getting to the bar in the real L bar.

471
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,200
 It feels like this is sort of the right number of people to be rattling around this hotel.

472
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,680
 And I don't know how I feel if there are an extra 300, 400 people in this space which

473
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,440
 I think it could theoretically take.

474
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,120
 So it's going to be interesting to see how that works.

475
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,000
 Certainly in terms of things like the economics of Easter cons, you know, is there a point

476
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,520
 where they become viable or point where we can have that much space with, you know, that

477
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,320
 number of people in and not be sort of crammed into hotels with a thousand people in the

478
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
 future.

479
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,920
 It makes me feel more comfortable.

480
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
 It just feels nice.

481
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,520
 You can wander around and stop for chat at the side of the corridor without blocking

482
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,600
 the entire convention behind you, that kind of thing.

483
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,160
 I have also been to quite a lot of program.

484
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,760
 I went to three guests of honor talks which were all really good.

485
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,560
 Actually, there were three guests of one of interviews that were all really good and

486
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,520
 all had really good interviewers and guests with lots of thoughtful and interesting things

487
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
 to say.

488
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,920
 And I will now go and buy more of their books if they have books.

489
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,720
 And Nicholas, if you do have any merchandise available, let me know.

490
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,720
 He's got t-shirts that just say "I'm astonished."

491
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
 Nicholas White is astonished.

492
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,000
 I think there's a...I would say Nicholas White won't say it himself, but he's just taken

493
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,520
 his...he finally took his website off dive journal after 109 years.

494
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,440
 And that's some street.

495
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,120
 So he's now at...from the heart of Europe.eu.

496
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,000
 We'll put the link in the show note.

497
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,400
 For anyone who'd stopped reading Nicholas because he was on live journal and it was owned by

498
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,320
 nefarious Russian influences, he's not there anymore.

499
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,680
 He was the last person I was going to live journal for, I think.

500
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,760
 So we shouldn't be on live journal.

501
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,360
 I shouldn't have set up the ought to thought live journal.

502
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
 Fair enough.

503
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,960
 Instagram are not convinced we're real and that is a sticking point.

504
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,680
 I would say I'm discussing it with them, but really I'm just screaming into a void.

505
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,240
 Which is often a feeling I have.

506
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,640
 Especially, no, that's mean.

507
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,320
 I don't feel that when I record ought to thought.

508
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,680
 LAUGHTER

509
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,280
 So there's a comment not a question in the discord which is future conventions should

510
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,840
 have a streaky room where you go to do your streaks.

511
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,200
 Ooh, the streak, the streak up.

512
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,800
 Every day, the streak up, everyone just goes and does their duolingo and they'll, "Oh,

513
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 I like that."

514
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 You should do that at 2023.

515
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
 You heard it here.

516
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
 Yeah.

517
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,000
 And DC has asked an actual question in the discord which is with streaky bacon.

518
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Question rock.

519
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Ahhh.

520
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,200
 So obviously the answer to that question panelists is yes.

521
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 No.

522
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,640
 Do you not like streaky bacon?

523
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,440
 No, I don't like streaky bacon.

524
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,520
 You and his fan, you can have a very large argument after the panel.

525
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
 So...

526
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,120
 Yeah, when his fan is right and loses rock.

527
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,080
 So on zoom I can also just stare at Liz or all the time we're recording.

528
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
 Just say.

529
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,160
 Well, especially when there's a gecko.

530
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,480
 So I'm going to suggest we open it up to the audience in the room because we've been

531
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,680
 taking comments and questions from the online audience and I feel like we should let our

532
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,560
 physical audience say things.

533
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,400
 Oh, but before we do that, Alison has reminded me by whispering that we're going to do a

534
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
 beer of comment.

535
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,680
 So we've got a beer of comment listeners who have listened to that episode will remember

536
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,480
 that the people at this never happens sent us a beer.

537
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,400
 Is anyone on Twitter or Instagram?

538
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,520
 This is our photo opportunity for this podcast just saying now.

539
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,040
 Christina Lake and I've got some alt text on this if you're kind of just listening to

540
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
 this.

541
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,160
 Christina Lake and Doug Bell sent us a beer from Polly's Brewery called This Never Happened

542
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,600
 because their podcast or Christina's and Lillian's and Ian's was called This Never

543
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,560
 Happens but they we had a kind of how to keep on podcasting panel yesterday that John

544
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:45,240
 was on and the answer is you keep on podcasting by continuing to podcast and this this never

545
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
 happens to not.

546
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
 So this is a beer.

547
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,080
 This is not the Instagram opportunity.

548
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,320
 I'll tell you you all know when the Instagram opportunity happens.

549
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,400
 Yep, we made it we made a promise and some promises can't be unmade.

550
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
 Apparently.

551
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,040
 I argued but.

552
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,840
 So the plan was that if we were all managed to be at EasterCon we would share this beer

553
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,800
 which we're going to do now.

554
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
 Okay.

555
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
 Right.

556
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:18,600
 Can we get three straws over here?

557
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,840
 I might take the rest of that beer in a glass if that's alright.

558
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
 Good, good, good.

559
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,920
 It's 13% and it's a quadruple IPA.

560
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,600
 So drinking it from a straw is like it's an adventure.

561
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,920
 Like it is an opinionated beer.

562
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,160
 It's nice but drinking it from a store is a good way to get very drunk.

563
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,280
 It's something you get us three tooth glasses please.

564
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,000
 You know these ones these little ones.

565
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,880
 I'm just going to have mine in this empty my old glass.

566
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,360
 Oh no I haven't.

567
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
 I'm going to use my water glass again.

568
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
 Great radio.

569
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,720
 Right then let's go to questions.

570
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,880
 So I think there is a person in the penultimate row with his hand up that is wearing a black

571
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
 thing.

572
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
 There we go.

573
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
 That works.

574
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,040
 T-shirt John.

575
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
 It was James Shields.

576
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,200
 Yeah just we were talking about the queuing.

577
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,680
 I was very impressed that the Reg desk took the initiative of introducing a badge delivery

578
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,320
 service to people waiting in line.

579
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
 That is good.

580
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
 That is a good point.

581
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
 Well done.

582
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,440
 That was an excellent point and that was a good idea.

583
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,920
 Actually I was really impressed.

584
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,520
 I thought oh god look at the checking queue.

585
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,040
 I'll go and register thinking registration would have quite a big queue because they had

586
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,560
 to check vaccination certificates and things and that was really efficient.

587
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,200
 They were really on top of that and I had my badge in five minutes.

588
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,520
 So then I went back and stood in the whole queue.

589
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,800
 I went to Reg.

590
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,840
 I went can I register myself as Stephen Kane and Marianne Kane and Jonathan Kane and they

591
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,320
 said do you have the vaccination certificates for all of those people?

592
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,640
 I went oh no I do not have the vaccination certificates for any of those people because

593
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,200
 I did not bring my phone but then I remembered that my watch has a tiny vaccination certificate

594
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
 on it.

595
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,120
 Thank you to Duncan for posting a picture in the thread on Discord.

596
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,400
 I know that I am the only one looking at the camera which I think reflects my general approach

597
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,560
 to photographs so that is good.

598
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,200
 I think I was kind of making sure I didn't throw the beer across the room.

599
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,720
 I was trying to get some beer.

600
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
 Do we have?

601
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
 It is really nice look at it.

602
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
 It is.

603
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
 Yes no it is lovely.

604
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
 It is a very strange colour.

605
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
 It is a very strange colour.

606
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,040
 Hang on and I have got to log it on untapped.

607
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
 I had almost forgotten.

608
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,240
 Oh we do have to log it on untapped possibly with that photo.

609
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,160
 That is a lot of effort.

610
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
 But.

611
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,800
 While they are logging things untapped do we have any more questions from the audience?

612
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,760
 Let's go to the person on the end of the front row here first please and then we will come

613
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,240
 to the person over here.

614
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,000
 Is there a possible code of conduct violation for having a streak up?

615
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 I did wonder that when I said it but then I thought oh if we just skate right past it

616
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,440
 no one will notice.

617
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,600
 But yes we have to call it a streak.

618
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,120
 No it is not better.

619
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,560
 We call it the being on your phone meet up.

620
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
 That will work.

621
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
 This is very nice.

622
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,040
 So it is sort of like Tosi.

623
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,560
 I see why it is called a milkshake IPA.

624
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,040
 It is also very strong.

625
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,600
 We did try and get a beer called octa thought.

626
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
 Because obviously we did.

627
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,400
 We are very conceited.

628
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,600
 That is I emailed the brewery on and tapped I found that does a beer called octa thought

629
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,680
 and they said they stopped making it in 2005.

630
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,600
 So if any of you are brewers please do make a beer called octa thought.

631
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,760
 By that I mean Dave if you are in the audience still there you are.

632
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
 I can see you.

633
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,760
 But yes Dave home brews.

634
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,960
 So this beer is brewed in mould in North Wales.

635
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:50,800
 And I have family who live quite near mould and we went to mould one Saturday afternoon

636
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,400
 about 15 years ago quite a while and they have their first ever food festival.

637
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,160
 And this food festival is called a taste of mould.

638
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,320
 And they only served blue cheese.

639
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,720
 They had all sorts of things.

640
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,120
 We just thought about the actual local residence had not noticed it was a thing.

641
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,240
 So do you have any other questions in the audience?

642
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,280
 There is one the person on the front row who is the opposite sides to the person we took

643
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,120
 earlier.

644
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:26,520
 So at some events there are perspex panels between each participant in order to prevent

645
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,480
 cross contamination with pathogens.

646
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,120
 I am wondering if there is a case for opaque perspex panels to stop Alison looking at her

647
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
 co podcasters.

648
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,840
 So basically what you are advocating is that we buy Alison a set of blinkers.

649
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:50,280
 OK so the really strange thing about this is that earlier it was like well obviously

650
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,280
 Alison does not zoom she could look at John or look at Liz for as long as she likes.

651
00:32:53,280 --> 00:33:00,080
 But in fact when I am on zoom I actually look at me.

652
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,640
 I am pathologically unable to drag my eyes away from my own face.

653
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,000
 So if I made a zoom with one other person I only look I turn my own self view off but

654
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,440
 generally speaking if I am a zoom with two or more other people I just look at me.

655
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,920
 So every time I do a hard stare at Alison on the podcast it has been wasted.

656
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,840
 No, no because I have seen them and they are very good.

657
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,920
 There is nothing better than Liz giving Alison a hard stare.

658
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,760
 I feel really bad that because I think it may be right that I have never seen it.

659
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,800
 I have seen many of the hard stares that you mentioned.

660
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,000
 Have you had any other questions about the podcast you have generally about the Easter

661
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,600
Con or about anything else at all.

662
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,160
 Otherwise we will have to go into our reserve show notes that we also haven't written.

663
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
 Well we haven't done pics.

664
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
 I wish to pics.

665
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,200
 And we have all had loads of time to read and consume science fiction media over the last

666
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
 two weeks.

667
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,880
 So over the last week could be recorded.

668
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
 It was our previous episode dropped on this Thursday.

669
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,360
 This is an early record.

670
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
 I have a pic.

671
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,160
 I could do a pic.

672
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,640
 Let's see if we have any questions from the audience.

673
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,720
 I think we should take a question from the man with, where dressed entirely and black

674
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,280
 apart from his pic socks and who doesn't have any hair and I wasn't supposed to say

675
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
 man either.

676
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,800
 I am not doing very well.

677
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,640
 Whose name is Johnny in the front row.

678
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,280
 Also is that like a TFL mask?

679
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
 Like a tube mask?

680
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,520
 Your mask is Victoria line, Machette.

681
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,080
 Oh my god, that's amazing.

682
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
 Oh god.

683
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,400
 It's not really Machette though because if you made a mask out of Machette it wouldn't

684
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:48,840
 stop your, okay so for people who don't know, Machette.

685
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,840
 Hands up if you don't know what Machette is.

686
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,600
 Right, so that's enough, right?

687
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,520
 Machette is the heavy duty upholstery fabric that is used on buses and trains.

688
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,920
 It wears, it has a pile of a number of different lengths and it wears differently which means

689
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,240
 it can cope with essentially the way that people behave on Saturday night on the London

690
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,520
 Transport Network and each underground line has its own Machette and it turns out, when

691
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,000
 we moved into our house, when we worked out last year that we needed a new sofa I was

692
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,120
 like, it turns out you'd get a sofa and a post it in a Victorian line Machette and

693
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,480
 my husband is a very mild man and person but he beat up that.

694
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,120
 I mean I think he's kind of said that I might be able to get like a Machette poof or...

695
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,440
 You can get cushions with a Machette.

696
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
 Yeah, a Machette cushion.

697
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,760
 You'll now need to take the Machette mask.

698
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,760
 So Johnny is wearing a mask in Victoria line Machette and we'll try and get a picture

699
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,920
 of Victoria line Machette into the show notes.

700
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,160
 Hey Team Petalo.

701
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,880
 So the question I had was how do you feel about the dealer's room, more like a dealer's

702
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,720
 happy to oven as a structure, has that been helpful having separate little rooms or difficult

703
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
 things?

704
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
 It's a question to me because I have a dealer on.

705
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,640
 Overall, the whole idea but I think you've been doing a lot of stuff.

706
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,320
 We'll all have a different answer.

707
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,840
 Liz, do you want to go first?

708
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:17,800
 Yeah, for me I prefer the dealers to be in one big room because yeah some of the smaller

709
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,000
 rooms they've been a bit full and I haven't drifted in so maybe I don't kind of drift

710
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,600
 past as many stalls and maybe get pulled in and buy things.

711
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,680
 And also I've really not been to many of the dealers kind of, there's sort of a crossroads

712
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,000
 of corridors and there are dealers past there and I don't think I even realised they were

713
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,760
 kind of dealers quite, are there no dealers?

714
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,880
 Okay, far far is taking a head and telling me they're not dealers past there.

715
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,520
 Okay yeah, they're somewhere past that.

716
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,600
 I don't know what direction because I've got lost a couple of times but basically I

717
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:52,720
 don't think I got to some of the further away dealers so it's just a bit less visible I

718
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,840
 guess because I didn't walk past them quite as many times and pop in but actually I've

719
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,520
 bought very little from dealers anyway because I have no luggage allowance.

720
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,000
 I think yeah so I have, I very confidently brought my suitcase and it was half full of

721
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,680
 crap for the van van and I thought brilliant on the way home it will be half empty because

722
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,240
 I will have no crap.

723
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,720
 And then I somehow very rapidly filled it back up with crap and so I also haven't bought

724
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:26,400
 much from the dealers because I did not really have the room in my suitcase but I quite like

725
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,280
 the separate rooms because I like how kind of it breaks up the space and I like kind of

726
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,840
 like exploring but I do agree that like if you miss one of the spaces, I think it's

727
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,640
 easier to miss one of the spaces than it would be in a larger room so I kind of, I

728
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,520
 think there are pros and cons.

729
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,520
 I definitely think given the space of this hotel it is, the way it has been done has

730
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,520
 used the space in this hotel as well as possible.

731
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,440
 I don't think there is a better way to do it in this venue so I do think it's been a

732
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
 crack and drop generally.

733
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,200
 Quite like the little dealers rooms and we managed to kind of get the windows open in

734
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:10,960
 hours so we got some fluid flow of air but I have learnt, I think one of the things about

735
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,560
 growing up, if it ever happens, is that you learn things about yourself and the thing

736
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,680
 I have learnt about myself about this Eastercon is that I am never ever trading at an Eastercon

737
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
 again.

738
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,480
 If I want to take a dealers table at an Eastercon I am going to get an employee, an elf,

739
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,120
 to do it for me because I have not really, I have spent about very little time on my

740
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,880
 store, it's one of the things that has made it far harder.

741
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,680
 So as I want to eat next week, octa-thop.stoshirts.com or Eastercon.stoshirts.com.

742
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,080
 Brilliant, this has already been plugged in the Discord because people have been asking

743
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
 for the link.

744
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,720
 There are also questions which, there is a question in the Discord, one question which

745
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,000
 I don't suppose you ask because the answer is obviously never, is when will John stop

746
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,560
 flirting with tobes?

747
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,440
 I mean I was going to say, I don't think I have ever flirted with tobes, I have just

748
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,880
 connected with him, I have just connected with him on the level appropriate to his general

749
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,080
 appearance.

750
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,920
 And then the panel also, the Discord also says, are you all used to wearing headsets to monitor

751
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,920
 your loudness?

752
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
 And the answer to that is yes.

753
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
 No?

754
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,760
 So I don't think it's, I don't think Liz does.

755
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
 Do you?

756
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,880
 Liz just uses a headset mic so if she turns to look at something in the middle of recording,

757
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
 the headset will move with her.

758
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,120
 Whereas John and I both use mic mics so we know instantly if we've turned away from the

759
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,120
 mic and lost our volume.

760
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,120
 Yeah, that's true.

761
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,800
 So I can't actually hear myself when I'm recording so I don't know what levels it's recording

762
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
 at.

763
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,080
 But I mean I have decided that as we've done like 55 episodes now, there might be something

764
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
 to this podcasting thing.

765
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,080
 Maybe I should buy a microphone and not use the free headset I got four years ago to do

766
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,400
 every podcast.

767
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,560
 And then John will be excited but then John will have to teach me how to use a microphone.

768
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,440
 So you speak into it.

769
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,960
 I am also excited.

770
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,560
 This convention had a 60 minute, how to use a microphone workshop.

771
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,120
 And I was like, well, I mean I'm quite fond of microphones that I quite like the whole

772
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,960
 microphone thing but I don't think we need a 60 minute workshop but the one tip is monitor

773
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,800
 your ear in ear so that if you are in the habit of turning to look at your co-host, people

774
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,240
 can still hear what you're saying.

775
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,320
 I hope everyone heard that but it was very funny.

776
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,800
 That was a visual joke and the last part of the sentence for the benefit of JT and everybody.

777
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,280
 I don't JT left us.

778
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,480
 No, I think he's still there.

779
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,000
 Oh, thank you.

780
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 I just want to say, I think we need to say it anyway.

781
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 We probably would have said it.

782
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,280
 What I love is you were about to say something for the benefit of JT and then you started

783
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,920
 complimenting JT before you did the thing.

784
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,360
 It's like you knew what I was like when you started to podcast with me.

785
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,360
 So I knew vaguely what you were like but less than I do now.

786
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,480
 There was a question at the pop casting panel which is if you knew, if you...

787
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,880
 I know I am aware of this.

788
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,120
 So Alison said she turned away from the mic and said, can you just, you can't hear me

789
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,840
 now or something of that effect?

790
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,040
 We've forgotten which is the problem.

791
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,840
 Only you had recorded it.

792
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
 I know, right?

793
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,280
 Oh, we didn't do the backup recording.

794
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,320
 It was so trustworthy of JT that we haven't got our backup recording yet.

795
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,560
 Yes, kind of good.

796
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,080
 What's this report?

797
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,040
 Ha ha ha ha ha.

798
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,800
 For those listening, JT just says, sorry, am I supposed to be recording this and got

799
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
 a pause break from the audience?

800
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:40,040
 JT, we might need to swap someone out because clearly better spontaneous width than us.

801
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,480
 Do we want to do pics?

802
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,760
 We've got like seven minutes.

803
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
 So do we have anything else to say on Easter come?

804
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,920
 Maybe before we get to pics.

805
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,400
 We exhausted the internet.

806
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,960
 Oh yes, please join the 2023 and 2024 Easter Cons.

807
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:02,280
 We would very much like to see everyone there in Telford and a mysterious void that may or

808
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,720
 may not be inside time and space.

809
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,520
 Okay, so I don't know about the rest of you but I have been in crunch for the Easter

810
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,000
 Con for the last seven days.

811
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,880
 Oh, and I was like, I've listened to something and it was like, oh, you are, which was my

812
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,960
 pick for last week, that's the only thing.

813
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,800
 So no, I have not consumed any science fiction or fantasy related content that wasn't directly

814
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,120
 related to trying to get something done in time for the Easter Con any time in the last

815
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
 168 hours.

816
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,600
 Oh my God, I have overextended myself.

817
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,040
 Anyway, I mean, I'm picking an actual book now.

818
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,360
 Are we picking like favorite bits of Easter Con?

819
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,560
 You, my view has always been that you can pick whatever you like.

820
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,840
 All right, I'm going to pick an actual book and plug it then.

821
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,160
 I read The Midnight Bargain by C.L. Polk, which is a kind of fantasy, regency romance in

822
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,200
 which, you know, the whole process of kind of the marriage market is complicated by the

823
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,600
 fact that people have magic and magic is essentially practiced only by men and women

824
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,640
 in a prize, more for their ability to pass magic on to their sons than for their innate

825
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,280
 own skills at it.

826
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:20,280
 And it's about two women and one man who kind of end up making changes to this system and

827
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,520
 working at how they personally can fit into this system.

828
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,880
 And you know, there is a strong romance aspect to it of how can you actually have a romance,

829
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,720
 you know, in this situation and how they end up.

830
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,200
 And I really enjoyed it.

831
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,600
 It was a good kind of pre-Easter Con, you know, fun, interesting read.

832
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,280
 So there's your book recommendation for the panel.

833
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
 Nice.

834
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,360
 I, C.L. Polk is at the convention.

835
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,360
 Is that right?

836
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,880
 No, no, I don't think so.

837
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,760
 They are on the Hugo finalist discourse.

838
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
 So that might be what you're thinking of.

839
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,760
 I could be what I think of.

840
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
 Humblebrag.

841
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,200
 That was a humble brag, Alison.

842
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,080
 I saw you sneaking that in there.

843
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,920
 The great thing about, this is something I'm going to say in the BS FA Awards bit, which

844
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,200
 is the great thing about losing the BS FA award is that we had a speech ready at that

845
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,160
 these next time we lose an award, which we think is going to be October.

846
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,800
 We'll have that speech ready to not use again.

847
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
 No, it will be September.

848
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,320
 And this is something very strange happening at TryCon.

849
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,720
 My pick is also a book.

850
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,480
 So on the train down to London from Newcastle, it's quite a long train journey.

851
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,680
 You could read a full novel.

852
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,000
 So I read A Snake Falls to Earth by Darcy Little Badger, which is on the BS FA Ballot and

853
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,160
 also on the Load Star Award Ballot.

854
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,520
 And it is really great.

855
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,440
 It's about a...

856
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,000
 It's about girl and a snake.

857
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 Because Darcy Little Badger is amazing and she sort of explores Native American...

858
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,040
 She writes with a Native American kind of perspective, which I find really interesting.

859
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,480
 And I really enjoyed the book.

860
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,640
 I thought it was really good.

861
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:01,440
 And I've started reading "Redemptor" by Jordan Ifweku, but I haven't finished it yet.

862
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,400
 So I'm not going to pick it.

863
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,040
 But I might pick it next time.

864
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,600
 "Sleak preview."

865
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,080
 We might cut that out.

866
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,000
 Yeah, I know we will do.

867
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,760
 I think we should probably see if there's anything that...

868
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
 Is there anyone...

869
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,320
 Anyone was hoping that Oxford thought live would be like the bottom of this.

870
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
 Good.

871
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
 Good.

872
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,320
 Funny.

873
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
 Cajiran.

874
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
 No, I'm asking the audience.

875
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
 Oh.

876
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,240
 And the Discord audience?

877
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,240
 The Discord are...

878
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,800
 I would describe the Discord currently as amusing themselves.

879
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800
 And...

880
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,400
 I would recommend everyone go and read.

881
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,720
 Go and read the Discord because it is very good.

882
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,120
 I especially like the people who are commenting in the Discord who are also in the panel.

883
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,000
 That is what Discord is so great.

884
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,760
 Being able to be the snark for the panel is just so good.

885
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,760
 I highly recommend everyone's snark about panels in the Discord.

886
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,760
 But in a nice way.

887
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,240
 Don't be mean.

888
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
 Please.

889
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,240
 We're very thin-skinned.

890
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,080
 Please love us.

891
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,680
 Malcolm says he expected more umbs and ahs.

892
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,400
 There's something about the editing of this podcast which is that...

893
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
 Well, I...

894
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,880
 Because I had not done a podcast because I realised that editing was a lot of hard work because

895
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,680
 you had to take all the umbs and ahs out.

896
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,680
 And...

897
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,680
 And...

898
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,000
 John has helped me understand that's not the case.

899
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,520
 You could just leave him in.

900
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
 Hmm...

901
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,920
 John, do you edit out the little awkward silence?

902
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,240
 He's just the awkward, the little bits between.

903
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,240
 Yeah.

904
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
 Um...

905
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
 Well...

906
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
 Yes, so um...

907
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,240
 Sorry everyone, this is uh...

908
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
 Sausage making.

909
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,960
 Um, I have an app called Fairwright.

910
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,200
 Um, and Fairwright, what I do is I import me, Alison and Liz um...

911
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,640
 As different audio tracks.

912
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,920
 And then I cut out anything beneath a certain decibel level um... automatically.

913
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,800
 And then it will tighten everything up.

914
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,000
 So um, yes, silence is kind of just go uh...

915
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,760
 And that's kind of the first step in the editing process.

916
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,960
 And it makes it a lot quicker.

917
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,580
 Before we finish, we just need to say a big thank you to JT who has worked very

918
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,400
 tirelessly to get us streams that we could edit afterwards.

919
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,680
 And we really appreciate the work of JT as a whole tech team this weekend because the

920
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,760
 business of getting it all um... together with the... with the three streams and the

921
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,240
 streaming and everything else has been very hard work.

922
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,600
 And thank you very much indeed.

923
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,600
 Big cheer everyone.

924
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,520
 That was the OctaThought podcast Live and it's goodbye from me.

925
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,880
 It's goodbye from me.

926
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,920
 And it's goodbye from me.

927
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,920
 [Applause]

928
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:37,920
 If you want a ribbon, please come to the front because we have a ribbon.

929
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:59,160
 [Music]

930
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,240
 We have had a question from the audience which is I want to know how not the audience

931
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,480
 discord which is I want to know how much each of them have had to drink and I believe

932
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,360
 that Liz has not had anything to drink.

933
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,000
 I mean not today, no.

934
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,280
 Oh over the weekend I've gotten that for that.

935
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:18,480
 I have had one pint of mild and then I am on my second pint of mild.

936
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,440
 Now I can tell you the amount of units I've had so far this week which is 26 and I didn't

937
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,360
 drink before Eastergum so um you know that's good.

938
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,840
 But yeah no it's been a good weekend.

939
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,840
 The beer's been good.

940
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,840
 I've liked the beer.

941
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,960
 The stout and the mild and the porter but all very good and the ginger beer and the bitter

942
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,640
 and I haven't had the others.

943
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,000
 But my seven day total so far.

944
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,520
 43.9 listeners which is roughly twice as many as me.

945
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,520
 It was good.

946
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,520
 It was good.

947
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,520
 I've had a good weekend.

948
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,480
 Um I might be alcoholic.

949
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,800
 Yeah I don't have a nap for tracking this because as Regulus's will know John and Alice

950
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,640
 and like to track things and I just like to flow through life without tracking them but

951
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,000
 I reckon that 10 units.

952
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 What four point?

953
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 Yeah.

954
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 I'm pretty restrained.

955
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,480
 I kind of reckoned about 10 units prior to getting John's app because I used to go well

956
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,480
 I drink.

957
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,120
 I don't drink much of the week and then every so often I go to a convention and have a

958
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,760
 skinfill.

959
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,600
 And it turned out the first part of that was true but the second part was only true for

960
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,800
 very large values of skinfill.

961
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:26,560
