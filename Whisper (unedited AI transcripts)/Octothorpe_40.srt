1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
 And I have to, unfortunately, I'm going to have to cut all of this out in case I want to rest Liz,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,000
 which is always awkward.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:25,920
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 40th episode of the Octa Thought podcast,

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
 which is coming to you on the 16th of September 2021. I'm John Coxson.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,560
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:44,880
 And we have three letters of comment. Also definitely planning to keep that pause in the final edit.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,760
 Don't do that.

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,800
 Just to illustrate lack of caffeine on the part of one co-host.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,480
 So we are recording earlier than normal today because John is off doing actual things in the real

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,160
 world. So yesterday everyone was like, can you record at nine? And I was like, absolutely,

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,520
 I'll be wide awake and full of beads at nine o'clock. And this turned out not to be the case.

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,200
 I mean, I was skeptical.

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:22,960
 So we got some letters and tweets of comments and one of the first tweets of comment we got was

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,320
 from Brigitte Bradshaw who proposes that a Garcia is a billion units of exuberance.

15
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,400
 And thus a milligarsia is a million units and a killer Garcia.

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,080
 I just don't want to see a killer Garcia. That seems like a terrible, terrible idea.

17
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,360
 A very exuberant and very dangerous.

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
 And also Bug is hungry for traybake.

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,480
 Well, now I'm hungry for traybakes again. So you're hungry for traybakes?

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,360
 Yeah.

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,760
 I could go for some fridge cake.

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,520
 I've had a very nice friend Japan tart. I'm not really hungry for traybakes.

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,440
 You're a very nice friend Japan tart.

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:16,800
 Did we not get a whole pile of letters about the traybake nature of 15s?

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,680
 No, literally no one commented on that. So apparently we nailed it.

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,600
 Thanks listeners. Thanks for, thanks for approving of our take on 15s.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,840
 Or maybe we just don't have very many listeners.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,040
 If you disapprove of our take on 15s, please write in.

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,800
 Even if you're listening to this episode like months later,

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,880
 please still write in. We feed on your approval and disapproval and basically interaction.

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,240
 Shouldn't that be we feed upon your approval and disapproval?

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,680
 As speaking of alchem horror.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,480
 Mark Plummer wrote in saying, "Sorry for the silence from these parts.

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,320
 I'm several episodes behind now and I've decided to skip ahead to the current one.

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,040
 We encourage people to do that if they get behind.

36
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,920
 Please don't let Alk to become a source of stress in your life,

37
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,760
 unless you're innocent in which case it's basically unavoidable."

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
 Mark does say that he got behind with his listening because he's been struggling to get

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
 to grips with the latest version of alchem horror.

40
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,160
 And I know what Mark means because I picked up the latest version of alchem horror yesterday

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,240
 from my friendly local game shop and it's got a lot of cards in it.

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,400
 And I really did have to take my time to sit down and properly digest them all.

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,280
 So I'm right there with you, Mark. I did like the sled dogs though, big up to them.

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,680
 Is there a new version of alchem horror?

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
 Well there's a new pack that came out like on Friday. It's very good. I like it.

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,280
 Oh I see. But there are new packs that come out every Friday, isn't that how they get you?

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,920
 No, they've actually moved distribution models so they're only releasing about two packs a year now.

48
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
 I was getting it confused with Eldritch Horror.

49
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,080
 Oh Eldritch Horror. There was an advert for Eldritch Horror on the back of the booklet that came

50
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
 in my new alchem horror card.

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,520
 Is this the time to talk about how I'm grinding legend in Hearthstone?

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,360
 It's a family show, Alison.

53
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,680
 I just want to say that I got to the very top of level one and had a game where if I'd won the game,

54
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,800
 I would have got legend on three separate occasions yesterday and I lost all of those games.

55
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,720
 And now I'm back at level four and I'm very, very, very, very pissed off.

56
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
 Good time for a podcast, yeah.

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,960
 Mark was surprised by the hard line nature of the discount policy, but he does see a logic to it

58
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,640
 because he does sort of agree with Alison that it does mean some parts of the community are

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,480
 effectively barred from the world con. But he says that he thinks the counter to that is there

60
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,040
 were obviously still in exceptional circumstances. And he thinks that it's good for events like this

61
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
 to have a clear and unambiguous policy lines as it makes it easier for the convention staff who

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,560
 have to deal with the policy on the day. And it kind of, but he says, well, I understand the

63
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,360
 policy does feel like a recipe for no fun. And I think that kind of, we had that discussion

64
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,160
 last episode. I did a coin of where we ended up coming down where we had to say why. But yeah.

65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,040
 Yeah, I think I think fundamentally I do think that conventions will feel slightly less fun for

66
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,520
 a while while there is the whole masking and vaccination and indeed like all events at the

67
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,040
 moment feels like you're like, oh, maybe it's just me. Oh, but we had fun last weekend and it felt

68
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,560
 like majestic fun because we haven't had enough fun recently. So even small amounts of fun feel

69
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,960
 fantastic. So I'm not, I think objectively people will probably have just as much fun as they always

70
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,240
 did. They will have an amount of fun, which is as much higher as the background level of fun as usual.

71
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:55,200
 It's just that we've adjusted the background level of fun. Write in with your explanations

72
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,160
 of how fun scales work and whether a logarithmic or a linear scale and

73
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,560
 set appropriate measurements of fun. We could definitely go there.

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,200
 Now, now I'm a bit sad that we've already assigned the Garcia as a unit of exuberance

75
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,920
 because we really could have tied these two things together if we'd known we were going to say them.

76
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:23,040
 Exuberance and fun and not the same thing, John. I could understand that you might, from your

77
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,000
 point of view, see it that way. I know. That was literally the point I was making was that it was

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,240
 a shame we couldn't use the Garcia for units of fun. So I already made that clear in my statements.

79
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,960
 Okay, so readers, what is the SI unit for fun? Do please tell us.

80
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:49,280
 I believe it's Newton's Permita squared. I'm sure that's not fun. I am not. Anyway.

81
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,120
 God, I feel old now. Mark also says he's been looking at the Discon membership numbers,

82
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,920
 which is excellent. He thinks that they've had about 900 people joining as attending

83
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:09,680
 membership since last November. But he notes that there's only about 280 virtual members and

84
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,680
 there are about 2000 supporters. And he's wondering why more supporters haven't paid the relatively

85
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,400
 small extra amount for virtual access. And I am one of these people because I haven't got around

86
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,680
 to it yet. So I should probably do that because he says it could just be down to, as we've talked

87
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,080
 about before, the general tendency to join virtual convention late because there's no need for the

88
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,440
 attendee to plan their attendance. But he wonders whether the Discon is going to know how many virtual

89
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,160
 members they're going to need to cater for. And that's an interesting problem I thought of.

90
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
 So yeah, I don't know how that's all going to shake out. I think a significant

91
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,880
 proportion. I mean, I think actually we do have walking stick curves for, we have membership curves

92
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,960
 virtual conventions now. Discon could reach out to other virtual conventions and get a pretty good

93
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,240
 idea of of how that's going to work. My guess would be that they'll have double the number of

94
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
 members they have a week before the convention starts. And that's just that's what they should

95
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,320
 plan for. My estimate would be given they've got 280 now they're looking at at least 600. But that

96
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,240
 is assuming the punctuation curve applies to a Worldcom. And I have no idea if it does. But it

97
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,960
 seemed like the best guess you could make at the moment. I mean, I can't remember whether was it

98
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,400
 contested bidding for 2021? I cannot remember it all. But I mean, a lot of those sporting members might

99
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,440
 be people who voted at Dublin, but then absolutely cannot go because they cannot get to US. And also

100
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,520
 not really interested in a virtual membership because of time zones. So you could have a lot of people

101
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,800
 in that situation. I mean, I signed up for virtual membership, but I don't know how much I'll actually

102
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:46,720
 get to watch. That's an interesting point, Liz. But in fact, DC was an opposed at Ireland, as is

103
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,880
 mentioned on the excellent website, worldcom.org by first time call that Kevin Stanley. Yeah, but lots

104
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,240
 of people vote. Yeah. There's a lot of things going on here. I think Worldcon has thousands of

105
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,640
 supporting members, probably somewhere between one or 2000, who are people who never go to Worldcon

106
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,720
 or might go to Worldcon if it's in a city very close to them, but would not otherwise go to a

107
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,440
 Worldcon, but who are readers and who are essentially supporting now to be part of the voting community.

108
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,400
 Now we don't know necessarily whether that's something that's good or bad, but I think it is

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,440
 out there. People do buy memberships just so they can read the stuff from the voter packet.

110
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,240
 I think also, did you say they've got 2,000-800 attending members? I think Mark's bringing facts

111
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:42,880
 into this conversation, which is quite strange. So Mark said that there were 2,500 attending

112
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,520
 members of which 900 have joined in about the last year. Yes, I think those 2,500 attending

113
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:57,200
 members, I think quite a lot of them will not attend, but will not ask for refunds because of

114
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,080
 the whole community support thing. So they could downgrade to virtual. I think there's probably a

115
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,320
 limit for when they have to have done that by. You could downgrade to supporting member by the end

116
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,080
 of August. You can still downgrade to virtual membership until the beginning of December.

117
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,080
 Yeah, so I think that there will be people who are still watching and waiting and considering

118
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,080
 whether they might go. And there will also be people who are definitely not going to attend,

119
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,960
 but either don't get around to downgrading or who downgraded at the last minute because,

120
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,760
 you know, it's the last minute. That's when you do things, isn't it?

121
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,800
 So I think quite a lot of their virtual members will already be attending members.

122
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,080
 And so they're probably, I assume they're accounting for all of that stuff.

123
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,480
 I think it's easier to scale up a virtual convention at the last minute than to scale up a,

124
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,360
 well, it depends how complicated your tech stack is. You'd hope. Yeah, I don't know how easy it is

125
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,280
 to scale up a hybrid convention, but I don't think they're doing proper hybrid. They're doing

126
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,840
 two conventions, one of which is impersonal, one of which is virtual rather than doing a single

127
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,240
 convention, which is hybrid, right? What is the distinction between those, John?

128
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,360
 I think I am right in saying I might be wrong, but I got the impression that virtual attendees

129
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,520
 would not necessarily be able to watch panels which were happening in DC. They would be able to

130
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,160
 watch panels which were being put on virtually by DC. And so I think the distinction between a

131
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,600
 hybrid and a hybrid convention and a physical and virtual convention happening at the same time is

132
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,520
 that virtual members will not be able to interact with the physical convention.

133
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,680
 Is my belief I could be wrong there, right in if I'm wrong listeners, because I might be.

134
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,920
 I don't know. I don't know if it's going to be purely virtual things happening that presumably

135
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,360
 will be streamed somewhere in the convention as well, or if it's actually going to be streaming

136
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,080
 off certain streams from this con. I mean, my suspicion is going to be a mix of both,

137
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,720
 because then you get to include people that can't be there in person. I don't know if you're going

138
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,280
 to have say, online panels with online participants which are streamed to the physical location,

139
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,640
 or even the most difficult thing, panels which are part online and part in person mixed together.

140
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,080
 I don't even know actually. I'd also like to give respect to Mark Plummer for managing to

141
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,800
 find the membership numbers on the Discord site, because I cannot do that. I'm very impressed.

142
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,440
 Mark Plummer regularly impresses me. I should make that into a ribbon, often impressed by Mark

143
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,080
 Plummer. Mark might not enjoy that. He might. I won't do it if you don't want me to, Mark.

144
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,720
 So, I am going to say I have to give a factual update to something I said earlier. I said I was

145
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,040
 only a supporting member, but I have on the very podcast upgraded to a virtual membership for

146
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,960
 the princely sum of 25 US dollars. See how easy it is to do to do it now. I'd like

147
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,320
 there to be lots of people at virtual discount though, because it is the weekend before Christmas,

148
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,640
 I'm not 100% certain how much time I'm going to be able to give it. Christmas involves a lot of,

149
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,920
 you know, faffing about, and I'm normally pretty busy that we can before Christmas, so, you know,

150
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,800
 I think I feel like that'll be a thing. Well done for posing a direct question to Mark on this

151
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,360
 podcast so that he is forced to send us a letter of comment, even if he hasn't caught up on the

152
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,880
 previous episodes. We should get, we could scan the IP addresses of all of our regular listeners,

153
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,560
 and then write questions to all of them for next weeks. Questions to octa-thong podcast,

154
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,360
 where we ask each of you a direct question tailored to your needs and abilities.

155
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:26,000
 Can we do that? I don't think we should do that. I would like to say I'm not sure we know the IP

156
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,400
 addresses of all of our listeners, and listeners, if you're currently panicking that we do, I'm

157
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,520
 pretty sure we don't. I've been watching Mythic Quest and apparently that's an easy thing to find out.

158
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,480
 Yeah, I'm not sure Mythic Quest is 100% factually accurate, but I think maybe we'll get to that

159
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,120
 later on. Well, and also in Mythic Quest, they're not using a podcasting platform that they haven't

160
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,760
 built, which is another key differentiator. But yes, and also Mark finishes by saying that he

161
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,280
 thinks conversation is the most Caroline Mullen convention name imaginable, and I don't know what

162
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,880
 that means, but I'm happy that he thinks it. I do know what she means. How well do you know Caroline,

163
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:12,480
 John? Not very. There you go then. Chris Garcia wrote in to tell us that he is only giving his

164
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:24,080
 letter of comment, 0.36 Garcia's, which is 360 million units of exuberance. Oh, I've just understood

165
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:34,080
 Bugs tweet. The one you read out, 20 million. She's not. She's not proposing the Garcia is a unit of

166
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,080
 exuberance. She's proposing that the RCA is a unit of exuberance, and therefore a Garcia is a

167
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:49,440
 giga RCA. I had not appreciated that. So I say yes. So 0.36 Garcia is only 0.36

168
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,560
 giga RCA's, which is 360 million RCA's. So that's quite a lot of exuberance.

169
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:03,600
 But does Chris giving us 0.36 Garcia's mean that he's only giving us like 36% of his regular levels

170
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,760
 of enthusiasm, or I don't know. Well, I'll tell you, I've only given you 36% of my regular levels

171
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:17,280
 of enthusiasm. I offered multiple times to podcast at a different time for Alison's benefits, and I

172
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,840
 was like, no, no, no, I'll drink some pint of coffee. It'll be fine. I am fine. I am fine.

173
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:30,640
 I am so fine. In fact, I'm I'm definitely at least a bit. What was it? At least a bit,

174
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,600
 Garcia. You're so fine. You're now making jokes about it. We understand.

175
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,920
 Oh, I've just worked out the Briarly. A Briarly is the unit of how many coffees you need in the

176
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,240
 morning before you're awake, measured in points. And that is very, I think, very in keeping with

177
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,520
 Claire's approach to coffee, because I've seen her caffeinate and she takes it seriously.

178
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:02,240
 I believe my normal level is 0.36 Briarly's. I mean, I'm surprised just to live because that is a

179
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,920
 large amount of coffee. So Chris says that losing Earl was a massive bummer and kind of expresses

180
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,160
 some reminiscent about that. And yeah, I can imagine like, obviously, if a friend of yours goes,

181
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,960
 then that is always going to be a huge hardship. And sorry, sorry, sorry about that, Chris. But he

182
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,160
 also writes in about COVID policies. And he says it, he thinks it's illegal to require negative

183
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,200
 testing for attendees. He's basically saying that you can't do negative testing and you can't do

184
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:38,880
 exemptions because of US privacy laws. And I am curious about that. I don't know much about US law.

185
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,280
 There'll be a lot of there's also going to be a lot of state and local jurisdictions. It seems

186
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:50,400
 very likely that DC took advice on what was possible in in the place that the planet told the convention.

187
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,440
 And use that to inform the policy. And he also says he went to a historians convention,

188
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,280
 which was done in a hybrid model, where everyone wore clear masks, but all of the masks were mic'd.

189
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,800
 So if you wore them, it miked your voice underneath the mask. And that is magic. And we did not

190
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,360
 consider that as an option last time. But that is like the idea that you might have. But then I

191
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,280
 guess you'd have to have a mask for our tendees. I can't imagine that's cheap. But that is that

192
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:25,040
 is clever. It's definitely clever. Or a sanitation sanitation system that works for those for those

193
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:32,080
 mics. If we have a sound engineer in the in the audience, please please let us know your thoughts

194
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,960
 on miking under the mask. And incidentally, miking under the mask is the name of a new reality TV

195
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,840
 show and our superhero expose. I would also note that Chris says they sent mini bottles of

196
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,640
 Scotts to all attendees, which is maybe an excellent tradition for hybrid conventions.

197
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,760
 I do quite like that. When we did a leaving party at work, my boss got tiny bottles of

198
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,200
 champagne sent to everyone for the leaving party. And that did feel much more like a leaving party

199
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,080
 than other zoom leaving parties I have been to, where I did not have a tiny bottle of champagne.

200
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:11,840
 I say champagne, prosecco. Fizz. Phil Dyson tweets as to say that he thinks the greatest high school

201
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,840
 movie ever is Heathers, which I have not heard about, but we will put a link in the show notes.

202
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:30,400
 Alison is laughing quite a lot, and I'm assuming that there's something happening here that I

203
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,360
 don't know about. No, no, no, you've not heard of Heathers. No. Oh my god. Oh my god. I understand

204
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,480
 that people are young, but oh my god. How can you not have heard of Heathers?

205
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,200
 Liz, am I, is this, have you heard of feathers? Am I, am I sorry, Heathers? Ah, for enough.

206
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,920
 Yeah, I think I think you are actually an outlier for people, even people of your age, but I might

207
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,120
 be wrong about that. So yeah, no, Heathers is an extremely influential movie. If you have any

208
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:09,680
 interest in the history of, I guess, outcast culture. I think, I think Heathers is quite an

209
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,560
 important movie, and it's also very good. And yeah, and it's kind of, of its time a bit, it doesn't

210
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,800
 necessarily hold up as well as it did when it was new, but yeah, maybe the greatest high school

211
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:28,240
 movie. It's a real counterpoint to a lot of the other things that were around at the time, because

212
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,360
 yeah, because it's different. That's great movie. Yeah, and it's something that often comes

213
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,680
 up on those lists of the best high school movies ever. But I mean, John, have you heard of things

214
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,000
 like, you know, the Breakfast Club and 16 candles and that kind of thing? Because it feels like

215
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,600
 it's of a contemporary of those. I've seen the Breakfast Club, and I've heard of 16 candles,

216
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,960
 and I've watched various Bueller's Day Off, which looking at the date was like about four years before.

217
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,000
 So like, I think I'm familiar with other films that were in that way. I just haven't heard of

218
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,880
 this particular one. Yes. But looking at the cast, I think there is probably an argument that I

219
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,800
 really should have done because I don't think that just don't, we don't think else about it.

220
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,040
 In fact, don't even look at the pack cover. Oh, no, it's too late. Yeah. I read that there's a blurb

221
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:21,280
 and it tells you like, he went to Wikipedia 10 minutes ago. Yeah. Don't read a synopsis, just

222
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,400
 watch the film. It'll be good for you. You like movies. You've been watching great movies. This

223
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,480
 is a movie that you should definitely have watched. If you have any interest in, Heather's is a film

224
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,520
 that is very much in your wheelhouse. You'll appreciate it. From the synopsis, it sounds amazing.

225
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,680
 I'm very, very, very surprised to discover that you do not already seen Heather's.

226
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:49,760
 Go, go. Is the Spaniard around? Yeah. I text her. Yeah. Go, go, go, go and ask his Spanish. Say,

227
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,360
 "Allison is surprised that I've never seen Heather. Should I, should she be?"

228
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,640
 The typing you can hear listeners is me texting my wife to, uh, to ask her this question.

229
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,480
 Well, while you're doing so, I would like to say that, um, while Heather is great,

230
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,720
 if we are allowed to count it as a high school movie, I would like to put forth the proposition

231
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,280
 that Billenteds excellent adventure is the best high school film. Uh, it's a stoner movie. Is that

232
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,360
 a high school movie? I feel like most of it doesn't take place in a high school. I may be not remembering

233
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,760
 but then again, Ferris Bueller's day off almost entirely doesn't take place. Yeah, no, that's right.

234
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,000
 So something like, I mean, there's a sense of which gross point blank. I've heard of that,

235
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,960
 but I haven't seen it. It's a great high school movie. Right in listeners. What's your

236
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,520
 favorite readers? What's the best high school movie? Yep. Anyway, and then we have one final lock.

237
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:48,080
 So Roman thoroughly enjoyed episode 38 and liked the surf sound and the pleasant chat around the

238
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,320
 table and notes. There was no problem with sound balance despite the warnings, but added a little

239
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,520
 note to me saying that there's a wonderful tool called the levelator, which is very good. I'll put

240
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,200
 link in the show notes for anyone who is making podcasts. Good tool to have in your arsenal.

241
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:09,680
 And indeed, I did level the sound. So a secret. Um, and also, um, he's notes. Uh, while Celsius

242
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,600
 may be foreign to the Americans, the rest of us have no real problem with it. Of course, you could

243
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,560
 meet at Denali, Alaska, which is also called Mount McKinley, where the average temperature is

244
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,880
 apparently minus 40 degrees. And therefore, there's no argument about Fahrenheit and Celsius. But

245
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,600
 there might be an argument about whether or not it was a sensible place to go given how bloody cold

246
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:34,560
 it is. Yes. No. I mean, the arguments we have at the moment is me and Alison saying all 21s

247
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,560
 are a bit hot and Liz being like, no, it isn't. Uh, so, but I think we would all agree minus 40 was

248
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:47,200
 quite chilly. One member of our podcast voluntarily lives in Thailand and the other two don't.

249
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,440
 I would just like to say that every minute we record this podcast is a minute that I'm not

250
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,080
 in the swimming pool. So, you know, there's upside. So Liz did send a lovely photo of her

251
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:08,880
 summer office, which had sky and plants and sunshine and palm trees. A very relaxed feeling to it.

252
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
 And it did look very good.

253
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:23,120
 Last week, we didn't go into any detail about the NHS COVID pass, which is a thing that the NHS

254
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:31,440
 offers through the NHS app. And that is not the NHS COVID app. That is the central NHS app. Instead,

255
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,200
 in order to get an NHS COVID pass, you have to have had a full vaccination with the COVID vaccine

256
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,520
 used in the UK. And you can get the past two weeks after your second dose. You can get a pass if

257
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,720
 you've had a negative PCR or rapid lateral flow test within the last 48 hours and you can get to

258
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,400
 the pass as soon as you have your result. And you can get one if you've had a positive PCR test

259
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,040
 within the last six months. And you can get the pass after you've finished self isolating and up to

260
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,040
 180 days after the test. And it notes that none of these are things you can do in the Isle of Man.

261
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,480
 So conventions and attendees for conventions from the Isle of Man should take all this with a large

262
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,640
 pinch of salt. And I believe Scotland, you use the NHS Inform app and then in Northern Ireland,

263
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,440
 use the N.I.E. direct app. And they may have different stuff. But that does mean that if you

264
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,240
 are a convention and you're thinking, how can we offer a way of making sure that our convention

265
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,160
 attendees are less likely to have COVID than they might otherwise be? The NHS COVID pass is a good

266
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,560
 way of doing that that incorporates people who are vaccinated, but also provides options for

267
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,480
 people who cannot get vaccinated for different reasons. And basically just means you have a thing

268
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,400
 on your phone that you wave and it handles all of the things you should have to look and be like,

269
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,480
 yes, that is the NHS COVID pass. We are happy. Hurrah, which takes a lot of the deciding what

270
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,120
 counts as proof parts out of your convention planning. And it's something that convention runners

271
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,360
 possibly should look at as a good thing to do this sort of stuff. I'm going to put a link in the

272
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,640
 show notes. And the stuff I said about Northern Ireland Scotland is at the bottom of the page

273
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,320
 that I have linked. Also in terms of feedback from our last episode in the UK Easticon group

274
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,400
 on Facebook, which we recommend if you like that sort of thing, Fran Dowd said, there's a very good

275
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:29,360
 discussion about conventions, COVID policies and the latest octa-thorpe. Thank you, Fran. And Nick Whitehead

276
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,920
 responded to say, that's very useful because we're currently discussing this for Bristolcon,

277
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,680
 which is one of the conventions we mentioned last time as not having announced their policy. So thank

278
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,240
 you, Nick. Thank you, Fran. And Bristolcon, I did email in between the two episodes to ask whether

279
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,600
 they had a policy and their policy is very much. We would really appreciate it if you could wear a

280
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:59,840
 mask and not have COVID, which is I think a good place to start from. But I would encourage

281
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,360
 conventions to look at the NHS COVID pass, because I think that does more than just politely asking

282
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,840
 attendees not to have COVID. Obviously, see, discussions last episode about, you know,

283
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,400
 you can always, whatever you pick, if someone's really determined to attend your convention with

284
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,560
 COVID, they will be able to do that because you can forge all of these things. The thing you're

285
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,520
 hoping to do is instill a level of compliance in people who are not trying to be actively

286
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,200
 malicious, but may not have thought properly about the safety of everything before going about their

287
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,680
 day. I mean, I was just going to say that I think there is also difference to things like Bristolcon,

288
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,360
 which are basically as big as like a medium size wedding and things like potentially

289
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,960
 a fancy conno-easticon who might be getting into the high hundreds of members. I think if you're

290
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,520
 sort of a smaller convention, like the risks and issues are a little bit different.

291
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,160
 It's so good to have a policy, obviously, but I can see why they've gone for a slightly sort of

292
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:04,400
 softer, yes, please wear masks and so on. I don't know. I mean, is that an artificial distinction?

293
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,160
 I just feel there is a difference between, you know, this conwear would say, well, you potentially

294
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,320
 will have 2,000 people in Bristolcon where you probably will have 100.

295
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,400
 Yes, I think it's a big difference. I have a very mathematical feeling to this, and although in

296
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,360
 practice you probably do hang around with your personal mates, no matter how big the convention

297
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,600
 you're going to is, I think that's the thing about mandating mask wearing in public areas and

298
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,120
 when moving around the convention, because those are the times that you're likely to have close

299
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,320
 interaction with people who you're not just generally hanging out with.

300
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,840
 Ta. So, I will say, although I do understand where both of you are coming from and I do

301
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,320
 understand there's a difference in risk, I do think that most, I find it difficult to imagine

302
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,840
 a convention where I'm like, yeah, but it's fine if people turn up with COVID, right?

303
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,600
 And so I think still I would say use the NHS app because that gives you a good way of saying this

304
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,840
 person probably doesn't have COVID. And that seems like, that seems like my minimum like

305
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,320
 requirement from any event is it would be nice if they were just double checking that people

306
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:19,200
 don't have the owner. Yeah, in the last festival we went to, they were basically checking everyone

307
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,560
 for either an up-to-date NHS app or the text from the NHS say you'd had a lateral flow in the last

308
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:33,440
 24 hours, because obviously that's very fakable as we know, but I don't think anyone necessarily would.

309
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,480
 I should say this lasts for as long as free lateral flow tests are available,

310
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,200
 at which point this system breaks down a bit. It would be a great shame if the government

311
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,800
 stops allowing free lateral flow tests, but at the same time, if you are not doing something

312
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,760
 at your convention to say we would actually quite like to have some measure of control over

313
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,840
 people arriving at our event not having COVID, that is the point which I start saying, I might

314
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,560
 just not go then. And so I do sort of take your point, but if people do go that way of, oh, well,

315
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,840
 we can't demand this because there are no free lateral flow tests, I can go that is a great

316
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:13,600
 shame, but I will stay at home. So I do, I think I actually 100% disagree, you know, sorry.

317
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,840
 I'm hoping the government won't do that, but if they are stupid enough to do that, that will be

318
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,880
 a shame, but it will, I don't think it will change my mind. I mean, I hope they don't, but it does

319
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,600
 make it different to me because I can't get an NHS COVID pass. So, I mean, I'm not looking at

320
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,320
 coming to any UK conventions in the future, but if I do, I can't get one. I'm very much talking

321
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,880
 about like, I think convention needs to think quite carefully about what proof they'll accept from

322
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,800
 kind of overseas attendees. Sorry, I should have said that. So I don't want to rehash the

323
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,760
 discussion we had last time completely, but my main concern with this gone was there,

324
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,960
 they didn't have an exceptions policy. And I feel like you need to have an exceptions policy.

325
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,640
 You need to say, if there's a reason you cannot do this, let's talk. And then you can say, no,

326
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,520
 you're in, you're out. I think that is also very, yeah, because like you say, Liz, like if you can't

327
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,000
 get an NHS COVID pass because like, that's not possible, then then I do think like, you've been

328
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,160
 double-japped. So that should be something that can be sort of coped with. And I kind of understand

329
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,760
 that the DC as a 2000 person convention may not have the bandwidth to deal with the exemptions

330
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,160
 and stuff. But like, if you're a convention that's going to have like 100 attendees, you can probably

331
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,320
 talk to the one or two people for whom there needs to be a conversation.

332
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,880
 Lastly on convention COVID-19 policies, Corflu have updated their website basically along the

333
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,360
 lines of the Novocon website to say, we are going to have a policy, but we're waiting a little bit

334
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,760
 longer before we decide what that policy will be. And I heard from Peter Sullivan, who is on the

335
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,680
 Corflu Committee, that he is now the Corflu Committee member whose job it is to listen to Octa Thorpe.

336
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:05,360
 And that that slightly terrifies me. So, hurrah, thank you to Corflu. Thank you to Corflu very

337
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,120
 much for doing this because I think this is a fantastic development. They all should be. This

338
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,920
 is a brilliant post that every convention should have on its staff. Are they listening to us for

339
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:22,000
 advice or in case we say anything, you know, scandalous? No, I think they're listening to us.

340
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,440
 So that if we say every convention should do X and if they don't will be grumpy, they can be

341
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,080
 like, oh no, we should do X. And that is a level of responsibility that frankly terrifies me.

342
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,600
 I mean, I think there's a lot of things you can do that make Octa Thorpe grumpy and you're never

343
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,880
 going to avoid them all. Because you can do things that will make one third of Octa Thorpe grumpy in

344
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,480
 two thirds very happy. We just do that one. That's another podcast. This podcast might or might not

345
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,800
 be based on said, it's a job to be grumpy about conventions. That's what we do. But I think it's

346
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,440
 also important to be happy about conventions when conventions do good things. And so I think

347
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,160
 Corflu has done a good thing. And they're also spooling up their discord. And that's very exciting.

348
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:10,640
 I don't know if that's public, but I saw a sneak peek as British fandom's chief discord opinion

349
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,080
 have her. Discordian, we might say. Yeah, no, I might like to tap into your discord knowledge for

350
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,200
 a discord. I might or might not be setting up. Would it be a discord on which people could have

351
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:30,640
 conversation? You can't see listeners cannot see John's look, which is the look of

352
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:39,200
 that bird that looks like that. There's a GIF. John is being a reaction gift right there.

353
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,680
 Yes, but yes, good stuff. Thank you to Corflu for having basically for putting something on

354
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,440
 the website. I think that is important. I note that fantasy con still hasn't segueing neatly into

355
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,800
 fantasy con, which is before our next episode. So if you're listening to this episode,

356
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,880
 fantasy con will be before you listen to our next episode. Unless I mean, that is always true. But

357
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,960
 obviously, if you're listening to this episode in like 2024, you definitely missed it. But yes,

358
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:19,680
 so it is on the weekend of the 25th and 26th of September 2021. And Farah Mendelsohn is going to

359
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:26,160
 be there representing East con 2024. And I think other East cons may also have people there to chat.

360
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,880
 I think there's going to be a shared table. Yeah, I think we have somebody there, but they're

361
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,720
 on the committee. So they're not exactly going to be chatting. Conversation will have someone there,

362
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,240
 but they will be on the committee. So they may not be super free because they may be having

363
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,360
 important con runner type conversations. But equally, if you see people you think,

364
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,280
 oh, they're probably involved with an East con, check it up and ask them. Never goes wrong.

365
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:54,960
 It is fancy con. Is it the first like UK in person con? Yes, that was far as arguments for

366
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,960
 why the East con should have a table. I really interested to know like what the vibe is. Is it

367
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,640
 going to be like, yes, we've all been released from released from COVID prison? Or is it actually

368
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,560
 going to be slightly like, I don't know, we're all now bit cautious and be very interested.

369
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,200
 I mean, obviously I'm not going. It's it's fantasy con. It's going to be a succession of business

370
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,880
 lunches. I've never entered fancy con. I thought there was world fancy con though. I thought like a

371
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:28,720
 UK fancy con was slightly less so. Farah con is also happening before next episode, but it's sold out.

372
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,200
 So none of us can go. Liz is a bit sad that she missed out on tickets. Me and Alison are less sad.

373
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,840
 No, I'm going. I have a ticket. I'm attending. It's next weekend. Yeah, I don't know if it's sold

374
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,120
 out or just they closed memberships and I forgot to buy one. It's closed. Never mind. I mean,

375
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,640
 they're probably busy anyway and I would have only gone to the fringe bits. So it's fine. Although

376
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,920
 they're not the fringe anymore. They're called bonfire, but I'm not like super sad. Just I was

377
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,360
 going to pick one up and then I forgot and then it was like, oh, they're closed. Oh,

378
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,800
 fire con memberships have closed. And so if you're hearing about fire con for the first time now,

379
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,720
 then unfortunately is too late for you to attend as Liz found to her peril. But Alison has secured

380
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:15,920
 a membership so she will be a roving octa thought reporter. I will. I think most of the stuff remains

381
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,000
 at a time zone that is is not perfect for me and I don't know how much hanging around in bars.

382
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,560
 There'll be that being my primary interest in conventions, even virtual ones. But I'm looking

383
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,800
 forward to it. And that is next weekend. Yay. Good stuff. And then the beginning of October,

384
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,000
 we have octacon, which is virtual. Yes. And the last virtual octacon was very, very good. We

385
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,880
 liberally borrowed ideas from it for the first punctuation. So if you attended punctuation and

386
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,360
 you quite like punctuation, you may quite like octacon. So I'd recommend giving it a look and

387
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:01,440
 we will put a link in the show notes. It is the weekend of the first to the third of October 2021.

388
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:13,040
 I will be on the Isle of White. We're going to do pics listeners. Pics is where every episode we

389
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:20,400
 talk about a thing we liked that was genre in the last two weeks. Every episode? Yes. We got this

390
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,280
 right. Because if we're not, if we're not able every two weeks to be like here is a thing in SF

391
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,240
 that I like, we might want to consider that we need to read more SF that we like. Or watch or play.

392
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,000
 Or watch or play. But I think if you, what, what, what if I read and watch and play lots of stuff

393
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,600
 for it's all shit? I probably do, but they're not necessarily science fiction thing. Like,

394
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,240
 I haven't actually read any science fiction books for a while. I think it's okay if you're

395
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,440
 picked not to be genre. Obviously prefer genre. Essentially, I kind of go, I don't really want

396
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,240
 to talk about something that's mediocre in genre over something that's fantastic in genre.

397
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,160
 If you're, if your choice, if your choice is between something crappy in genre and something

398
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,600
 great and not a genre, I'd go for the great. But Liz doesn't want to do pics every two weeks and

399
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,520
 I think we probably should do pics every two weeks. I think actually, oh, we can try to pick

400
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,680
 three weeks, but I mean, I think thinking about it, we can always say I have no pick this week

401
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,120
 because I've been lackadaisical. Yes, or we can always chop them out if we are running long

402
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,680
 because despite having basically no topics this week, we have just talked for an hour.

403
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,680
 Are we going to do pics? So we're going to do like a thing from the last two weeks that we've

404
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,320
 enjoyed or interacted with and we'd recommend to our listeners, usually genre. But if the thing

405
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,400
 we've listened to is, or the thing we've interacted with is not genre, then we might recommend non-genre

406
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:52,080
 things listeners prepare to have your horizons broadened. My pick this episode is the case of

407
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:58,560
 Charles Dexter Ward. Now, I know Alison has opinions about BBC podcasts and we will get to those

408
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,560
 in a second or two. But the BBC has done a podcast called the Lovecraft Investigations,

409
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,840
 where they've basically been adapting Lovecraft stories as true crime podcasts, fictional true

410
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,840
 crime podcasts. And the first one they did was the case of Charles Dexter Ward, which is a

411
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,920
 10 episode podcast you can listen to on iPlayer or I've also put the RSS in the show notes. And

412
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,160
 it was my first exposure to the story of the case of Charles Dexter Ward, and I really enjoyed it.

413
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,600
 And I've been reading the thing on the doorstep and other weird stories by HP Lovecraft, which is

414
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,560
 a penguin book that I've put links to in the show notes. And that contains the original novel.

415
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,920
 And so I have read the original novel. I find Lovecraft difficult to read because he never uses

416
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,560
 one word where 14 would do. And usually it's quite dense. I can't read it when I'm sleepy because I

417
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,200
 just fall asleep. I am glad I read it because there are a couple of bits from the podcast adaptation

418
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,480
 that I felt were a little bit unclear and made more sense having read the book. But I am glad I

419
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,160
 listened to the adaptation first actually. And yeah, I really enjoyed the adaptation. The book is fine.

420
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,720
 I think it's probably one of Lovecraft's better stories. I can see why it's one of the ones that

421
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,400
 kind of caught the public imagination. But at the same time, it is very Lovecraft. So, you know,

422
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,320
 take that with a pinch of salt. And it has all of the racism you'd expect. So, hurrah. But yeah,

423
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,640
 that's my pick. That's a thing I enjoyed this week. When I say I have opinions about podcasts,

424
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,600
 I think the I prefer in general to listen to unscripted podcasts. So the problem with

425
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,840
 podcasts from big media organizations is that they're never really unscripted. Or they go

426
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:49,280
 through multiple levels of editing for tone, which I think takes the edge off them. But actually,

427
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,000
 that sounds like doing a true crime version. Another fiction story sounds like exactly the

428
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,720
 sort of thing that they might be quite good at. So yeah. No, it was good. No. And I think

429
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,280
 you're right. Like, because the other BBC podcast I really liked is 13 minutes to the moon. But that

430
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,760
 is like, and that's nonfiction, but is much more scripted. And I think most of the podcasts I

431
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,520
 listen to tend to be more discussion unscripted. And the BBC doesn't really do that. Alison, do

432
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,480
 you have a pick? I do. So the otherwise award was announced this week. Again,

433
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,280
 Chovwe Donald-Eckpeke has won the otherwise award for Ify Yoku, the tale of Imadiyouaga Bon.

434
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,080
 The author who was actually a Facebook friend of mine, and who has been nominated for tons of

435
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:44,960
 things over the last year or two. But this is the first, first big award that they've won. And I'm

436
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:52,640
 pretty sure they're thrilled. And I'm very pleased. And it's a very interesting story. And

437
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:59,360
 when you read it, some there are places in it where if you're reading with a kind of UK or

438
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:05,360
 probably American accessibility, you go, Oh, there's some editing that didn't happen here. This is,

439
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,920
 this is not this doesn't this bit doesn't necessarily fit together with that bit in the way that you

440
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,320
 would expect. And I am telling you that you should ignore the fact that it is not copy edited perfectly

441
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,920
 because this is a great and interesting novella. And I'm very pleased to have read it. It's basically

442
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:28,160
 about a community that's kind of like Wakanda in that they've hidden away from the West.

443
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,960
 Well, the rest of the world in a post-apocalyptic situation that's very bad.

444
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:45,200
 Yeah, and it's good. Really liked it. Where can I read it? It's in an anthology, Dominion,

445
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,560
 an anthology of speculative fiction for Africa and the from Africa and the African diaspora,

446
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,280
 which you might have to buy. I'm afraid it's the thing, but you can buy it. It's easily available on

447
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,960
 all good electronic bookstores and bookstores near you. And also morally questionable ones.

448
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,280
 Well, you wouldn't want to buy from one of those, would you? It depends if you've got a Kindle or not.

449
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,360
 I do buy from the more unquestionable books, because yeah, it's a good place to buy books.

450
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,160
 Good pick. I will look that up. It looks like it costs somewhere in the region of...

451
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,120
 Is that 7 quid? It costs me about 7 quid.

452
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:26,000
 Yeah, 7 quid for the ebook or about 20 for the physical copy. And I will put links to those in

453
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,120
 the show notes. Liz, do you have a pick?

454
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:36,000
 I have been catching up on season two of Star Trek Lower Decks, which is an animated series

455
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,960
 about bunch of vensons on the USS Cerritos, which is the Federation Starship that gets all the

456
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,600
 really crap jobs to do. And it is funny and it is a chop full of Star Trek references, and it is

457
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,520
 not afraid to poke some fun at itself and all other Star Trek series. There's some very funny

458
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,720
 jokes involving a Tom Paris commemorative plate. You got a love boy. I do love a bit of a

459
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,320
 referencing. Yeah, it's basically funny. The voice acting is great. I would say it's a good solid

460
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:14,160
 bit of Star Trek, and I like that it kind of co-exists alongside Discovery, which is kind of

461
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,800
 the more serious cousin as something which is like, yeah, we're going to have a funny show.

462
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,480
 And also, if you've watched lots of Deep Space Nine, there'll be some extra jokes.

463
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,160
 I quite like that, I think it's really good. Every time we finish an episode on Amazon Prime,

464
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,520
 which is where it is in the UK, it recommends I watch Future Armor, and it does kind of feel

465
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,960
 like a Star Trek-y Futurama in a way. I think the humor is a bit more closely aligned with my

466
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,680
 humor than Futurama was. And yeah, if you'd like funny sci-fi, I would highly recommend giving it

467
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,280
 a shot. I think it's a good pick. Yes, I would say it is pretty Futurama, which for me is very high

468
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,160
 praise, and certainly like some of the background gags and things like that, and going to Futurama

469
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:03,280
 levels. Just needs more songs. I was concerned that I hadn't seen enough Star Trek to enjoy

470
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,640
 Lower Decks. I don't think that is too referential. I mean, I've seen like, movies and quite a lot of

471
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,360
 original Star Trek and various other bits of Star Trek here and there, but I'm not really

472
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:22,640
 much into Star Trek, so... I don't think... I think if you are heavily into Star Trek,

473
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,240
 there are a lot of references that will make you happy, but I don't think any of the...

474
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,800
 I don't think you need to understand the references to enjoy the show, because I think most of the

475
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:38,080
 actual jokes are not requiring of a high level of Star Trek expertise. They will be funny any...

476
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,680
 I think if you know the general tone of most of the Star Trek shows, which tend towards the

477
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,880
 tend towards the serious end of things tend to have quite a lot of worthy goals and moral dilemmas,

478
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,600
 then I think if you know that's kind of the tone of most of the live action shows,

479
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,040
 then you will get why what Lower Decks is doing is funny, even if you don't know the specifics.

480
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:08,320
 And just before two things before we go, firstly, File 770 reports that the UK has a new national

481
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:15,760
 film and science fiction museum, which James Bacon wrote a review of in File 770 and is located in

482
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:22,720
 the beautiful Milton Keynes. So if you are located near to Milton Keynes, you can go and have a look.

483
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,040
 I say science fiction, it's actually sci-fi. Some people get very annoyed by that sort of thing,

484
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,760
 but personally I don't. And then secondly, I texted my wife to say, "Should I have heard of Heathers?"

485
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,520
 And she said, "Only if you're a Gen Xer." So hello, Liz and Allison, come here, Gen Xers.

486
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,640
 I'm the young one. I was still the young one.

487
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:47,520
 It may be. I mean, I'm slightly too old to be a Gen Xer, but it's, I mean, I'm clearly Gen X

488
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,160
 because I'm too young to be a baby boomer, but I just didn't get between those two.

489
00:45:52,160 --> 00:46:00,160
 But it is kind of quintessential Gen X movie, yes. So if you want to understand how Gen X feels,

490
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,280
 Heathers is a good movie to understand that. And I would like to say I'm not in fact Gen X.

491
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,400
 I am an elder millennial, John. She wears a cape and a hood,

492
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,360
 listeners, and she chants, chants, "Eldrich things."

493
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,880
 I think I'm basically a millennial, but less f*cked over than some of the later ones, basically.

494
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,320
 I don't really believe in generations.

495
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:29,440
 And that was the 40th episode of the Octa Thought podcast, and it's goodbye from me.

496
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,240
 It's goodbye from me, and it's goodbye from me.

497
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:52,240
 [Music]

498
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,920
 What will you be doing on the Isle of Wight, John?

499
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,840
 I'm going on holiday with my parents, and we're going to have a mostly outdoor

500
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,520
 holiday, and it's quite well timed because I'm moving away from Southampton.

501
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,160
 And so exploring the Isle of Wight properly before we go is something that is good.

502
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,040
 And for those who are space nerds, which may have some overlap with science fiction nerds,

503
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,080
 the Isle of Wight is where the British rocket programme when it existed was

504
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,760
 based, and so you can go and see the old launch sites and stuff like that.

505
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,160
 And so that is one of the things I would be doing.

506
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,000
 Oh, I thought it was based in Wumara.

507
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:37,040
 So the actual launch sites for the Black Arrow, Black Arrow is the Needles, which is in the Isle of Wight.

508
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,040
 What, what's to be launched for?

509
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,160
 Well, because I don't know, it might be that they also launch from Wumara.

510
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,880
 Obviously, Wumara is harder to get to from the Isle of Wight than the Isle of Wight,

511
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,960
 being as it is in Australia.

512
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,200
 But Alison has committed to go there on her guff trip, so she can report back.

513
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,640
 There was a test launch.

514
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,400
 I mean, it may well be, it may well be that there were, there were nuclear tests, so Wumara.

515
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,160
 I didn't think Black Knight, it was tested at the Needles, but they were,

516
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,960
 they were launched in Australia, they were launched at Wumara.

517
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,960
 I mean, I, I, I was like, oh, really? Not Wumara?

518
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,280
 Let me, let me give you a link.

519
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,920
 So the rockets were, um,

520
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,400
 they were obviously not, I think we'd know if they'd be launched from the UK.

521
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,960
 I don't think, don't think we've ever launched any, and people will know.

522
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,080
 Yeah, but they, we did launch ones from the UK, it's just that they were not where the

523
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,000
 satellites were launched from, but there were rocket launches from, from the Needles.

524
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,400
 It's just that they didn't have payload, because that's how you test a rocket,

525
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,040
 you launch it and see if it blows up, and you hope it doesn't.

526
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,360
 The Black Arrow was launched from Wumara.

527
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,720
 If it's not too much trouble, they were live tested.

528
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,600
 Can we conclude a podcast and possibly our go over rocket launches at a late date?

529
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,960
 Yeah, how do you live test a rocket without launching the rocket?

530
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,680
 No, we cannot.

531
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:08,400
 No rocket, no rockets ever left the launch pad at I down, but the ship took Wumara in

532
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,760
 South Australia for launch.

533
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,440
 That's much less exciting.

534
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,960
 Us are really, and as they say, Britain is the only country in the world to have developed a

535
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,000
 successful satellite launch, but never actually, but then abandoned it, because that's a very

536
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,120
 British thing to do. But this was why I was determined to go and see Wumara at,

537
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,920
 as part of my guff trip. I mean, I was...

538
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,920
 Wumara is significantly harder to get to than the Isle of Wight.

539
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,360
 Not on a virtual trip, it's not. In fact, it might be easier to get to on a virtual trip.

540
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,160
 I don't know how easy the Isle of Wight is to do virtually, because they haven't

541
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,440
 got electricity on the internet yet. Anyway, go to the Wight.

542
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,360
 I love the bit about Wumara and the Isle of Wight, so please keep as much of that in as you can.
