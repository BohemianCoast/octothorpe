1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 I was very happy with many of the winners.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,680
 I was very happy to many of the winners.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,880
 And I was very happy with many.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,440
 Shall I try?

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,480
 No, it's John's turn to go word and edge.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,840
 Right. So he just has to think about which words he's going to gain.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,720
 I was very.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,520
 I liked it.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,040
 [Laughing]

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:41,200
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 47th episode of Octa Thorpe,

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,320
 the podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,240
 which is coming to you on the 23rd of December 2021.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,640
 I'm John Coxon.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,120
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Betty.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,960
 And we didn't read any letters of comment out last episode

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,840
 and people may have noticed this, but this time we have loads of letters of

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,880
 comment so we can read them all out.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,720
 Verbatim.

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,680
 That's a good plan.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,520
 I think that's a good plan.

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,560
 Everyone in favor?

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,960
 Well, it's verbatim.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,080
 Oh, OK.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,960
 Yeah, you do that and I'll come back in half now.

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,280
 It's good.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,160
 Farah said that Novacom didn't enforce masking and Farah said it was the worst

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,200
 farah has seen so far and farah then followed up by saying it needs to be

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,440
 compulsory in the corridors, the dealer room and the program room.

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,840
 And Fran Dowd commented saying that they were OK with Novacom's policy of

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,960
 masks pretty much everywhere except the bar area until Fran realized that by bar

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,960
 area, they didn't mean the bar, but any social space in the hotel where you could

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,880
 sit down with a drink.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,720
 And I think Fran's point is well made and quite thought about in those terms.

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,880
 That kind of follows from the discussion we were having last time.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,240
 I also got a comment from my brother saying that it was his favorite episode

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,520
 of the podcast we've done so far.

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
 So I'm glad that some people enjoyed it.

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,440
 And Jonathan Badley also wrote to us and said a long comment about masks and

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,800
 the worry of deciding whether or not to go to an event that you might be turned

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,560
 away from the door from if you didn't have the right paperwork and I have to say

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,400
 flying to Portugal felt a bit like that.

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,960
 We also had some locks from listeners, Farah, Joe Lindsey Walton and Alan

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,440
 Stroud about the BSFA.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,600
 Thank you all very much for coming on our Facebook group and having a good,

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,320
 good old discussion about that.

46
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,720
 If you are a BSFA member, you can download PDFs of all the BSFA's publications

47
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,040
 from their website and we have discovered something about BSFA membership,

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,560
 which Alison will exclusively reveal.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,560
 It turns out that you can get, even if you're in the UK, you can get a digital

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,760
 membership of the BSFA just by filling in the membership form, but putting not

51
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,040
 applicable in all the mandatory address boxes on it.

52
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,080
 And that way you'll get a digital membership because they won't be able to send

53
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,520
 you anything.

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,800
 I just recommend you don't try this with Wussless.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,080
 And that's a joke that will make more sense later in the episode.

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,440
 We also heard from listener Dave who commented that the sound on the last

57
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,960
 episode was a little bit iffy.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,360
 I think I put it right as Alison podcasting from the bottom of a well.

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,960
 We apologise for this.

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,160
 It's basically because now we are allowed to leave our homes again.

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,880
 We have to get used to doing some recordings in one of our optimal usual

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,720
 podcast spots.

63
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,440
 So we are working on it for future episode.

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,920
 I need to correct Liz there where when she said now that we're able to leave

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,560
 our homes, what she meant is during the brief interregnum when we were able to

66
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,440
 leave our homes.

67
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,520
 Do not think about the event.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,040
 Chris Garcia wrote a wonderful episode, lots of Chewiness, which is good.

69
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,720
 We're glad that you chewed on our episode.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,160
 We hope that all episodes will be equally nourishing.

71
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,640
 Chris says on the topic of Covid in cons that he

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,680
 thinks there's a lot of danger with having in person conventions and he says, so

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,320
 John tell us by the way, she's right.

74
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,880
 I try and avoid telling us by the way, because it gives her leverage, Chris.

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,080
 But she might hear this podcast is one of my best efforts.

76
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,760
 And he also notes that it's hard to do test at the door in the US because at

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,400
 home tests cost 15 bucks for two, which seems too expensive.

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,200
 I mean, it would seem too expensive, even if it was 50 cents for two, but 15 bucks

79
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,320
 for two is is daft.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
 Yes, free testing.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,760
 It's a basic of public health.

82
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,320
 Who knew?

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,880
 He also says that he's had by his count more than a dozen

84
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,640
 concussions since he was two.

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,440
 He almost certainly has CTE.

86
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,920
 What's a CTE stand for?

87
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,200
 Liz.

88
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,000
 Oh, I need to look it up.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,880
 It's, but I think it's, um, it's what everyone in the NFL has, basically.

90
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,760
 It stands for chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

91
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,960
 Fair enough. And he says they can only know for sure if he does by dissecting his

92
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,680
 brain. So he's going to wait to get that done.

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,160
 He thinks sorry to hear that Chris.

94
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,560
 It's basically my fear is I hit myself on the head until I can no longer think

95
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,720
 or do anything.

96
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,440
 Um, but hopefully that won't happen.

97
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,320
 Hurrah.

98
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,800
 He doesn't have a recorder for tapes anymore, but he'll run Oct thought through

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,720
 his voice to text converter, a mail, John Hurt to copy.

100
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,880
 So thank you very much for that.

101
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,720
 Chris, that would be very helpful.

102
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,400
 I'm not sure John Hurt is going to thank us for an auto transcribed version of

103
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:27,920
 Octa thought.

104
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,120
 It's going to be very confused.

105
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,760
 Chris then says at the end, got to say it's an interesting time to be a convention

106
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:46,800
 fan. And that segues neatly into worse, first and world cons site selection news.

107
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,880
 At Smothcon, I think people still thought that Cheng do and not got that many votes

108
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,360
 in and it was all going to be fine.

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,640
 And what happened after that was that the Cheng do bid helped by the biggest

110
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,240
 science fiction magazine in China ran a live stream for eight consecutive nights

111
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
 where they got every science fiction celebrity in China and then also some

112
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,440
 recordings from people around the world on their live stream and had thousands

113
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,000
 upon thousands of science fiction fans in China, mostly students watching it

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,640
 and chatting all the way through and saying how marvelous Cheng do was and

115
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:31,000
 voting and those people bought supporting memberships of the world con and voting

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,360
 tokens and voted and in total, there were a lot of votes and Cheng do one.

117
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,600
 And this is the bit where Liz can put in.

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:49,000
 But in the meantime, yes, 106,000 views on this stream on the SFW magazine house

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,120
 did one when people think, well, that's a lot of votes.

120
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,400
 Emilie Arrow said, and I thought this was very pertinent that when Helsinki was

121
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,560
 bidding, they got 200 fins to join and vote.

122
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,440
 And that was about 20 times as effective as the Cheng do bid was when you compare

123
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,800
 relative populations of China and Finland.

124
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,200
 So I'm going to also have to probably explain a little bit about how

125
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,360
 site selection works if you have not voted in world con site selection.

126
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,120
 Essentially, so you can vote before the con and those votes were emailed to the

127
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,600
 site selection admin and you could pay through the discount website, basically.

128
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,040
 So on the first evening before world con, traditionally, the bids will send

129
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,880
 in some tellers who will start looking at those votes in order, usually to declare

130
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,280
 whether the vote is a valid vote or not, separate the address from the actual vote.

131
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,640
 And then those votes can be counted later with all the votes that happen on site

132
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,000
 where this separation happens during the voting process.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,200
 And the first interesting happened here was that Kevin Stanley, who was one of the

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,320
 Winnipeg bid representatives, posted a breakdown of the country of origin of all

135
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,560
 the voters in the pre voting, which was an unusual step.

136
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,320
 It showed there was a huge majority of Chinese votes and then votes were about

137
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,360
 17 other countries.

138
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,120
 And there was some basically can fuff around this because this was not normal

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,720
 practice.

140
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,280
 And so the numbers were actually taken down because you could you could

141
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,320
 invest in two ways actually.

142
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,600
 I mean, you could infer that it would give Winnipeg a very strong kind of get out

143
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,880
 the vote rationale, but you could also interpret it.

144
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,000
 The people would then go actually China has a massive lead.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,920
 There's no point me voting.

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,280
 So I don't need a sporting membership in a Chinese welcome, but they got taken down.

147
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,680
 But I thought the interesting thing then was that they did not split the address

148
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
 information from the votes at that time.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,160
 So when all the stuff about Kevin emerged, at first people just kind of, this

150
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,840
 seems a bit off, especially people from from Europe.

151
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:57,760
 But when the full ramifications emerged, Kevin was released from his roles, both

152
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,840
 as one of the official tellers for Winnipeg, but also as the chair of the

153
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,960
 Wusswuss business meeting for the convention, which does raise the question

154
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,280
 of why somebody who's working for one of the bids was the chair of the business

155
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,840
 meeting, though he wasn't planning to chair the site selection section of the

156
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,520
 business meeting.

157
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,400
 But still, there is an issue about how you separate these roles that I think

158
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,640
 Wusswuss would do well to consider for future World Cons.

159
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,560
 Then anyway, there's a part two to the story.

160
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
 Yes, there is a part two.

161
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,520
 So I should say like, I have no reason to disbelieve that Kevin who said he would

162
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,720
 recuse himself from any site selection business would do that.

163
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,960
 But I'm not sure if there is a mechanism by which that can actually happen to the

164
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,200
 chair of the business meeting.

165
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,440
 And so it all relies very much on kind of goodwill and trust.

166
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,400
 And that may also have been a problem with what happened next to business

167
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,600
 meetings. So then at the Friday business meeting, a motion appeared.

168
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,560
 So I was sort of, I came into business meeting, I was watching it virtually a bit

169
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,640
 late and I came in and they were debating a motion.

170
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,000
 And I eventually saw the text of the motion on Twitter, which was essentially

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 business meeting believes that site selection votes should have membership

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,200
 number, name, signature and address.

173
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
 It really said, or and then was amended to and the one that went around on Twitter

174
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,520
 has the names of the Winnipeg picture and vice chair on it.

175
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,120
 Although I'm told that when it was actually introduced, it was introduced by the

176
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,280
 site selection administrator.

177
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,480
 And it was just a very strange moment because these are people who are, you know,

178
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,720
 intimately involved in site selection and in wanting their bid to win,

179
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,680
 introducing a resolution, wanting the business meeting to rule on how the vote

180
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,000
 should be counted, kind of in the middle of the actual voting process.

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,080
 But it was in the middle of the actual voting process, but at a point when it

182
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,120
 massively favored those who could still vote in person, who were mostly going to

183
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,680
 be in favor of the Winnipeg bid, the arguments for and against at the business

184
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,120
 meeting, no one seemed to have a good argument for why it had been introduced.

185
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
 Now, I never stepped up and said clearly, this is why we need the business meeting

186
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
 to take a ruling on this.

187
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,520
 And then in fact, I'm not sure why the business meeting should be taking

188
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,440
 ruling on it anyway.

189
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,360
 And eventually it's sort of, you know, there were the debate happened.

190
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,120
 At one point, the chair of the business meeting got the vice chair of the

191
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,040
 business meeting to take over so that he could speak in favor of the

192
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
 the motion, which also seemed extremely strange.

193
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,840
 And then it was voted through.

194
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,440
 But it's a non binding resolution, which did not find the site selection

195
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,280
 administrator to follow it at all.

196
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,520
 So it was just a very kind of strange half an hour.

197
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,320
 And I still don't really know what they hope to accomplish with it.

198
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,080
 I believe I have an explanation from that for having had several

199
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,320
 conversations with Smoughs, who I like and generally respect quite a lot, but

200
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,520
 think might have been somewhat misguided, or their friends might have been

201
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,560
 somewhat misguided in this case.

202
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,840
 And what it was was that quite a lot of people having realized that there were

203
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,920
 all these Chinese bids that had only email addresses and not street addresses,

204
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,200
 which we now discover is completely 100% the norm in China.

205
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,560
 Thought it was important for this to be drawn to the attention of the

206
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,480
 business meeting.

207
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,320
 And then they did it in this way that was not necessarily very clever.

208
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,440
 But the head of site selection wanted to get a sense of the view of the

209
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,240
 business meeting before making a final call on that.

210
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,360
 And I think eventually he also got, well, they also got a view on the, the

211
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
 feeling of the internet.

212
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,560
 And that's not.

213
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,160
 When I say the feeling of the internet, I don't mean Twitter went bananas,

214
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,440
 but Twitter did go bananas.

215
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,880
 But also a lot of the people who would have been in that room, but can't,

216
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,360
 because let my, what I remind you was for still has no arrangement for

217
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,240
 remote participation, even though it's obvious that they need one, even the

218
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,760
 people who would dearly have loved to be in that room, but were prevented from

219
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,240
 say, not having their visa accepted or having, or being worried about plague,

220
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,240
 couldn't participate in this directly.

221
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,120
 But so those were a lot of the people who were pitching in.

222
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,720
 There was an extremely good post, which I'm afraid is friends locked by Colin

223
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,840
 Harris, for example, where he, he went through a lot of his feelings about this

224
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,440
 resolution.

225
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,080
 And, and there was a lot of informed comment there and in a number of other

226
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,440
 places around the internet.

227
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,640
 So it wasn't just everyone, everyone lost their collective.

228
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,920
 What do we say when people are losing collective things and we're a family

229
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,760
 family podcast?

230
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,040
 Everyone got a little bit cross.

231
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,240
 A number of people got a little bit cross on the internet.

232
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,560
 But it was also a lot of very considered reaction from people who, who thought

233
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,360
 this was really way out of order.

234
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,360
 And then eventually the site selection head meant, yeah, no, I've decided

235
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,680
 that these, these votes are valid.

236
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,840
 And it all came out all right in the end provided that all right in the end

237
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,800
 includes having a Chinese Worldcon.

238
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,640
 But I mean, I mean, I voted for Winnipeg.

239
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,000
 I campaigned for Winnipeg.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,680
 I didn't want that to be a Chinese Worldcon by preference, but I, you know,

241
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,640
 they, they did win.

242
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,080
 I feel like it's okay.

243
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,920
 They've got the Worldcon.

244
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,840
 We just need to make it the best Worldcon it can be now.

245
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,520
 Yeah.

246
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,280
 So I think, I think in general, one of the things that got said was the reason

247
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,280
 that this resolution was brought was not necessarily because the site

248
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,880
 selection administrator wanted to be bound by the business meeting, but because

249
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,560
 they wanted a steer from the community.

250
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,240
 I think the other thing that is relatively apparent is if you read the

251
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,640
 relevant part of the was just constitution, it is not in fact designed to

252
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,000
 exclude votes that do not have all of the contact information on them.

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,520
 And I generally think if that clause in the constitution is going to be

254
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,760
 interpreted thusly, we probably need to take postal addresses off or make it

255
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,680
 clear that they are an exception because I don't necessarily see the benefit of

256
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,120
 everyone giving their postal address to a Worldcon.

257
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,400
 So I don't necessarily want the Worldcon to be able to mail me.

258
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,640
 I think in the end, it became apparent that the Chinese votes for Chengdu

259
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,800
 were real votes from actual science fiction fans and should probably have

260
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,720
 been counted.

261
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,640
 It did come out at the site selection meeting that if they had followed the

262
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,560
 resolution passed by the business meeting, we're going to pay a good of one

263
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,800
 because the majority of the votes from China had not got complete address

264
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,040
 information on, but it turns out that may well be a cultural thing because

265
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,160
 apparently telephroad is a big problem in China.

266
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,400
 And one of the ways to reduce your risk of that is not to give your address

267
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,960
 out to people via PDF emails on the internet.

268
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,200
 Yeah, I have a couple more points here.

269
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,760
 The actual point that they were relying on in the constitution says site

270
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,120
 selection balance should include name signature address and membership

271
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,280
 number spaces to be filled in by the voter.

272
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,080
 I don't know about the people in the was was business meeting, but I live in

273
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,280
 2021, and I don't think many people on the planet think that would have

274
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,080
 automatically assumed that the word address means mailing address.

275
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,760
 I mean, I think it's a bit like saying phone means a device that it has

276
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,880
 attached to the wall and makes telephone calls.

277
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,120
 I'm also concerned that although the instructions for filling in the ballot

278
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,280
 were in Chinese, the ballot was in English and the Chinese instructions are

279
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,280
 very unlikely to have specified mailing address, I think I suspect.

280
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,080
 And of course, the was was constitution is not in Chinese.

281
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,480
 And this feels to me to be it would have been deeply unfair to have concluded

282
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,040
 that what was required there was full mailing address, which seems again,

283
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,840
 makes me quite surprised that the business meeting did.

284
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,720
 And again, I think it's it's it just speaks about how monocultural the

285
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,920
 business meeting is, especially this year.

286
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,200
 This year in particular, when a lot of people from around the world who

287
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,880
 normally have been in that room couldn't be there, you do have a group of people

288
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,520
 who are mostly white, mostly elderly, mostly American.

289
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,360
 And I think that was what caused that outcome.

290
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,640
 And props to Ben Yellow, the guest of honour at Discon 3, who spoke

291
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,000
 loudly and determinedly against the motion.

292
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,920
 Go Ben.

293
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,800
 Yes, I will also.

294
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,680
 So just one other thing I've got an anecdote, which is I asked my friend.

295
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,200
 I said, what's your how do I send you mail these days?

296
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,680
 And he said, his magime address.

297
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,400
 And I was like, I did I meant post.

298
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,760
 I didn't mean email, but he read the word mail and interpreted it to mean email.

299
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,880
 And he is like older than me.

300
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,160
 So I think that is a shift that is happening.

301
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,240
 And the fact it doesn't specify address.

302
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,240
 But also I will note there's nothing in the was first constitution that says

303
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,560
 here is what makes a ballot valid.

304
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,040
 There's nothing at all that says this is the criteria.

305
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,200
 And so if the ballot says this is what makes the ballot valid, as far as I can see,

306
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,120
 the was first constitution doesn't say what the convention has to take as that.

307
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,400
 So making arguments based on the constitution just seems silly.

308
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,640
 And if the ballot says here is what makes the ballot valid, then you go with that.

309
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,160
 You don't.

310
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,400
 I just don't see there's a leg to stand on here.

311
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,280
 I think the only thing you achieve by lodging this is that it looks like you're

312
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,000
 trying to fill the vote.

313
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And I think that, you know, that's bad.

314
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,560
 So I was glad that it did not work.

315
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,240
 Yeah.

316
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,760
 So my thought on all of this is, you know, it sounds like there may have been

317
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,040
 some good valid intentions behind it.

318
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,080
 In the end, it has worked out because those votes were not eliminated, which I

319
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,400
 think is the correct move.

320
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,720
 And so Chengdu won by having more votes.

321
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,360
 But it just strikes me as, yeah, again, like we have burned another massive

322
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,440
 amount of goodwill.

323
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,360
 We have looked like whispers kind of have to, you know,

324
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,080
 finger on the scale and are trying to swing ballots.

325
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,240
 I think we really need to be aware of kind of how this looks to the outside

326
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,960
 world looking.

327
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,920
 It's not just important to kind of discuss it with those 80 people in the

328
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,000
 business meeting because there might not be people participating virtually,

329
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
 but there are sure are people watching virtually.

330
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,120
 And I think it's, yeah, it's just important that you and you're going to

331
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,480
 bring these motions, which look very much like you are trying to say, will the

332
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,880
 business meeting approve of me throwing out like all these votes and therefore

333
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,240
 when it ends up winning?

334
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,120
 I think you just have to be very aware of how this looks for people viewing

335
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,840
 virtually who may also not be able to turn to their neighbor and say, what is

336
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,480
 going on in this business meeting?

337
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,880
 Because they don't quite understand the procedure, which is what I have done a lot

338
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,640
 in the very few in person business meetings I've been to, you know, things

339
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,360
 like it was a resolution, but it was not at all kind of clear what the difference

340
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,240
 is to the average viewer, maybe between a resolution and a constitutional amendment,

341
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,040
 things like that.

342
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,760
 Yes.

343
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,440
 And I think all of the British people heard the words, not binding resolution and

344
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,160
 had a kind of sudden shutter to their souls.

345
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,320
 I did want to make one more point about this, which is this is how indirect

346
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,200
 racism works.

347
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,120
 You do things that you do not think are biased, but nevertheless, you introduce

348
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,560
 a massive amount of bias.

349
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,320
 In this case, that you go business, the business meeting did not know the

350
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,280
 balance of votes.

351
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,160
 So they did things in a way that they did not believe was biased, but it was.

352
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,240
 In general, I am quite happy that the bid that attracted the most votes was the

353
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
 bid that was the seated world con.

354
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,000
 I think that is good.

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,640
 And I think that is how it should work.

356
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,960
 I am a little bit concerned about some aspects of China hosting a world con.

357
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,160
 And I think I try to thread this needle because there was a point of which at the

358
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,920
 third Thursday, where I was like, well, I was very pro widder peg.

359
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,120
 And then everyone on my side turned out to be a little bit of a giant racist.

360
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,360
 And now I'm a bit like, Oh, no, am I a baddie?

361
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,080
 But I think in general, it should not be the case that people interpret our

362
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,440
 gladness that the wisvers procedures worked in a sort of democratic and fairway

363
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,600
 as gladness that the world cons States of China.

364
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,080
 And I'm not going to talk about it too much because I think probably at this

365
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,360
 point in a Western country, everyone's very familiar with the reasons.

366
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,840
 We're a little bit nervous about, you know, to Chinese government and et cetera.

367
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,360
 But I am going to link to Jeanette Ng's Twitter thread.

368
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,240
 Jeanette used to live in Hong Kong and therefore has a quite personal

369
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,400
 perspective on this as a British SF fan who used to live in a territory, which

370
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,440
 is controlled by China.

371
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,680
 And so I will link to that in the show notes.

372
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,480
 Yeah, I went.

373
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,080
 I have also moved on this issue because I went from being a firm Winnipeg

374
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,320
 supporter who was really worried about China getting the welcome to being

375
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,520
 some of the viewers met and chatted to quite a lot of Chinese fans and is now

376
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:41,360
 quite excited about the idea of all of those incredibly excitable students who

377
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,240
 are amazed by science fiction and thrilled by it, getting a world kind of of

378
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,360
 their own to go to.

379
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,080
 And I think that will be great.

380
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,800
 And I understand that that may mean that some of the people who regularly go to

381
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,120
 Worldcon can't go and that's a shame for them, but you don't get to go to

382
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,360
 Worldcon every year and they never get to Worldcon.

383
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,720
 So, you know, yeah, Liz, do you have anything on, you know, the Chinese state?

384
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,800
 No, fair enough.

385
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,960
 Yeah, I think I've been, you know, interacting a little bit with the

386
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,320
 Chengdu bid on Discord.

387
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,440
 What I think is actually more obvious to me now and that I didn't realise is

388
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,520
 that it was phenomenally hard for them to vote in site selection.

389
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,240
 Because this con had to stop accepting their main payment method.

390
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,920
 They don't all have credit cards can use internationally.

391
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,760
 You know, the ballot is not translated.

392
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,480
 So you've got to basically try and fill in an English language PDF and sign it

393
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,200
 and send it back.

394
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,960
 And that might be the reason as well why they're apparently 917 voting

395
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,800
 tokens that were bought, but no votes associated with them, which isn't

396
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,320
 unusually high number.

397
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,000
 I mean, that is a lot of money that was spent on voting tokens with no vote.

398
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,800
 So it'd be interesting to know kind of why those voting tokens were bought

399
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,080
 and then never voted.

400
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,400
 Is it that they were bought and people thought they'd sent their vote in, but

401
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,400
 actually they hadn't managed to vote at all or they managed to double buy tokens?

402
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,120
 It's kind of interesting that obviously something was going on there that meant

403
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,320
 a thousand people tried to buy tokens and vote and didn't manage to vote.

404
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,480
 I mean, I think it is quite likely that other people were buying tokens in the

405
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,760
 end because of this thing about the students not having any way to buy directly.

406
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,480
 I mean, I'm assuming that Chengdu will sort it out.

407
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,400
 I think so.

408
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,000
 My final thoughts on site selection are that every kind of previous overseas

409
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,240
 WorldCom bid has had to do a lot of outreach in order to get people to vote for it.

410
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,320
 And what is clear from Chengdu is that they just have a sufficiently large

411
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,880
 group of fans out there, but actually they don't really need to do any outreach at all.

412
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:50,240
 They can just win a Chinese WorldCom entirely with votes from Chinese fans, which are

413
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,200
 in a different situation than we've been in before.

414
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,640
 At the site selection business meeting, when Chengdu won, they announced their guests of honour,

415
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,960
 who were Liu Sershin, Sergey Lukianenko and Robert J. Sawyer.

416
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,920
 This has attracted some comment because obviously those are all male guests of honour.

417
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,520
 And some people have wondered why there may not be a female guest of honour.

418
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:23,120
 And I think it is true that they could stand to invite a female guest of honour later down the road.

419
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,840
 Yeah, I mean, I expect they'll have more guests and I'm sure there'll be women on that list.

420
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,080
 It was either very clever of them to have a Canadian guest of honour, or as a kind of olive

421
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,120
 bratch to Winnipeg, or it's just luck.

422
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,600
 But I think it's quite a good move.

423
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:45,800
 There have also been some criticisms of the choice of Sergey Lukianenko as the guest of honour.

424
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,200
 It's not anything I was aware of personally, but there have been some criticism of his

425
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,520
 opinions on Russian sections in Georgia and the Ukraine.

426
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,680
 And the only things I've seen are now quite historic.

427
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,240
 So they're kind of from 2008, but I haven't seen anything further on whether these are kind of,

428
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,880
 you know, opinions he still holds.

429
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,280
 So this came up instantly after he was selected as a guest of honour raised by fans from the area.

430
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,320
 It's a concern across a broader area than just Ukraine.

431
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,200
 Our friend, friend of the show, Marcin was pretty horrified by that announcement.

432
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,280
 They've got a very cute panda bid logo and panda convention logo.

433
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,920
 And I do look forward to seeing all the different kind of varieties of their panda logo we get over the next couple of years.

434
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,880
 I'm looking forward to their branding.

435
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,640
 I believe they are currently having discussions about what the name of the convention should be.

436
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,120
 I'm kind of like, maybe they should have those discussions before winning the bid.

437
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,960
 [Phone ringing]

438
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,280
 The Hugo Awards were announced.

439
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,120
 We don't have the full statistical breakdown yet, so we can't go proper nerdy.

440
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,760
 Expect that next week as we are all proper nerds.

441
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,440
 But we did get the actual list of who won and Liz went to the ceremony.

442
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,360
 So Liz, do you want to talk about that?

443
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,800
 Yes, I could watch the ceremony.

444
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,360
 It was actually delayed by an hour for either some smoke or a fire or something.

445
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
 They said there was no fire.

446
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,320
 And then they said there was, however, an electrical fault and quite a lot of smoke.

447
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,760
 And you know what they say about smoke.

448
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,720
 So, but they own.

449
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,000
 So the Hugo started 75 minutes late, but it was fine.

450
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,680
 Yes, I mean, that seems reasonable if you had electrical fault.

451
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,960
 And I'm quite grateful because I woke up what would have been about 40 minutes into the Hugo's.

452
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,960
 And it turns out that it was like half an hour before they started, which was perfect.

453
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,040
 So yes, I watched the Hugo ceremony, which was emptied by Shirei Renee Thomas and Andrea Heston,

454
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,080
 as Malca Older had to unfortunately withdraw.

455
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,280
 And it was pretty good.

456
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:58,560
 I mean, yeah, it was just a very competently done Hugo ceremony, basically.

457
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
 It ran roughly to time.

458
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,120
 It had some jokes.

459
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,560
 It had some excellent moments from Thomas and Heston, who they referred to, EG, the renaming

460
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,400
 of the astounding award and how that reflects our future.

461
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,280
 There were some good speeches from some of the winners.

462
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,600
 I really like seeing the fire magazine team on stage.

463
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,240
 Maria Devana Headley did a great speech for Beowulf, including saying how she was wearing a necklace

464
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,000
 that she could not have worn in person because it would get tangled up.

465
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,480
 So she had to remotely.

466
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:39,520
 They segued neatly between live acceptances, pre-recorded acceptances, and live acceptances over Zoom.

467
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,840
 I think there were live acceptances over Zoom, and that worked really well and very smoothly.

468
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,640
 You know, we had some music.

469
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,640
 They had a choir singing during the in memoriam.

470
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,680
 It basically was all just kind of very smooth and very nice.

471
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,920
 And then I enjoyed watching it.

472
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,640
 The only slight hit was they accidentally didn't play the recorded acceptance speech

473
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,800
 from Best Video Game until later.

474
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,400
 But they just came back and tossed it in.

475
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,560
 You know, no fuss.

476
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,360
 Yeah.

477
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,920
 So I enjoyed watching it.

478
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,360
 I'm pretty happy with all the winners.

479
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,680
 It was a pretty good Hugo ceremony.

480
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,440
 And it was kind of what was needed because last year's Hugo ceremony, you know, we were all

481
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,000
 sitting there.

482
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,920
 Those of us watching it live going.

483
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,200
 What's going on here?

484
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,360
 Is this really what I think it is?

485
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,760
 And, you know, those were watching it live this time.

486
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,320
 We're pretty much like, yeah, this is pretty good with the exception of, you know, some

487
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,480
 Albrecht eyebrow raising when they said it was sponsored by Raytheon Corporation.

488
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,680
 But apart from that, I think everything was was pretty good.

489
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,240
 I was very happy with many of the winners.

490
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,240
 I was particularly happy to see fire when best semi-prosine.

491
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,640
 I think that's very richly deserved.

492
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,760
 And I also think it is good when you have different things winning in a category.

493
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,400
 And I think unbroken streaks of many years are perhaps a bad sign.

494
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,600
 So particularly happy see that.

495
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,720
 I was also generally very pleased with the other winners.

496
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,680
 And yeah, I in general was very happy to read read the results and congratulations

497
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,240
 to Cooed Street for winning Best Fancast, eight time finalist and first time winners

498
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
 and richly deserved.

499
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,720
 And I do think that their work in 2020 was some of the best work they've done.

500
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,440
 So I think richly deserved at the moment as well.

501
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,360
 They were my top pick and I was very pleased to see them.

502
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,600
 But and congratulations to Alison for her victory because Hades won.

503
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,440
 Oh, yeah.

504
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,280
 And she must be over the moon.

505
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:43,360
 I tweeted out to Greg this morning and said, Oh, I could not say in all those

506
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,240
 emails about the Hugo Boat packet.

507
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,080
 Oh, it incidentally, I've played your game for 300 hours.

508
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,120
 But I think it's OK to fess up there.

509
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,280
 So I was very pleased to see Hades win.

510
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,560
 I would have been pleased.

511
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,920
 I mean, I was generally pleased that obviously not everything I voted for one.

512
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,200
 But there were several categories where I was extremely pleased.

513
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,440
 I was very pleased to see Beowulf win because whether or not you think it was

514
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,400
 eligible, it was at least a thing that is a work.

515
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,120
 You want to say something about it?

516
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,400
 It's nice to see a long substantial work win because we've had a run of blog posts

517
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
 and shorter things.

518
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:24,880
 Yeah, no, I kind of what I am concerned by the trend for things that are kind of about

519
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,720
 conventions, winning, invest related work.

520
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,760
 And so it's quite nice to see something that is clearly a best related work, winning it.

521
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,480
 And also Beowulf, that translation of Beowulf is unbelievably fantastic.

522
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,800
 And if you have not read it, if you have any interest at all in the history of fantasy,

523
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,400
 it is well worth your time.

524
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,760
 I was also pleased to see the old God win for the simple reason that it was the

525
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,080
 first time that the full that the full length best dramatic presentation, long form

526
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,040
 finalists has been included in a huger voter packet.

527
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,440
 And so I don't know whether it was correlated in any way, but I was glad to see it win for that reason.

528
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,680
 So if you're out there and you make movies, put them in the voter packet, it works.

529
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
 We have clear evidence.

530
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,920
 I noticed that because I just assumed I'd go and watch on Netflix.

531
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,880
 Ah, interesting.

532
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,000
 I will immediately counter that with the news that the only thing in the packet

533
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,920
 from best dramatic presentation, short form, did not win.

534
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,480
 So, you know, sorry.

535
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,960
 John, get out here with your logic.

536
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,400
 I will also say, apparently Eurovision song contest did better than Tenet.

537
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,280
 And I think Tenet has many flaws, but I am not sure I think it deserved to come

538
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
 behind Eurovision.

539
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,920
 OK, can I give you a theory on this, which is that a lot of Hugo voters are quite

540
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,200
 old and Tenet is impossible to understand in the cinema and was not available on

541
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,920
 streaming during the voting period.

542
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,600
 Yeah, I mean, you probably probably both of those are very big contributing factors.

543
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,360
 You have to have subtitles.

544
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,000
 It's not comparable to old people without subtitles.

545
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,520
 I mean, I think it's also an effect of the, you know, the way voting works to determine

546
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,600
 second to fourth, fifth place is that, you know, often the thing which has, you know,

547
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:22,360
 a very big number of first place votes and then becomes one of the last two in the

548
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,800
 run off, then doesn't end up in second place because of redistribution.

549
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,080
 So, you know, Tenet could be, I'll just actually go and find the numbers because

550
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,480
 I've got them right in front of me.

551
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,360
 I mean, in Tenet's case, actually, it was like at the bottom of the pile from the start.

552
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,880
 So it never looked like it had even a chance.

553
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,080
 There are more people who put the original song contest actually in this first

554
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,160
 preference than Tenet.

555
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,120
 So it was never in the chance.

556
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,760
 I think it is noticeable that the total participation in the Hugo's this year was

557
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,560
 two thousand, three hundred and sixty two ballots.

558
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,680
 And there is a clause in the Wussfuss Constitution, which says you have to get at

559
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:05,360
 least 25% of the total ballots to vote in a category for that category to be awarded.

560
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,960
 And I think it is worth pointing out that some categories are actually running

561
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,200
 quite close to that number, that bottom limit of ballots, in particular, some of the

562
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,240
 fan categories.

563
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,240
 And I guess particularly relevant to Octa Thorpe is there were 643 632 votes in

564
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,960
 fan cast this year and 25% of that total ballot is 590.

565
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,360
 So if 42 fewer people had voted in best fan cast, it would not have been awarded.

566
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,560
 So I think this does speak to some need to try and raise the profile of the fan

567
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,160
 awards a little bit, because I think, you know, they're good awards.

568
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,280
 I think that the investment of time you need to look at the nominees and decide

569
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,760
 which one to vote for is not huge, especially compared to something like best

570
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,800
 series, for instance.

571
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,960
 And maybe we can try and raise a little bit more interest in that and get a little

572
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,640
 bit more votes going in those categories, just because I think that fan cast,

573
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,920
 especially, was starting to come close to the lower limit.

574
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,760
 And that segues tidally into the other thing I want to say, which is that I was

575
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,160
 absolutely thrilled that Sarah Felix, one best fan artist, for many reasons.

576
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:15,320
 She's done fantastic work on many fanzies this year across a whole spectrum of

577
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,560
 different sorts of fanzine.

578
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,000
 And she's the bid artist for the Glasgow in 2024 bid, but more than anything else,

579
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,160
 she has done the artwork for my for the next issue of my tiny fanzine, which we'll

580
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,200
 put a link to in the show notes. And you can't see the bit she's done yet because

581
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,160
 it hasn't come out yet.

582
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:39,160
 But when it does come out, it's an exact evocation of why she is the right person

583
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,800
 to be winning the best fan artist Hugo.

584
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,880
 And I was absolutely thrilled.

585
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,640
 Jon, do you have a lot to say on the hugas?

586
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,760
 I don't think I do.

587
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,680
 I do.

588
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,080
 Sorry.

589
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,760
 Someone gave me a spreadsheet full of statistics.

590
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,920
 Obviously, I have things to say.

591
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,000
 I was just also going to say, I was also going to say that, you know, best video

592
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,320
 game was, you know, discons, choice to award this year as an experiment.

593
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,160
 And I think had, you know, a very credible list of finalists as we've discussed before,

594
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,480
 but it also had, you know, it had 40% of ballots that were cast filled in best

595
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,160
 video game.

596
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,960
 So this is not something that has been chosen by a tiny number of voters.

597
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,600
 There was also a reasonable voting contingent in this category.

598
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,920
 So it all bodes quite well for future conventions or future business meetings,

599
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,560
 which we still introduce a best video game Hugo.

600
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,200
 The best video game Hugo is currently in the Hugo Awards Study Committee,

601
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,160
 which was described to me this weekend as where Hugo Awards go to die.

602
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,600
 Didn't we send best audio book off to the Hugo Study Committee?

603
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,040
 Oh, yes.

604
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,600
 So it might be a few years.

605
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:50,440
 Pics, do you want to start?

606
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,840
 Me or who?

607
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,360
 You.

608
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
 Or whom?

609
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:00,080
 My pick for this episode is the Psychopath Club by Sandra Bond, which follows the

610
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:07,120
 adventures of Daryl Martock, who is a kid living in a small American town and

611
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,520
 very much not enjoying himself.

612
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,120
 The tagline for the book is he's a good kid.

613
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,560
 He just wants to kill you.

614
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,880
 And I think the touchstone people might be familiar with that will get them into

615
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,560
 the right frame of mind for this book is probably the wasp factory by Ian Banks.

616
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,880
 It reminded me very powerfully of that, but I think I probably enjoyed it a bit

617
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,160
 more than the wasp factory and it's definitely more genre than the wasp factory.

618
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,000
 I really enjoyed it.

619
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,640
 It didn't do any of the things that I expected it to do at any point.

620
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,760
 And I was very unsure where it was going at most of the points that I was

621
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,880
 reading, which I really thoroughly enjoyed.

622
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,680
 And yeah, I would recommend everyone go read it.

623
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,320
 It is available on Kindle for not much money or for about £12 in paperback.

624
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,920
 If you don't have a Kindle, but you want an ebook version, you can convert

625
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,200
 the Kindle version in an app called Caliber and just ping me a message and I

626
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,280
 can walk you through how to do that.

627
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,720
 But yeah, I think it is fantastic and everyone should read it.

628
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,360
 So maybe Sandra is a great new voice in science fiction and everyone should

629
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,320
 read her book.

630
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,920
 So my choice is a book, I think we're all doing books this time.

631
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,520
 I booked a recent read, which is The Witness for the Dead by Catherine Addison.

632
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,960
 It is a sequel of sorts to the Goblin Emperor, although I think it would stand

633
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,640
 alone reasonably well, although you're going to be confused about some of the

634
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,320
 world building.

635
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:39,080
 And it follows one of the characters who's introduced in the Goblin Emperor,

636
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,440
 Merselahart, who is a witness for the dead.

637
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,080
 Essentially, he's a religious man who's kind of calling is to be a witness for the

638
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,680
 dead in that he can kind of commune with the dead and he called and pawn a lot

639
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,080
 for things like investigating possible murders or suicides to clear up issues

640
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,760
 with wills to this kind of thing.

641
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:09,800
 Anyway, it kind of follows him in the town he has now moved to, where he's

642
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:18,040
 investigating several different cases, sort of some murders, some wills.

643
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,960
 And also he's dealing with his status and how he fits into the power structures.

644
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,520
 And I very much liked it because I like the Goblin Emperor and this gives us a

645
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,080
 kind of totally different view of that world because the Goblin Emperor follows

646
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,920
 the new Emperor, as you'd expect.

647
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,200
 And this one is much more kind of on the ground and is someone who is living

648
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,280
 essentially sort of lower middle-class life in a working town.

649
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,280
 And a lot of his investigations kind of do follow the class structures,

650
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,360
 places he can go essentially because maybe he crosses class boundaries as

651
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,080
 his member of the priesthood.

652
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:58,200
 He's investigating the death of an opera singer who had kind of upper-class

653
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,600
 patrons and lovers and what was going on there.

654
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,320
 And the character himself is pretty great and fun to spend time with.

655
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
 So yeah, I really enjoyed it.

656
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,720
 It finishes a little bit kind of precipitously, but I think actually there

657
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,280
 is another book coming in the same series also about Muh Salah.

658
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,440
 So I will be reading that one.

659
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,040
 And my pick this time is Sibilant Frickitive by Adam Roberts, which is a

660
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,520
 collection of his book reviews from New Compress.

661
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
 And what do I like about it?

662
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:38,800
 Well, I like that he is awesomely erudite and uses examples from literally

663
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,600
 everywhere to bring to bear in quite a clever, critical way on all of these

664
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,160
 different things that he is reviewing.

665
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,720
 And yet nevertheless, he's reviewing things from a great many different genre

666
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,400
 in a great many different genres and styles and kind of appreciates them for

667
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,000
 what they are.

668
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,440
 So he's quite good at actually getting into things and going, this is good

669
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,640
 despite the fact that this is a piece of popular culture or this is bad

670
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,480
 despite the fact that everyone thinks it's excellent and it's very thought

671
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,800
 provoking and interesting and also extremely funny.

672
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,720
 Roberts is quite a funny writer and this is a good example of it.

673
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:24,760
 He's more funny, I think, when writing criticism and commentary and tweets than

674
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,440
 he is when he is writing novels.

675
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,880
 So I liked it a lot and I would recommend it and it is from New Compress.

676
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,000
 Yes, I think I think I read most of those kind of when they were on his

677
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,160
 blog.

678
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,560
 Yes, it is a collection of articles from a blog, but I did not read them all

679
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,280
 when they were on the blog and they are not on the blog now because he's put

680
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,720
 them in a book.

681
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,360
 That's how it works.

682
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,280
 Exactly.

683
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,160
 Cunning.

684
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,720
 Capitalism.

685
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,480
 Authors eating, John.

686
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,600
 Authors eating.

687
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,560
 I'd unlike some people, I know I'm broadly in favour of authors eating.

688
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,880
 Pay for art.

689
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,080
 Art is good.

690
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:06,040
 I mean, I'm not sure he's making a million dollars off his small press book of

691
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,640
 criticism here.

692
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,720
 More people should buy the book.

693
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,320
 And the book is only technically available on Amazon.

694
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,160
 So I wrote to, because we have a kind of anti-adam Amazon ebook thing going on now,

695
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,840
 I wrote to Ian Waitsa said, it's only on Amazon, he said, "Oh God,

696
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,960
 73 pound 99."

697
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,040
 And that's what we've done.

698
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,800
 So I have an e-pub.

699
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,600
 The psychopath club is also only on Amazon, but I bought it and then

700
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,680
 converted it into a different format using calibre and that meant I could

701
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,920
 read it on my preferred platform.

702
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,960
 And then we're going to do picks for SF Christmas songs listeners.

703
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,520
 I'm not actually, do you have to pick an SF Christmas song?

704
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,640
 I thought it was just Christmas song.

705
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,160
 No, you just had to pick a Christmas song because yours is a Christmas song,

706
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,400
 isn't it?

707
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,240
 It's a song with a great story about it.

708
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,040
 I just read out what was in the bullet points, which says picks for SF Christmas

709
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,400
 song.

710
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,360
 But all Christmas songs are SF know because they presuppose the existence

711
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,480
 of either God or Santa.

712
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,640
 Oh, no, goodness, you have such a very limited range of Christmas songs in your

713
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,960
 life. In the show notes, I will put a link to a playlist of 100 Christmas songs,

714
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,240
 either of which, none of which presupposes the existence of God or Santa.

715
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,560
 Well, that is, they're not as F know, Alison, and they don't count.

716
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,600
 And we could start with Deck the Halls with Bows of Holly, which is a completely

717
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
 pagan song with no mention of Christmas.

718
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,560
 I mean, there's only about three words in Deck the Halls, and they're all

719
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
 fallalala.

720
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,920
 See, this is what John was complaining about.

721
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,000
 And now we don't do you.

722
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,400
 No, it there are lots of words, including Don, we now are gay apparel,

723
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,400
 and I am going to put a link to the T-shirt in the show notes to make up for that.

724
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,040
 So my pick for SF Christmas song, which is an actual science fictional Christmas

725
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,320
 song, no doubt, absolutely right nailed it, is Caron Bater Prime by Jonathan

726
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,440
 Colton, which is a very, very good song.

727
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,640
 And we're going to link to the YouTube because that also includes a very good video.

728
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,400
 So there you go.

729
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,480
 Nice.

730
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,680
 My pick for best Christmas song is I'm going to pick two because I'm some sort of a

731
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,080
 bell and no.

732
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,480
 One of them is California Christmas time, which is from crazy ex girlfriend.

733
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,160
 And I like that a lot mainly because my wife lived in California for like 20 years

734
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,440
 and like I have lots of friends there.

735
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,120
 So it makes me smile every time I hear it because I think about California and all

736
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,920
 of the good times I've had in California.

737
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,760
 And I like that a great deal and it's also very funny.

738
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:35,600
 The second word I like is Oh Santa by Mr B, which has not safe for work lyrics.

739
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,480
 And I can't play it in front of my parents, but which I love regardless.

740
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,080
 And I've been a huge fan of Mr B ever since I saw him play a small coffee shop

741
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,120
 in Southampton.

742
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,800
 And so I very much like his Christmas Ditty.

743
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,160
 Doesn't everyone have a Christmas playlist and then a second Christmas playlist,

744
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,120
 which is a subset of the first Christmas playlist that you can play in front of

745
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,120
 grandma?

746
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:03,280
 No, that's mostly because I don't really have often have family over to visit

747
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,520
 during Christmas because we go somewhere else.

748
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,200
 So I rely on the fact that there's somewhere else will have a family friendly playlist.

749
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,280
 I think my playlist is family friendly.

750
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,080
 It's just it's also full of extremely obscure Christmas carols.

751
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,760
 So therefore it's not really family friendly.

752
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,480
 Yeah, so so my my pick is a fairly obscure Christmas carol.

753
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,480
 It does presuppose the existence of God.

754
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,360
 John's therefore is a s f naught.

755
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,480
 Oh, it is the carol Bethlehem down, which I love because it is a very beautiful

756
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,960
 carol with gorgeous four part harmony.

757
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,400
 You know, it changes the harmonies in the third verse to emphasize kind of what

758
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,680
 will be coming at Easter for the baby Jesus.

759
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,640
 And it's this kind of lovely sad carol, but I actually love it even more because

760
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,840
 of the story behind it, which is it's composer Peter Warlock and the lyricist

761
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,080
 Bruce Blunt.

762
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,480
 They wrote it and submitted the carol to the daily telegraph's annual Christmas

763
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,920
 carol contest back in 1927.

764
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,600
 And they did this because basically they were short of money.

765
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:08,680
 And when they won the carol contest, they took the money and had essentially a big

766
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,720
 piss up on Christmas Eve. So I love that kind of something so beautiful came out

767
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,480
 of essentially wanting to go and have a massive vendor on Christmas Eve.

768
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,600
 Nice.

769
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,360
 I like massive benders.

770
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,760
 There's a form of words, something like a majestic carol or something.

771
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:32,720
 There is like a they called it a really an immortal carol is what Warlock said

772
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
 about it.

773
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,720
 I should say that I got, you know, I've heard this story a few times and it is

774
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,120
 referenced in the online magazine of a church is where we could be to get

775
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,240
 the reference from, but it could be total bollocks.

776
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,440
 But it's a good story.

777
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,000
 That's probably did win the carol contest.

778
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:57,320
 I would like to address one further issue, which is John.

779
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:03,640
 Can you let us know your future plans for the protection of Marx?

780
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,200
 Oh, yes.

781
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,080
 Yes.

782
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,560
 Now this is very good.

783
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,480
 So I have rotated off the Mark Protection Committee for those who don't know the

784
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:20,840
 Mark Protection Committee is a group of people who are on a committee who look

785
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:26,440
 after world-contrade Marx, but it is much more fun to go up to Mark Plummer

786
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,000
 every Easter con and ask whether he is protected because, you know, you've got

787
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,320
 to find your joy where you can.

788
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,560
 And Mark sent me an email or two over the weekend discussing Wussfuss site

789
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,280
 selection business.

790
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,600
 And at the end of his last email, he wrote, "PS, as I am now unprotected,

791
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,760
 I am wearing armour."

792
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,880
 So I am glad to report that Mark Plummer will still be safe and he is taking matters

793
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,000
 into his own hands.

794
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,120
 But this clearly shows a tragic lack of trust in Wussfuss's ability to protect

795
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,680
 Marx in my absence.

796
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,360
 So Wussfuss, how do you answer these accusations?

797
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,120
 That you will no longer adequately protect Mark Plummer.

798
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,720
 We are not going to give you a right of reply, but let us know in a lock.

799
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,720
 And Nicholas White, who I'm sure would have been extremely capable of

800
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,280
 protecting Mark Plummer and other Marx, applied was a candidate in this

801
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,280
 election, but they had nine candidates for six places on the committee and he

802
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,560
 was not one of those elected.

803
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,120
 So Nicholas White will not be protecting Marx in the future.

804
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,200
 But I'm sure the people who have been elected will thoroughly protect

805
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,960
 Mark Plummer and other Marx going forward.

806
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,320
 Well, they'd better Alison, they'd better.

807
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,080
 Or they'll have us to answer to.

808
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:44,360
 And that was the Octa Thought Podcast and it's goodbye from me.

809
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,840
 It's goodbye from me.

810
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,560
 And it's goodbye from me.

811
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,560
 [Squeaking]

812
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,560
 [Squeaking]

813
00:47:52,560 --> 00:48:02,560
 [Music]

814
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,000
 If I, if I thought it was going in the podcast, I would have been polite.

815
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,920
 No, no, I agree.

816
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,120
 We shouldn't have that in there.

817
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,280
 The theme music for this episode was "It's Christmas Time" by Frank Shurter,

818
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,680
 used under a simplified filmusic.io standard license.

819
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,040
 This podcast will end at the beep.

820
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,320
 Beep.
