1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 I got distracted and was looking at that website, putting.cool.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,400
 Putting.cool?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,200
 And so therefore I've missed the start of this section of the podcast

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,000
 and have no idea what you guys are talking about.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I'm sorry.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,400
 Let's just move on.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,920
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 101st episode of Octa Thorpe,

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
 a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 which is coming to you on the 18th of January 2024.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
 I'm John Coxon.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,400
 I'm Alison Scott.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,600
 And I'm Liz Batty.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,400
 We had some letters of comment.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,200
 We start with competition winner Christopher J. Garcia.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
 Oh ho.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,600
 And it pleased me to listen to Hugo Girl the other day

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,400
 where they read out Goodreads review by Chris.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,400
 Laurie was like, I'm going to read this out like John Reed's on Octa Thorpe.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,800
 Christopher J. Garcia and it may be Giggle.

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,200
 So hello, Hugo Girl people. That was great.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,400
 So Chris is our competition winner.

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,600
 He wins a copy of All These Worlds Reviews and Essays by Neil Harrison.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 Chris, I will mail it to you when I'm in LA

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,600
 because it will be cheaper than mailing it from Newcastle.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
 When are you in LA, John?

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
 For galley.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,200
 Oh, we'll get back to that foreshadowing.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,000
 Congratulations on 100 Episues.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
 I do think I prefer it issue codes, but Episues is good.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,200
 He listened to 23 books, which according to Audible is 14,049 minutes,

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,800
 which is quite a lot of minutes reading.

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
 How many hours is that?

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,400
 I'm going to put it to Liz that even though she read 96 books,

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
 which is four times more than Chris,

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,800
 she may have spent less minutes reading.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,000
 What do you reckon Liz?

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,600
 So it says that 14,049 minutes is about 234 hours.

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,600
 Now, I reckon I read about 100 pages an hour.

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,000
 So the question is, did I read 23,000 pages?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 No.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 So no, it was definitely Chris,

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,800
 but I would point out that I cannot multitask while reading,

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
 whereas maybe, well, I know that John, not John,

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,800
 I know that Chris can definitely multitask while reading

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,000
 as he is abitually doing seven things at once before breakfast.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,600
 He can actually listen to an audiobook in his left ear

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,800
 and octothorp in the right ear, which is a pretty magical skill.

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,600
 He also notes the amazing thing about California libraries is that they no longer have fines.

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,200
 Newcastle also doesn't have fines, which makes me much more likely to return things on time,

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,400
 which is weird psychology.

51
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,000
 It used to be when it was, I paid some money and if I was late,

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,600
 I was just like, oh, I paid the money, it's fine.

53
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 And now it's like, no, don't be late because you're being inconsiderate.

54
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
 And I'm like, but I don't want being inconsiderate.

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,400
 I'm a nice boy.

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
 So I return things on type.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
 And it's very curious how that psychology shakes out.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,000
 Can anyone tell me if Cambridge County Library system still has fines

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 because I think I might sit over them a fiver?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,200
 Is that your library fine, Si?

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,000
 I can't find anything on the Cambridge Library's website about fines.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Oh, no, hang on, charges for late renewals.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
 25p a day, Liz.

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,800
 Well, they weren't 25p a day at the time, but I think I dropped some books back

65
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,200
 and then never went back into the library at one point.

66
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
 So sorry, I probably owe them a fiver.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I hope they don't put interest on that.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,600
 Chris also said, "Romanticy dates back a long way.

69
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,000
 He remembers Gale Carriger calling Solus back in 2009 or so."

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Well, 2009 is a long time in internet time, no?

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
 I think that was a long time.

72
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,800
 I was 20, seems ages ago.

73
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,800
 I think the genre has been around a lot longer than that,

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
 even if it didn't necessarily have a name.

75
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 You know, I think there was a lot of that sort of stuff

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
 knocking around when I were a lass.

77
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
 Yeah, let me find the blog post I want to quote.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
 Carry on while I look for it.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 Neil Harrison agrees with Chris Garcia.

80
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
 So Neil says, on the marriage genre,

81
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,800
 "He's looked into the matter and we can't blame

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 "or credit Goodreads for imagining romance.

83
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
 "It's been at circulation for at least five years,

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
 "although Goodreads has popularized it.

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
 "But then he follows up with, but maybe Goodreads

86
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 "should invent new genres."

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 Spotify does this.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
 There's someone whose job is to look at the emergent patterns

89
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 from listening data and give names to different clusters,

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
 which is how you end up with playlists for things like

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 Catstep, Chamber Psych, and Solip Synthum.

92
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,800
 The fact they are based on actual listening behaviors

93
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
 makes them fascinating.

94
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
 Goodreads could do the same sort of things

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
 and who knows what they'd come up with.

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
 You cannot see on the pub,

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
 but I am nodding vigorously to that suggestion

98
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 that Goodreads should be using its data in this way.

99
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
 Step one, it wouldn't work very well

100
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
 because your data set is so much smaller.

101
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
 Like the number of tracks a music listener listens to

102
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
 in a year is orders of magnitude higher than the number of books

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
 most people read in a year.

104
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
 And so I do think this probably works way better

105
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
 for Spotify than it would for Goodreads.

106
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
 And part of the reason I say this is because if you are interested

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
 in doing this kind of analysis, I have a PhD project available

108
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 on using K-means clustering in order to evaluate

109
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 GMM and SS storms and hemispherek symmetries

110
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
 in the Earth's magnetic field.

111
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
 You can go to northumbria.ac.uk

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 or find a PhD.co.uk and search

113
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
 and you will find the project.

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
 So if you're interested in this kind of science,

115
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
 come work with me.

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
 New Castle's great.

117
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
 I'm great.

118
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 Yay!

119
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 But what if I'm more interested in micro genres

120
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,800
 of science fiction and fantasy that I have?

121
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,800
 My recommendation is to do a PhD in clustering machine learning

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
 and then go work for a company that does it.

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
 It turns out many people who do PhDs on ML

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 end up working for companies doing ML rather than in academia

125
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 which is shocking.

126
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
 Yeah, go and do a PhD with John

127
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,800
 and then you can call yourself a data scientist

128
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
 and machine learning specialist and earn quite a lot more money

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
 than you would continuing to work for John.

130
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
 Sorry, John.

131
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
 Anyway, romantic.

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 Because having complained about it,

133
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
 I think there's two things.

134
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,800
 One is that yes, it clearly does exist as a category

135
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,800
 and has existed before Goodreads started picking it up,

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
 although maybe was not often called that.

137
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,800
 And in fact, Adam Roberts had a blog post in mid-December

138
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,800
 which I missed precisely about this and talking about

139
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
 Jacqueline Carey's books as maybe one of the kind of first things

140
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
 you can point at and say they are romantic.

141
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,800
 The other thing is really I see it as Goodreads

142
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
 adding an extra category into their awards for a thing where there are

143
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,800
 maybe lots of books in this area, but it also feels a little bit like

144
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,800
 let's take all these books out of fantasy and give them their own box

145
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
 and I'm not sure how I feel about that.

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
 Good.

147
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
 I think you feel good about it.

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
 Is that helpful?

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 Possibly.

150
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 I mean, Goodreads are reflecting what a chunk of readership is reading

151
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 and looking for in fantasy.

152
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,800
 You see, when I'm kind of looking at a fantasy book to read,

153
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 I'm kind of looking at all the ones that aren't that.

154
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,800
 So it's quite useful for me to have them offered a genre.

155
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,800
 I mean, I guess I do read things that you could call romantic but just not that many.

156
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
 Tell me if you think this is an untarable interpretation,

157
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,800
 but I suspect you would find, my guess would have been that you'd find

158
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 the distinction useful because there are certain books.

159
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 So for instance with Legends of L'Arte's, right?

160
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,800
 Like if that was in romanticity rather than fantasy, you'd be like,

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
 "Oh, brilliant.

162
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,800
 That's in the bit that I can safely ignore or dip into when I want to cosy read."

163
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,800
 And these are the bits where I might actually nominate them for Who Goes.

164
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 But I don't think romanticity is kind of not romantic, though.

165
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,800
 Yeah, I don't think romanticity is cosy.

166
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
 What? What's the point?

167
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 The point is the romance, right?

168
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,800
 It's the strong central romance as the thing, whereas when I read a fancy book

169
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 with a strong central romance, I go, "Oh, God, let me get back to my fantasy world."

170
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
 And what's interesting and different about it?

171
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,800
 Because if I wanted to read a romance book, I'd go and read a romance book.

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 In what way does Legends of L'Arte's not fill the description you just set?

173
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
 Cos it's to me.

174
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
 The central romance is wet and doesn't take up very much for the plot.

175
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
 I mean, in that it has that in common with everything else in the book, but yeah.

176
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
 I prefer the wet romance.

177
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,800
 Well, what you want, Jon is smot talk, which is also a category apparently.

178
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
 Smot talk.

179
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
 Oh.

180
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
 Yeah.

181
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
 Hang on, smot.

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 Smot has in the Tom Lera song.

183
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
 Yes, Jon, obviously.

184
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
 It didn't have any smot.

185
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
 Like, I'll put it this way.

186
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
 I thought it was a lot more romance than I did smot.

187
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 Yes, but romance has a lot more smot in it than you think.

188
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,800
 Yeah, so, romanticy probably has quite a lot of smot in it, I would think.

189
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
 I have not that I've read a lot of it, but on average.

190
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,800
 Listeners, if you are bigger readers of, like, romanticy than I am,

191
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 and I think I've read a handful of books you would pick as romanticy, but not that many,

192
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
 please let us know kind of how you would define it.

193
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
 Fair.

194
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
 Shall we move on?

195
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
 Yeah, I suppose so.

196
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
 I think this is the living rights in saying that this is thoroughly insufficient as a letter

197
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,800
 of comment, especially given how long it's been since they last sent us one.

198
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 Now, there is no minimum quality of lock required.

199
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 If we start getting into minimum qualities of products, some of our previous episodes

200
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
 would be ropey at best.

201
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,800
 So, yes, feel free to write us with any inane thoughts you like.

202
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,800
 But Jerry notes that I forgot to credit one of the scenarios in, if I ran the zucon,

203
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 which is the BNF scenario by Priscilla Olson and Fred Isaacson, there's a joke,

204
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,800
 so I'll put that in the show notes in a minute.

205
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
 When that was a good one?

206
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
 Yes, it was.

207
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 And then also went back to episode 98 and offers a small correction to Mark's lock,

208
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,800
 which is Mark wrote that LA was in 1994.

209
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,800
 And of course it was in 1984.

210
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,800
 So, yes, unless it was time travel.

211
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
 Mark, how was the 1994 LA WorldCom?

212
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 It would actually have been unallowed.

213
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,800
 So, in the parallel universe when there was a 1994 WorldCom, it would have had to have been

214
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
 after a change to the Constitution.

215
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,800
 Or 1993, San Francisco didn't happen for some reason.

216
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
 No, no, that's one of them.

217
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 What's names?

218
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 A fixed point.

219
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
 That's the badger.

220
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 Alright, does that have to exist so that if Spaniel comes along so that you may later

221
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 meet a Spaniel at another WorldCom and get married?

222
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 Yes.

223
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 Oh.

224
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 Very important.

225
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:11,800
 Bridget Bradshaw sends us a letter of comment saying, congratulations and thank you for 100 episodes.

226
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 You are most welcome.

227
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 Thank you for being here with us.

228
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,800
 She says she is sad to hear unsung stories of Step Back from print publishing.

229
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,800
 She messed up her plan not to buy books faster than she reads them when they offered 18 books for 50 quid.

230
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,800
 And she sent us a photograph of a very lovely looking shelf with lots of very lovely looking paperbacks on it,

231
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,800
 including the Corobones by E.J. Swift.

232
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 But she notes that the Corobones is out again in paperback, this time from Joe Fletcher Books.

233
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 And we will put a link to that in the show notes.

234
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
 Thank you for pointing that out, Bridget.

235
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,800
 What you could do is put that bookshelf in as chapter art.

236
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 Yes, I could do that.

237
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 That's a good idea.

238
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 Yeah.

239
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
 For the two people who see the chapter art.

240
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,800
 On the subject of 100th episode, congratulations.

241
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:07,800
 We also heard from Fiona Moore and Johnny Badley and Dave Mansfield congratulating us for 100 episodes.

242
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 Thank you very much, folks.

243
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
 And Trishy M. on Blue Sky also said that.

244
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
 Yes.

245
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
 We're on Blue Sky, by the way.

246
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 You can follow us.

247
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
 I might post on it if I remember.

248
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 Bad at social media.

249
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 Edwin Mooreland also said not only a rare time, all of our picks were books, but also a rare time that he'd already encountered all of the picks.

250
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,800
 We should announce what our next book club pick is going to be so that people can read it before we talk about it if they want to.

251
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:48,800
 We should.

252
00:12:48,800 --> 00:13:01,800
 We also heard from Dave Mansfield, who said, "Dear Octagons, as an influencer on the Podbean socials, we'd love to get a shout out to your audience of Science Fiction and SF fandom.

253
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 The opportunity to hear about FunCon 1."

254
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:12,800
 So this is a very excellent reproduction of emails we get on the regular from people who are like, "Hello, will you please influence on this thing?"

255
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
 And I'm like, "No, go away."

256
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
 But Dave is lovely, so we have not told them to go away.

257
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:25,800
 So FunCon 1 is a weekend convention at the end of May, which is in the Palace Hotel in Buxton, and it is called Space Leopard, probably.

258
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
 Won't eat your face.

259
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,800
 Wear fun, meet science, meet fiction.

260
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:37,800
 This is one of a number of conventions which are coming up in the next year, which we will henceforth talk about.

261
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 And FunCon 1 is in the hotel that NovaCon is in, usually.

262
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,800
 So if you like that hotel, do go along. Or if you like fun.

263
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 I thought you were going to say this is one of a number of conventions which is happening this year in the Buxton Palace Hotel in Buxton.

264
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,800
 It's a big weird if the Buxton Palace wasn't in Buxton when it happened.

265
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,800
 I can open the Buxton Palace in Stafford just to confuse everyone.

266
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:16,800
 So I'm going to mention very quickly that Contable A Triple Time, that's the 34th Film Convention, is happening on the 2nd to 4th of February in the Palace Hotel in Buxton.

267
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
 So if you were a Filker, I don't know if we have any Filkers listening if you're a Filker.

268
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
 Hello?

269
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,800
 And that is also going to be in the Palace Hotel in Buxton.

270
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 And they haven't had an in-person film con for a few years, so this is quite exciting I think.

271
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
 Emily January is a Filker, so we've got at least one.

272
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,800
 And I hope all the Filkers already know about it because it is in like two weeks, so you've probably got a week to sign up for the day of this pod.

273
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,800
 Yeah but somebody out there might go, "Filk, what on earth is Filk? I should look into it."

274
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,800
 And Filk is science fiction and folk music guys, everyone knows that right.

275
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 And if you want to listen to it, I knew you'd like Buxton.

276
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
 Yes, if you like Buxton.

277
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun.

278
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
 Uh, Filk is where you f*ck.

279
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:23,640
 [

280
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:31,640
 There is also probably PicoCon, which will probably be in February.

281
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:39,640
 Probably. PicoCon is organized by undergraduates, and therefore the lead time on the announcement is not always what you might want it to be in an ideal world.

282
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,640
 It's organized by the Imperial College Science Fiction Society, who may or may not be OntoGrads.

283
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:53,640
 There may be grad students, which is probably a tiny step up in organizational capacity and busyness, but yeah.

284
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:00,640
 It would be nice if they would let the world know when they're going to have PicoCon.

285
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
 Something about now.

286
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:09,640
 Do you want me to do my provocative people should stop complaining about this so you guys can vigorously disagree with me?

287
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,640
 It can if you want, unless you're bored of that rant already.

288
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:23,640
 I think that there is a segment of British Science Fiction Convention fandom who would quite like PicoCon to be a lot more organized than it is and have forgotten what it was like to be undergraduates.

289
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:39,640
 So, I think that John may be talking out of his hat here because the thing about PicoCon is that it probably doesn't pay for, but books out the Imperial College Student Union for the whole of the Student Union for an entire Saturday.

290
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:50,640
 And my theory is that this date that they're going to do this on is not actually still under negotiation, but it has in fact been in the diary for some considerable time, possibly since the day after PicoCon last year.

291
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,640
 And they could perfectly well tell us what it's going to be. We're not asking for a lot.

292
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:08,640
 We don't need you to do a whole thing with, you know, where do you have to go and what you do and just tell us the date it's going to be on so that we can turn up at Imperial College at 10 o'clock in the morning, or if you're me about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

293
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:24,640
 And come to a convention. It's normally about the third Saturday in February, but people like us. And I guess Dave Langford, who does the indispensable news fanzine answerable, would like to know before our deadlines.

294
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:32,640
 If PicoCon is going to be before our next episode, please tell us so that we can publicize your convention. That's all we ask.

295
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:51,640
 I suppose the question is, who is PicoCon for? If the thing of PicoCon is to try and get a bunch of people to turn up and pay a small entry fee and, you know, that helps the society have some money to do fun stuff, then you probably want to advertise it in time to have people turn up.

296
00:17:51,640 --> 00:18:02,640
 Whereas if it's just sort of like a day when we're going to spend a day talking about science fiction and being in the bar, then it's probably less essential that you advertise it early enough to get people to come in potentially from out of town.

297
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 I only ran one convention when I was an undergraduate, which was a convention called SabreCon, which we ran at the University of Leicester Students Union, but we did not run it to make money.

298
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,640
 We spent all the money on things for the convention.

299
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:36,640
 Possible they spend all the money, I don't actually know. I think we may all be too out of date to really speak to modern undergrads and what their lives are like now, though, but yeah, it's quite possible that they are all very busy frantically trying to get their money is worth out of their thousands of pounds they've spent on university.

300
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 Yup.

301
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:45,640
 Yeah, and indeed last year PicoCon, which is always in February, was in March, so it's possible that that will happen again.

302
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,640
 [Music]

303
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:59,640
 Hello everyone, John from the future here. We heard after we'd recorded that PicoCon will be happening on the 23rd of March.

304
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,640
 [Music]

305
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:14,640
 There is also going to be an EasterCon, which will be at the end of March, 2024, in a place called Telford, and will probably be good.

306
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
 I'm going.

307
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
 I'm going.

308
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
 Liz isn't going.

309
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,640
 Yeah, so, so not, it's going to be quite a small EasterCon, which I guess we probably knew because...

310
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
 It's a WorldCon year.

311
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
 It's a WorldCon year.

312
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,640
 The small ones are more juicy.

313
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
 [Laughs]

314
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,640
 I quite like Easter, a small EasterCon, because, you know...

315
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,640
 I like all Eastercons, but small Eastercons do definitely have, they are definitely good Eastercons.

316
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
 They have a vibe.

317
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640
 They're all good Eastercons, Brent.

318
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,640
 We could discuss which were the good Eastercons in one of these.

319
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,640
 Have a, have a, have a, what's the name of draft, where we draft Eastercons.

320
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,640
 Oh yeah, can we have another one of these, please?

321
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
 In the order we enjoyed them.

322
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
 [Laughs]

323
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,640
 Last thing about conventions, you can never go back.

324
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,640
 Which convention would you like to go to again?

325
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,640
 Though, I mean, I have a clear top of, clear winner of that, which is LugCon 3.

326
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,640
 I would like to go again as a punter, rather as somebody who wore a high vis jacket for 17 hours.

327
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,640
 I would like to go to LugCon 3.

328
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:23,640
 I am as previously referenced going to a convention called Gallifrey 1, which will be in mid February

329
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,640
 in LA, in the United States.

330
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,640
 So if anyone is planning to be there, hit me, hit me up.

331
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
 Say, say so, and we'll hang out, it'll be good.

332
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,640
 Are you going to have Octa thought ribbons to give people John?

333
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
 Errrr.

334
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,640
 Don't know, probably not, but we'll see.

335
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,640
 We are working on our cosplays, which will be very good.

336
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,640
 They are British, genre, comedy, but they are not Doctor Who.

337
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 Ghosts?

338
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
 No, better.

339
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,640
 Ghosts, oh no, that was a little sad of me there.

340
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
 She was.

341
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
 Hmm.

342
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
 British?

343
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,640
 No, I am going to go as Garth Merengi.

344
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
 Oh yes.

345
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
 [Laughs]

346
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:14,640
 I have brought a bull belt buckle and a pair of gold like glasses like the ones he wears.

347
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,640
 Er, and we've got lab coats and it's just generally going to be great.

348
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,640
 Nobody's going to realise you're cosplaying, are they?

349
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
 That's brilliant.

350
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
 I think they will.

351
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
 I hope they will.

352
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,640
 We haven't yet fully completed it, but we are working on it.

353
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,640
 So I might have to have ribbons that say, "I know writers who use subtext and they're all cowards."

354
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
 Yes.

355
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,640
 Which is one of my favourite Garth Merengi quotes.

356
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640
 Absolutely.

357
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,640
 Can I ask who is España being?

358
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
 She's going to go as Liz Asher.

359
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,640
 She's going to get a blonde wig and she's going to wear the beads.

360
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
 That's the problem.

361
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,640
 I, because she can't go, she can't go as Dean Learner, because I think it would be not obvious enough.

362
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,640
 And she's not really got the frame from that berry.

363
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
 She's definitely got the attitude.

364
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
 Yeah, that's it.

365
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,640
 I mean, I think it would be great if she was Dean Learner.

366
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
 But, yeah, maybe not.

367
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,640
 The one problem with Garth Merengi's Dark Place is that it was made in a time.

368
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,640
 I think if it was made today, it would have a lot more women in it than it did at the time.

369
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,640
 Are we sure España can't pull off Matt Berry?

370
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,640
 Can she do the voice?

371
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,640
 I'm sure she could pull him off.

372
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,640
 And there will also be a world con.

373
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:36,640
 I don't know if people are aware that Glasgow 2024 is occurring with maybe unturable, but we'll be

374
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 banged on about it a bit.

375
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
 But we do have a couple of tidbits of Glasgow news.

376
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,640
 And Liz put one of these in the show notes.

377
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
 Liz.

378
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:55,640
 Yeah, I put one in saying that Glasgow Hotel Bookings opened January 22nd, which I got off the Glasgow Welcome Facebook page.

379
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,640
 Intrepid researcher Liz.

380
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,640
 I'm going to go and check it and enjoy these typing noises.

381
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
 Yes.

382
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
 20 seconds.

383
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,640
 Keep an eye on their socials for further information.

384
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
 Nice.

385
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,640
 If you are staff, you will have already had the link for Hotel Bookings.

386
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:24,640
 Like it goes as Liz says, it goes live on the 22nd, which if you're listening to this on the day of release will be on Monday.

387
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,640
 So look out for it on Monday.

388
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,640
 We have booked in the Campanile or the Campanile, depending on how that word is pronounced.

389
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,640
 Oh yeah, we're in the moxie I think.

390
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
 I was going to go for the village.

391
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:48,640
 John, I will just say I would check the recent reviews for the Campanile Campanile on TripAdvisor because they are a bit of a thumbs down.

392
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,640
 Oh, they were right when I say their last time, but that was a little bit ago.

393
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,640
 Yeah, they were fine when I stayed there in 2005.

394
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,640
 From the reviews on the website, it sounds like they may not have updated the hotels since 2005.

395
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
 So I'd have a quick check.

396
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,640
 I think I'm going to go for the village, probably, which is a little bit pricier, but not much pricier.

397
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
 The village also has a swimming pool.

398
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
 That's really nice swimming pool.

399
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,640
 Village hotels are kind of like swimming pools with hotels attached to them.

400
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,640
 It does, but how, I mean, I thought about that, but then I also thought how much am I going to go swimming during your World Cup?

401
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,640
 Yeah, that was why we ended up on the right side of the river.

402
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,640
 Yes, in case anyone has not been on Worldcon staff, generally what happens is they let the staff book a little early,

403
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,640
 so they can break the booking website in all kinds of different ways before we let the general public loose on it.

404
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,640
 But that does mean you get to book a little bit early.

405
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
 Yes, which makes sense.

406
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,640
 Yeah, it totally makes sense, but it is also a nice tiny perk if you think your preferred hotel is going to sell out.

407
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,640
 I'm not sure they will, but all the hotels are quite big.

408
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
 Yeah, now in Indeed.

409
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,640
 And then there's also a other thing.

410
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,640
 But do you like to be more specific?

411
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
 Or would you like one of us to people?

412
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,640
 I would love to be more specific.

413
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,640
 There is also some news that they have some new special guests.

414
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:16,640
 So they have the hosts of three black halflings, which is a TTRPG podcast.

415
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,640
 They are going to be doing live shows in Manchester and London in April in 2024,

416
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 and they're coming to Glasgow as well.

417
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,640
 Presumably they will do a live show at Glasgow, but that is not stipulated.

418
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,640
 We will put a link in the show notes to the final 770 story.

419
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,640
 But yes, this is really interesting because they also announced Tanya DuPasse previously.

420
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:45,640
 And so I am excited by the number of gaming related editions from recent times.

421
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,640
 You might also think that the chair of Glasgow 2024 was a professor of games.

422
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,640
 I would also say if you said what is like an area of major, major interests

423
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,640
 that Worldgons have typically not covered very well, it is gaming.

424
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,640
 So it definitely makes sense to beep things up there, beep things up there, not beep things up.

425
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,640
 John will beep things up later.

426
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,640
 Beep things up by getting some special guests in that area.

427
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
 We have altered our booking.

428
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
 And where have you gone to?

429
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
 The village.

430
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,640
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

431
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
 Oh John, we can have breakfast together.

432
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,640
 Did you look at the reviews for the company?

433
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,640
 It's probably company because of French I think.

434
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,640
 I was going to go to the village and I had said that, but then when I thought about a choice

435
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,640
 between over the river and not over the river, I went for not over the river.

436
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
 I'm not.

437
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,640
 Yeah, I don't know if I think I don't really care.

438
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
 Is that bad?

439
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,640
 Depends if you like to pop back and forth your hotel room the extra five minutes, you know,

440
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,640
 becomes quite an obstacle if you want to pop back five or six times a day and leave things

441
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,640
 there or nap or whatever.

442
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,640
 But I think if you're going to leave your room in the morning and then go back at two in the

443
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
 morning, it's not a big deal.

444
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
 I'm not sure it's closer.

445
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
 What's that?

446
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
 I'm not sure it's actually any closer.

447
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
 It's closer to the bits of the SEC we're not using.

448
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,640
 I think the village may be, they're very close.

449
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
 Oh is there a bridge somewhere?

450
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
 I'm going to look at it.

451
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,640
 There's a bridge that goes basically like right by the village.

452
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,640
 You have to walk past the premiere in.

453
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,640
 So Alison just doesn't like crossing running water?

454
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
 She is a vampire.

455
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
 We do know this about her.

456
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,640
 I am vaguely, vaguely worried that something might go wrong with the footbridge and leave

457
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,640
 you with a long walk at the middle of the night.

458
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
 I see.

459
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,640
 You've got to bear in mind that Alison lives in North London and so places south of any

460
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,640
 river innately scare her in ways that as non-landiners we can't even begin to grasp.

461
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,640
 That is 100% true.

462
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:54,640
 How do you feel about Gates said John?

463
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,000
 We're going to be talking about things we might nominate for the Hugos over the next few

464
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,640
 episodes and we would like your help.

465
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,640
 Please email us your favourite things from 2023.

466
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
 Please do not email us your favourite things from other years.

467
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:18,640
 We're interested in 2023 specifically but please do let us know and then we can read them and

468
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,640
 maybe shout them out on the pod if we think they're good or watch them or listen to them

469
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
 or other things.

470
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,640
 And in forthcoming book news, China Mayville and Keanu Reeves are doing a collab.

471
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,640
 It's a Keanu Reeves created universe that started as a comic and he invited China Mayville

472
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:46,640
 to write a book in that universe.

473
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,640
 And say what you want about Keanu Reeves, he has very good taste.

474
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,640
 Like I've never seen a thing that Keanu Reeves was in where I've been like oh I don't understand

475
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
 why he did this project.

476
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,640
 He is, yeah, no, his presence in things is usually a good sign.

477
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,640
 His acting in them, not always a good thing but his presence indicates that it had merit

478
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
 on the surface.

479
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
 Is that too harsh?

480
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,640
 Um, no, maybe it may not be harsh enough John.

481
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
 Well like, because every time I see him in a movie, very often I think he does not bring

482
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,640
 much to the text but very often I think the text has something really interesting about

483
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
 it and I can see why he agreed to do it.

484
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,640
 It's like the opposite of someone who does terrible things and elevates them if that makes sense.

485
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
 [laughter]

486
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,640
 I think he's very good in films where, like there are obviously films where he's really

487
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,640
 well suited to them and they work really well.

488
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,640
 And then sometimes he's in a film where I'm like this film was not super well suited to

489
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
 you, what are you doing?

490
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,640
 Which I would pick, 2005's, Constantine.

491
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:58,640
 I think if you didn't know much about Hellblazer Constantine was quite good because relevant

492
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,640
 to the rest of genre movies in 2005, I think it was quite imaginative.

493
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,640
 It's just relevant to Hellblazer, it was not relevant, relative.

494
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
 Does that make sense?

495
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
 Yeah.

496
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
 This is just staring at me.

497
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,640
 Yeah, I mean I think we may be going on about Keanu Reeves a little bit too much now.

498
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,640
 I suppose it's fair, I am okay, there's too much Keanu Reeves but yes, it's true, I was

499
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,640
 thinking of Hellblazer as he kind of has written in the comics which is very much not like

500
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
 Keanu Reeves.

501
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
 Oh yes, that is true, that is 100% true.

502
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,640
 But he is great and always be my maybe, so.

503
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,640
 He is so good in that movie.

504
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
 Yes, it's so funny.

505
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
 I have not seen that movie, should I see that movie?

506
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,640
 Yeah, John has plugged it before on the podcast.

507
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,640
 Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

508
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
 Bye, yeah.

509
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,640
 When I get Netflix back it's one of the things I might rewatch.

510
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
 I'm not on Netflix because I've got Netflix back.

511
00:30:51,640 --> 00:31:01,640
 Yes, yeah, it's like a Netflix original film.

512
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,640
 So I'm slightly pre-empting the conversation about things we might nominate in best dramatic

513
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
 presentation long form with this pick.

514
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,640
 But I am going to pick poor things, the new Jorgos Lanteos directed film starring Emma

515
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,640
 Stone, which I went to see yesterday.

516
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,640
 It was released in the US in 2023, so it is eligible for nomination in 2034.

517
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,640
 It's Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo and William Defoe, sorry, William Defoe.

518
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
 And it's just great.

519
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,640
 It's not a movie to watch with family.

520
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,640
 You should definitely not watch it with your children or your parents.

521
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:45,640
 And it really, the 18 rating at the start says that it contains strong sex and I made fun of

522
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
 it.

523
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
 What does that mean?

524
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:53,640
 And then it became very obvious through the film exactly what that meant and it was.

525
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,640
 Gosh.

526
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
 But it's very, very interesting.

527
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,640
 It's very, very disturbing in the way that Lanthamoss' films tend to be.

528
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,640
 I liked it more than I liked the favourite, I think.

529
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,640
 I definitely liked it more than the lobster.

530
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
 It was very good.

531
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,640
 And Emma Stone is absolutely fantastic in it and thoroughly deserved the Golden Globe.

532
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,640
 Ruffalo also doing his best Matt Berry impersonation, which is something I never thought I'd see,

533
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
 but I am very glad I have seen it.

534
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
 Basically, he plays Toast of London.

535
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,640
 Like if they ever need to do a Toast of London, whether a tour of them, I feel like Mark Ruffalo

536
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
 would be great casting.

537
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,640
 Have I had to review seen this or read the book it's based on?

538
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,640
 I read the book poor things a very long time ago and yeah, no, I'm going to look out for

539
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
 this.

540
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
 I should go and see this.

541
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
 Yeah.

542
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,640
 I haven't read it and I don't think it's out here yet, but it's hard to find kind of upcoming

543
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
 film release dates.

544
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,640
 So I'm just hoping it might come out in February or something.

545
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,640
 We went to Finsbury Park over the Christmas break for a thing and discovered that Finsbury

546
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,640
 Park has a picture house, which is probably our closest decent cinema that's accessible

547
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
 by public transport now.

548
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
 So that was quite exciting.

549
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
 I can actually go to the movies again.

550
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,640
 I will also say I didn't understand all the controversy about Scotland.

551
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
 It seems fine that it's set in London.

552
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,640
 He's kind of like a national hero, right?

553
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,640
 I saw a bit of trivia on IMDB.

554
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,640
 So, Yourgos Lanthamos approached Alistair Gray about adapting poor things.

555
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,640
 Apparently in 2009, and Gray took Lanthamos on a personal tour of Glasgow.

556
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,640
 Can you imagine if we could have done that as a Glasgow 2024 programme?

557
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,640
 I am just following Yourgos Lanthamos on a tour being given by Alistair Gray would have been

558
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
 great.

559
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
 Lanthamos said he was a very lovely man.

560
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,640
 Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we made the film, but he was very special

561
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
 and energetic.

562
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,640
 He was 80 something when we met, and as soon as I got there, he had seen his previous film,

563
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,640
 Dogtooth, and said, "I had my friend put on the DVD because I don't know how to operate

564
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,640
 these things, but I think you're a very talented young man."

565
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
 Which is freaking excellent.

566
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
 I like that.

567
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
 That is good.

568
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,640
 That is good.

569
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
 He came to a Mexican.

570
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
 Oh, did he?

571
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
 Nice.

572
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

573
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,640
 Um, Mexico 3, Mexico 4, one of them.

574
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,640
 Um, somebody will write in.

575
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
 He was good.

576
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,640
 I mean, Mexico doesn't have guests, but obviously he was guests, and yeah, no, it was great.

577
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
 No, highly recommended.

578
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,640
 Um, presumably we'll be coming to Disney Plus because it is, I believe, a Disney film.

579
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
 Ooh.

580
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,640
 Ah, okay.

581
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
 Well, Dodd.

582
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
 That's the most likely place I will see it then.

583
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,640
 Yeah, it's not a film that shies away from uncomfortable subject matter.

584
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
 I will say that.

585
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:35,640
 Um, probably, probably content warnings for underage sex and problematic power dynamics.

586
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
 I, yeah.

587
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:42,640
 Um, so if those are like things that are likely to bother you, I might think about whether

588
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,640
 or not you should see it.

589
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,640
 Um, but I think, I think it's deconstructing the power dynamics between men and women in

590
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,640
 relationships in a way that's really interesting.

591
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,640
 Um, but it does so by portraying some of them.

592
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,640
 Yeah, I wonder if it's still going to be on next week when we don't have plague.

593
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,640
 Ah, possibly.

594
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,640
 Hi everyone, it's John from the Future again here.

595
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,640
 There is an exhibition of costumes from poor things being shown at the Barbican until the

596
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:30,640
 26th of January, which I meant to mention during the recording, and I forgot.

597
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,640
 Right, so I've gone back to the safe territory of movies for my picks.

598
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
 Everything is right with the world.

599
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,640
 And now I confidently predict that one of my co-hosts will pick a game.

600
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
 Yeah, yeah.

601
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
 Um, it's not me.

602
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
 Wild.

603
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,640
 This is because I wrote "It's a game in the show notes."

604
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,640
 So it's not like John has developed precognitive abilities or anything.

605
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,640
 I am picking a game which was recommended to me by Abigail Nussbaum.

606
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,640
 I think she's just quite good at finding like little indie games it turns out I might like.

607
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,640
 Oh, it's a video game.

608
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,640
 Every time this has happened, I've then lost a significant portion of the following week

609
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
 to completing the game that has been mentioned.

610
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
 It's quite a short game.

611
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,640
 So it's a video game called "Cance of Sinar", which Abigail compared to another game called

612
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,640
 Heaven's Vault, which I haven't played, which I might then go and play.

613
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,640
 Anyway, "Cance of Sinar", you're basically kind of thrust into a world which it turns

614
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
 out is a tower.

615
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,640
 And on each level of the tower is a different people's and you have to basically figure out

616
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
 their language.

617
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,640
 Usually by listening to them, reading written materials, listening to what they say, and

618
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,640
 you're sort of figuring out, okay, well, the first example is you go to a place with like

619
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,640
 a couple of levers and you push one and a gate moves up and the other one, you push it

620
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,640
 and the gate moves down and see like, okay, well, this is the words up and down then.

621
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,640
 And then you go through to the next area and someone says, you know, mystery character

622
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,640
 up and then mystery character down.

623
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,640
 And you figure out these must mean me and you based on who's supposed to be doing different

624
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
 things.

625
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
 And it just does that for the whole game.

626
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,640
 You're trying to figure out from context what the unknown words mean.

627
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
 And it's quite clever.

628
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,640
 So at some point it will offer you the chance to kind of demonstrate that you understand

629
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,640
 some words and then it will lock you in and give you the official translation.

630
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,440
 And until then you can put in your own like unofficial little notes and translations and

631
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,640
 things and it will translate what people are saying.

632
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
 And the languages are clever.

633
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,720
 Like, you know, you'll figure out that some of the characters and maybe two other characters

634
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,640
 put together to form a particular word in a way that makes sense.

635
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,960
 And it all starts to come together, what's going on in this tower and what has happened

636
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,480
 as you learn the languages of the different people going up.

637
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
 So it's really neat.

638
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,800
 And mostly puzzles, it does have a few sort of like stealth bits which are not very difficult

639
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,680
 but a little bit annoying.

640
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,600
 And I will say I played it on my nice new Nintendo Switch which is probably not the

641
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,160
 best platform because the, at least you've put on the handheld one, the screen is a little

642
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,440
 bit small.

643
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,040
 And there was one stealth bit I was having difficulty completing and I watched like a

644
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,160
 little video walk through of someone doing it.

645
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,680
 And I was like, ah, you can like select a particular thing that I don't seem to be able

646
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,720
 to select with the controls on the Switch.

647
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,600
 You have to click point and click on a mouse to do it.

648
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,800
 So I think like it's a little bit more difficult on the Switch just because you can't see some

649
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,240
 of the stuff on the small screen but otherwise it seems perfectly playable.

650
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,200
 And so I happily sat there playing through this.

651
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,080
 I would say it takes maybe 12 or 15 hours.

652
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,960
 So it's not super long but it is quite moreish when you're like, oh, I've only got to figure

653
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,440
 out another four characters and then I'll have this whole language.

654
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,200
 And then you move the next floor and there's another whole language and you're like, I'll

655
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,400
 just play a little bit more, a little bit more and it's quite moreish.

656
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,720
 So sorry, Alison, for telling you about it.

657
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,760
 Oh, I love that sort of thing.

658
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,240
 I'll bear it in mind if I come down with plague in the next day or two, which is not

659
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
 unlikely.

660
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:05,800
 Do you mind if I post a spoiler on Discord because this is 20% off on Switch until today

661
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,000
 and it is 20% off until Wednesday on PlayStation and Xbox in the UK?

662
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,080
 Yeah, no, can you put that down?

663
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,560
 Because I might go and buy it as soon as we finish the pod.

664
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,800
 It's like 12 quid or something on Switch.

665
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,560
 So it's probably cheaper on PlayStation.

666
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,360
 I should have gone on PlayStation.

667
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
 Same price.

668
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,840
 Yeah, but probably not in Thailand where PlayStation prices in Thailand tend to be significant

669
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,760
 be below the UK and US ones and Switch prices are not because I have to use the UK store

670
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,320
 and Switch because there's no Thai eShop.

671
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,560
 Ah, right, possibly.

672
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,360
 Which probably explains why the Switch is not very popular.

673
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,400
 You know, I can imagine that.

674
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,800
 Listeners, I will put links to the UK stores in the show notes because I'm pro-keal.

675
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
 Right, I think so.

676
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
 You'll pick Alison.

677
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
 Can I do my pick now?

678
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,600
 I'm slightly sorry because I may have poached this pick off Liz who did recommend this to

679
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
 me.

680
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,400
 But in my defence, when I went into the show notes to write my pick down, her pick was

681
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
 already there.

682
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,800
 So it's clearly all's fair in love and picking things for OctoThorp.

683
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,320
 So my pick is a graphic novel.

684
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,320
 It is Why Don't You Love Me by Paul B. Rainey.

685
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,880
 And I think I saw some conflicting evidence.

686
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,640
 Suff, somebody said it would be published on his website and then collected into a book

687
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,680
 and somebody said, "Oh no, it's always been a book and that's all it's been."

688
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,240
 So I am not sure which of those is correct.

689
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:38,600
 Each page of the novel, the comic is like one page panel comic of the sort that if you

690
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,920
 ever saw Posey Simmons in the Guardian or numerous other Guardian comics or Sunday

691
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,760
 strips, that sort of format.

692
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,680
 But it has more in common with the Guardian strips than it does with the Sunday ones because

693
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,160
 although there is some humour in quite a lot of these strips, they're not kind of roll

694
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,320
 on the floor laughing funny at any point.

695
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,600
 And indeed the graphic novel is not roll on the floor laughing.

696
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,360
 You are introduced to a couple.

697
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:12,320
 A couple with two children and they are clearly very unhappy and they are having massive fights.

698
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:20,800
 And as long as as well as having massive fights with each other, they are also neglecting

699
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,120
 their children very substantially for, and you just don't know why at the start.

700
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,720
 So you're very much thrown in in media res and obviously gravidually over the course of

701
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,120
 the graphic novel you find out why they are unhappy, why they are not looking after the

702
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,640
 children, what is going on.

703
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,360
 And it does kind of pick up a bit so it is not quite as relentlessly bleak and depressing

704
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,640
 as it seems at the beginning.

705
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:51,000
 But this is not exactly a cheerful graphic novel so you might want to go and read it when

706
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,120
 you're in a imperturbably good mood rather than when you're already a bit grumpy.

707
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,360
 It seemed uncomfortably like my own experience of raising children which was kind of a bit

708
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
 distressing.

709
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,560
 I used to have a fridge magnet that said who are these people and why are they calling

710
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,920
 me bum.

711
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
 And so it was quite resonant in that sense.

712
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
 I thought it was fantastic.

713
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,360
 It's going to be on my Hugo ballot and I appreciate it.

714
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,800
 I've not yet told you enough to understand why it will be on my ballot.

715
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,440
 And I don't really want to because saying why it might be on a Hugo ballot is in itself

716
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,520
 a little bit of a spoiler or even the fact that it could be.

717
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
 But it's good.

718
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
 Go read it.

719
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
 Thought it was great.

720
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,080
 Would like to see more graphic novels like this getting attention.

721
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,680
 It's a graphic novel.

722
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,040
 It is a graphic novel.

723
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,040
 Oh yes.

724
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,400
 So I have a question then which is did you read it in paper or in e?

725
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,080
 I bought it from the library.

726
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,040
 My library had a copy?

727
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
 I...

728
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,360
 In paper or in e?

729
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,360
 From the library.

730
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,160
 My library had an e-book of it and I read it on my iPad.

731
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,400
 Was it good in e-book?

732
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,080
 It was slightly irritating because in fact, I mean I may have been able to sort this out

733
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,640
 but in fact it was presented in two-page spreads.

734
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,840
 So I had to zoom in and then read one page and then swipe my finger over and read the

735
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,840
 other page.

736
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,760
 This is not very irritating in the grand scheme of things but it was just I would have preferred

737
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,640
 it to be one page at a time and that may be something that I could have sorted out in

738
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,640
 the Libby software but did not bother to do so.

739
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
 Read us right in.

740
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,320
 No, I'm very suspicious of...

741
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:34,840
 I love reading comics in electronic format but I'm very suspicious of reading them.

742
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,920
 I used to love comicsology but that's gone now in its Kindle and ebook versions of comics

743
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,560
 are awful and so I'm like I don't want to buy it if it might be awful and the lack of

744
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,680
 delineation between comicsology and Kindle now makes that very difficult and so I'm like

745
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,440
 well I might just buy it in paper.

746
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,880
 Or you might be able to get it from your library thereby cutting through this.

747
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
 Possibly.

748
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,160
 I mean I read it in paper and I borrowed the paper copy so I'm not really much easier.

749
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,120
 That's right can you lend it to me?

750
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,120
 No because I borrowed it from Naughty.

751
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,800
 You can ask him for his copy.

752
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,960
 Naughty if you're listening can I borrow that comment from you?

753
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,120
 But I would say that it is presented in sort of landscape format.

754
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:22,360
 They're kind of rectangular pages that seem like they would be perfectly oriented to be

755
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,760
 read on an iPad or similar.

756
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,680
 I just don't know how big an iPad you need for it to be sensibly workable.

757
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
 It's fine.

758
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,320
 It doesn't have a lot of tiny text or anything.

759
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,120
 It's fine at my 11 inch.

760
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,840
 I prefer reading comics in landscape on iPad.

761
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:44,560
 It's my one criticism of the Marvel Unlimited app is that if a page isn't designed to be

762
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,440
 read as a two page spread you can't read it as one which annoys me because of reading

763
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,240
 comics that I've acquired like in other formats and I can read them in a different app than

764
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,640
 I will read them in landscape preferentially.

765
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,280
 So maybe the pub would be fine.

766
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,560
 I've decided for 2024 I'm going to try and consume all of your pics because I'm a good

767
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
 person.

768
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,120
 Can you get the sample guys?

769
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,920
 Can you get the sample?

770
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,800
 On Kindle just get the sample.

771
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,360
 If it works the sample will work and then you'll know it works or not before you buy the book

772
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,320
 because one great thing about Kindle is that they give you a few pages to read and you

773
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,960
 can find out whether the formatting is terrible.

774
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,720
 Very important for cookbooks this.

775
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,800
 But I do need a Kindle to do that.

776
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,920
 You need to get the Kindle app if you're going to do that yeah.

777
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,640
 Or the Kindle Cloud Reader.

778
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,360
 But actually this one might not be readable in the Kindle Cloud Reader now that I think

779
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,360
 about it.

780
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,680
 So can we have an after show which is Amazon and comics?

781
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,160
 Because I used to know how it works and then Amazon did a lot of things and I don't think

782
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,320
 I know how it works.

783
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,640
 But either of you know how it works.

784
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,880
 Because it says on the Amazon page that I can read it on Comixology.

785
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,520
 Is that actually true?

786
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,040
 Is it just that they've gotten rid of the Comixology store but the apps still exist?

787
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,920
 I thought the app had gone away.

788
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:06,560
 I remember getting an email saying you must move all your stuff into Amazon from Comixology

789
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,480
 which in theory I did.

790
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,200
 But I've got that there are a lot of comics in there that I don't remember buying.

791
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,720
 So I am reading it.

792
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,040
 I am current.

793
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,440
 There is an app on.

794
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,840
 I am reading something on Comixology right now.

795
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,840
 Oh no.

796
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
 Yeah.

797
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:29,240
 I've just opened Comixology and it says as of April 2023 this app is no longer available.

798
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:34,760
 So the Amazon the Amazon website I guess hasn't modified that little string for the last eight

799
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:41,120
 months which my impression is that Amazon has not been taking their comic arm as seriously

800
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:48,760
 as comic fans might like and certainly maybe that's unfair but it seems to be the case.

801
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:55,000
 So I think everything I own on Comixology is now just coming up in my Kindle library.

802
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 Okay.

803
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,400
 And also some comics I don't remember buying.

804
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,360
 Right. Why do I own a bunch of issues of a 2011 on Canny X-Men?

805
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,920
 Can anyone tell me?

806
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,640
 I don't think I bought them.

807
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,640
 Yeah no.

808
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:16,000
 The comic that turned up when I opened Comixology wasn't what I remember buying.

809
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,280
 If you open Comixology do you have a bunch of on Canny X-Men from 2011?

810
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,280
 I do not think I do.

811
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,280
 Alright.

812
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
 I have a lot of Hellblazer.

813
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,080
 I have a lot of Sam Mann.

814
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,480
 I have The Psycho Path Club by Sandra Bond.

815
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,840
 But I don't have any X-Men.

816
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:39,520
 I mean this is a part of what I also say that my pick is also a 2023 game and therefore

817
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,320
 potentially eligible for a Hugo.

818
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,760
 So we're getting your Hugo stuff done early.

819
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,400
 Yes I'm going to try and make sure all my picks are 2023 for the next few weeks.

820
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,560
 Yeah I mean it's not going to win but it's good to have alternatives to Tears of the

821
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,920
 Kingdom so that there are other games alongside it when it inevitably wins.

822
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,680
 I feel like Tears of the Kingdom probably will win and it very much annoys me but there

823
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,680
 we go.

824
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
 Not that I've played it.

825
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,680
 Ha!

826
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,480
 No because I hated Breath of the Worlds sufficiently.

827
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,960
 It's not that I hated it's that it has no forward momentum for me.

828
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,200
 We have a letter of comment on this episode from Andrew January because I posted a link

829
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,880
 to Liz's pick in Discord.

830
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,800
 Andrew January writes in to say on Switch and he assumes other platforms too.

831
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,640
 If you play the demo and then buy the game your progress will carry over which is useful

832
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,640
 to know.

833
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,640
 Thank you very much Andrew.

834
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,080
 And then he says he assumes on the episode that Alison talks about the Sudoku Boys and

835
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,040
 their playthrough.

836
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,920
 So you didn't talk about it.

837
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,920
 Yes.

838
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,720
 Oh so the Sudoku Boys have played through this one as well.

839
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,880
 I mean I kind of do like all the games they play through.

840
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,800
 They do pick them.

841
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,280
 But that also means I can link to that in the show notes for people who do not want to

842
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,080
 play it but do want to get an idea for what it be like.

843
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,960
 So yeah we'll do that.

844
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,560
 Thank you very much for writing in Andrew.

845
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,880
 And that was the Octa Thought Podcast and it's goodbye from me.

846
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,440
 It's goodbye from me.

847
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,880
 And it's goodbye from me.

848
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:39,960
 I almost exclusively play my Switch on the TV because I don't like playing it portably

849
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,840
 because I either use the Joy-Cons which I find are too small for my massive old man

850
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:51,480
 hands or I have to use a like pro controller which I have to take with me as well as the

851
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,480
 Switch.

852
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,560
 And then if I'm going to take the Switch and the controller for the Switch I might as well

853
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,760
 take my iPad which I've got anyway and a controller for the iPad and then play things

854
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
 on the iPad.

855
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,640
 So like almost all the time I'm playing my Switch it's docked which I know is like

856
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,160
 highly atypical but I really wish the controllers were more comfortable.

857
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,760
 I designed for kids I completely understand why but.

858
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:18,120
 Well I have a kind of regular human sized hands and I find them okay.

859
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,960
 It's not the most comfortable one.

860
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:27,600
 Well I have fairly small hands it was what really stopped me taking piano seriously and

861
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,200
 yeah no I really like Joy-Cons they work really well for me.

862
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:38,480
 Oh that's true I can easily do an octave and a second so make a little person hands.

863
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:45,440
 I get RSI if I play the Switch with the in portable mode or if I play it with the Joy-Cons

864
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,280
 slotted into the holder thing.

865
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,280
 The thing yeah.

866
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:53,200
 So I had to buy a pro controller so I could play without getting thumbain.

867
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,520
 Because the Joy-Sticks are too close.

868
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,400
 Which like you know most controllers designed for men so like I'm not begrudging the fact

869
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,400
 that they did one that wasn't.

870
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,160
 And it must be pain in the arse if this is the other way round so I sympathize for all

871
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,640
 you ladies out there.

872
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,320
 It's a penny arcade joke about Xbox controllers isn't it?

873
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,240
 Have you seen that?

874
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,240
 No.

875
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,040
 It's very old now.

876
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,480
 Yeah there are a lot of controllers I just can't use but I'm fine with the PlayStation

877
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,120
 one and I'm fine with the Switch one I'll probably prefer the PlayStation slightly smaller.

878
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:31,520
 Oh dear god I just went up to I just went to look up the penny arcade comic I was referencing

879
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,600
 and it's from 2002.

880
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,000
 Oh my god.

881
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:49,240
 Are you cracking up the finger at 21 year old penny arcade comic?

882
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,560
 21 year old penny arcade.

883
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,600
 I would have sworn I had read all the 21 year old penny arcade comics but apparently not

884
00:51:54,600 --> 00:52:10,640
 or maybe I just forgot it and could read it again.

885
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:20,640
