00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I definitely don't want to go off topic, but congratulations to Australia for kicking the

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 Tories out. Well done.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,800
 Yes, now this is good.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,400
 You absolutely just did go off topic.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,800
 You can't say I don't want to go off topic and then go off topic. Just do it.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,720
 Hello everyone and welcome to Octa Thorpe, the podcast for Science Fiction and Science

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,120
 Fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 26th of May 2022. I'm John Coxon.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:50,160
 And we have some letters of comments. Firstly, we got an email from Phil Dyson, the chair of

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,280
 Eastcon, the previous Eastcon Reclamation 2022 and he writes with his official chair of Eastcon hat,

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,720
 he tells us, "Stricky Bacon is the worth of Satan. Proper Bacon consists of unsmoked

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,960
 backrashes grilled not fried, said rashes must come from a good butcher all other attempts

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,680
 of bacon are unworthy of the name. That is all."

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,080
 He doesn't like American bacon though, obviously.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,000
 He does not specify whether or not he likes American bacon and therefore we cannot.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
 Well, he clearly doesn't like American bacon because what he's talked about is backbacon

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
 and all other bacon being an abomination and that includes American bacon, which does not

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,760
 include any backbacon at all because it's all you cannot sell something as bacon in the United

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,840
 States unless it comes from the pork belly.

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,440
 Ah, in that case maybe.

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,440
 So, only streaky bacon.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,600
 Well, I mean, Phil sent us a follow up email which says, "Alice in is wrong."

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:48,400
 Yeah, I'm feeling very picked upon. I feel like we've got

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,360
 Liz doesn't want any podcasts, not since Alison is very be wrong.

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,960
 And John is sitting there with waffles.

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,640
 No, waffles was yesterday. It's pancakes today.

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,800
 Okay. John is sitting there with pancakes.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,000
 John always has pancakes.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,320
 Yes.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,440
 And I suspect you just need to set up a better pancake delivery service.

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,040
 Because John has one. It's called a spania.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,200
 But do they have bacon with them?

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
 No, because pancakes should be sweet, not savory.

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
 Octa thought the podcast of arguing about food a whole lot.

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,720
 Yes, that is true.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,920
 Yeah, pretty much.

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,080
 Chris Garcia has officially given Liz permission to say yawl.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
 Thank you, Chris.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,920
 As a Texican.

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,520
 Do you think she needs that?

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,280
 I did say I wasn't sure about saying yawl.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
 The modus sounds weird when I say it.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,720
 But I have got official permission now, so we're good.

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,600
 Chris says that Alison is right about bacon.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,320
 Yeah, but he says that John is also correct that American bacon is better than all bacon,

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,440
 which is clearly wrong.

47
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,600
 So, you know, I'm right about bacon.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,320
 John is right about bacon, but Chris is wrong about bacon.

49
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,960
 So, you know, he says he will support our Patreon where we talk,

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,280
 where we talk nonsense about American food.

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
 So that's quite useful. That's one person.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
 He says he's going to see us at Chai-Kon and he's got his hotel and his flight,

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,120
 but he doesn't have his membership.

54
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,080
 And he talks about the amount of gigantic spiders in the hotel.

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,200
 So that is interesting.

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,880
 I don't remember gigantic spiders in Chai-Kon 7,

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,920
 but maybe I was just like having too much fun partying.

58
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,720
 I don't know.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,080
 We face as the gigantic spiders are outside the hotel.

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
 So maybe they're just for some reason gathering outside Chris's room.

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
 Chris, what were you doing?

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,320
 Also, Chris, will you take us for gluten-free pancakes?

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,360
 Yeah, he writes in to say he's got his locations out for where he's going to be having

64
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,440
 this gluten-free pancake breakfast near the hotel, but then unaccountably fails to tell us

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
 the name of the restaurant.

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
 So Chris, write in and let us know.

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,920
 We will keep it under our hats if you're worried about it being full of fans.

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,200
 And also he fails to tell us at what time he's booked the table for the five of us to go and

69
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,080
 have breakfast.

70
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,960
 Sorry, seven of us.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,480
 Seven of us to go and have breakfast.

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,560
 So Chris, get a reservation in please.

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,080
 Let us know.

74
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,800
 Usual channels.

75
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,160
 Good man.

76
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,280
 Mark Plummer wrote to us and he said how much he loves getting distracted and talking about

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,200
 video games, but only almost as much as he loves hearing you, especially John,

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,400
 talk for 15 minutes about Arkham Horror.

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,000
 And now he listens to Octa Thorpe on headphones whilst in his office and says,

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,680
 Octa Thorpe, the perfect accompaniment to tedium.

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
 Yes, and I feel very strongly that this is right.

82
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
 This is what podcasts are for.

83
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
 It's when you're at work and you've got your headphones on and you're like,

84
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
 ugh, you know the podcast and then make it better.

85
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,920
 So hoorah for Mark.

86
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,560
 On the subject of video games, I've been playing Horizon for Bidden West and it's quite good.

87
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
 I'm now a bit shortly after where I went down a hill.

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,440
 Are you going back up a hill again?

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
 No, do you have to go back up a hill?

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,920
 Whoa.

91
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,040
 I don't know.

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
 I've played this game.

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,880
 I have played the little chess substitute thingy which I quite liked and I beat a nice woman who

94
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,360
 taught me the rules and that was good.

95
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,120
 And there's a man and I don't like him.

96
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
 But there's another man who's all right, so hoorah, bounce out.

97
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,560
 I played one game of the chess substitute and then decided I am not playing Horizon

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,480
 Bidden West in order to play a chess substitute.

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,040
 I am here to shoot machines and stopped.

100
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,080
 Top tip jump.

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,960
 Mark also says, love the chapter art and it would be nice if more of you said that.

102
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,760
 Just saying.

103
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,600
 Please like us.

104
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:37,360
 It's also possible the most visible place for our artwork is not like buried in the chapter

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
 art of the podcast because I don't know about you guys but I don't look at the chapter art

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,920
 on podcasts.

107
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,640
 Sorry.

108
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,400
 Oh, it's kind of the episode art, isn't it, rather the chapter art.

109
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,000
 It's um and it does appear on when we distribute the Fazid people and it will appear at some

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,320
 point we're going to put a fancy with all the artids so you know it's getting out there.

111
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,320
 But when it's kind of when people talk about the podcast on things like um

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,360
 file 770 and E-Fazids they do put our chapter art.

113
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,440
 They put our episode art up with it.

114
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,200
 Mark also says that despite the fact that he would have expected it to come

115
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,520
 embedded behavior he found it very interesting how easy it was to forget to remask

116
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,680
 when you were moving between environments at Easter Com.

117
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,120
 So like the thing he says was you know he'd come out of an environment where he didn't need to

118
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,640
 be master would be struggling on a corridor master and seemingly not really registering all

119
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,240
 the masked people who are walking past him and probably thinking he was some sort of COVID

120
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,960
 denying rebel.

121
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
 And yeah no I know what you mean Mark.

122
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,560
 I did definitely have similar things so it is a good point and well made.

123
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
 He also says that he quite likes the film of mortal engines which I haven't seen but I think

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,760
 Haslam and Will Miranda in it.

125
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,280
 Am I thinking of the right one?

126
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,480
 I don't think you are.

127
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,200
 I'd like to say that I do not think of Mark Plummer as a rebel so they go Mark.

128
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,920
 You're okay.

129
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,320
 Oh I think of him he's absolutely a rebel.

130
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,280
 I don't think he's a COVID denying rebel but rebel yes.

131
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,240
 I've done a control F for Lin-Manuel Miranda on the mortal engines film page and it doesn't come up

132
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,320
 so I think you have invented that entirely in your head John.

133
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,800
 Boo!

134
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
 "Venturing things in Talya was said the best way."

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,920
 Are you just putting Lin-Manuel Miranda into every film?

136
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,880
 Is this your thing now?

137
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,240
 No I think I was looking at Lin-Manuel's filmography I think I was thinking of Mary Poppins

138
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,200
 because they both start with M.

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,720
 I was wondering if you were thinking of Mary Poppins and I didn't want to say

140
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
 righto.

141
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,560
 Because I don't think they've got that much in common except obviously they both set in

142
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,320
 a steampunk London.

143
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,760
 One of which moves.

144
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,880
 We also have a little look from somebody who's volunteered to help me with a secret project

145
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,840
 with Bradley Harris who says "I've listened to some of your opt thought podcast and I love the way

146
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,040
 you British people sadly didn't say that I'm paraphrasing" and I agree with John that Detroit

147
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
 pizza is very good.

148
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,640
 I have food recommendations for Chicago so you can look forward to them.

149
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,880
 Look up Jiborito and I have now looked up Jiborito and I am very excited because that is

150
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,080
 right in my wheelhouse.

151
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:18,720
 I am generally very up for any food that is kind of from Spanish speaking countries I guess.

152
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,240
 Like I've never had a papusa I didn't like and I've been thinking about it and I think I do

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,920
 actually think that this might be nice so I'm looking forward to trying it out.

154
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,080
 They link to Flanderkeso and assuming that that is similar to Flanderkeso you get in Spain I am

155
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
 really well up for that.

156
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,360
 That's just quiche right?

157
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,600
 No.

158
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,600
 I mean but it isn't just quiche because it's sweet it's much more like cheesecake.

159
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,560
 Oh okay.

160
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,000
 So I guess it's like quiche in the same way that a cheesecake is like quiche.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,360
 Okay that's good though.

162
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,520
 It's in the family you know deep dish pizza, quiche, flanderkeso all of these foods have

163
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,080
 similarities but have different contexts.

164
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,400
 Basically what you're saying is that if you have a suitable combination of cheese and carbs

165
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,680
 everything is good.

166
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,800
 I am saying that.

167
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,520
 You're not wrong.

168
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:14,240
 [Music]

169
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,480
 So I've had an interesting experience which I've described in the show notes as I've seen

170
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,520
 Hugo VertiPackits from both sides down which is the last year I coordinated the Hugo VertiPackit

171
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,040
 and had to collect and everything for everyone.

172
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,680
 This year I've submitted a thing to the Hugo VertiPackit with the help of Joel and Liz.

173
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,120
 So it turns out that when we got an email saying "oh congratulations guys you're a Hugo finalist"

174
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,520
 what we should have done is that of squeaking for an hour and texting Liz 47 times

175
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,520
 was immediately start working on a Hugo VertiPackits submission.

176
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,600
 Because what we actually did was a couple of days before the VertiPackit deadline go

177
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
 "oh it's a bit time to get about time we got this together isn't it?"

178
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
 Yeah I had a really torrid three days.

179
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
 Thank you for the extension Cassidy.

180
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,840
 We didn't look at it as kind of a few days before.

181
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,920
 The problem is that we looked at it sort of seven to ten days before and that was not enough time.

182
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
 Yeah that's right.

183
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,080
 We should have, we basically there were things we could have done earlier that might have been better.

184
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
 I think that's fair to say.

185
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,920
 So what went wrong is that we decided we'd better have some transcripts.

186
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,400
 We've been kind of not having transcripts for two years and it's probably time we started

187
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,640
 having transcripts and so we have put four episodes into the Hugo VertiPackit and we have put some

188
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,000
 transcripts for those episodes in and you will be able to download them if you're a

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,560
 check on member when the Hugo VertiPackit comes out but we'll also release it we'll put it somewhere.

190
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,760
 I suggest we'll probably put it on efanseed's so you can go get it there and of course you'd get

191
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,960
 the actual podcast from the podcast site.

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,120
 Transcripts are hard, who knew?

193
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,400
 Yeah it turns out even with the help of you know an automated transcription service

194
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,320
 it gets sufficient stuff either completely wrong or slightly wrong that it still takes a very

195
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,200
 long time to turn the rough text into an actual transcript.

196
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,680
 Hmm yeah and they can mostly tell the difference between me talking, John talking and Alice

197
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,280
 in talking but not always.

198
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,800
 They're very bad in particular at the times when one of us says something and then the other one

199
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:22,080
 says oh no or really or pancakes or something and then and then the first person goes on so all

200
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,040
 of those had to be fished out and made into separate paragraphs.

201
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,120
 Oh no really pancakes.

202
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,000
 Like that.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,720
 It'd be much better if the podcast was actually just a series of monologues and not a conversation

204
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,920
 so we should consider that for easy transcription.

205
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,840
 It turns out that the podcast is quite often a series of monologues as well.

206
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,320
 Do you want to expand on that point Alison?

207
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,320
 I was looking at the transcripts for some other conversational podcasts and it appears that

208
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,520
 those podcasts might not have somebody go off or one and talk solidly for five minutes in the way

209
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,600
 that ours does from time to time.

210
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,240
 This is only if you look at the front of the thing we've put into the Hugo Verte packet

211
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,200
 it just kind of says octa-thorp Hugo Verte packet submission but if you look at the back

212
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,280
 into the colophon the colophon is something that old-time fanzine fans

213
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,200
 printing their fanzines to tell you who's done it and when and why

214
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,240
 so that you can find us information out later.

215
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,160
 It describes the document as an immutable artifact which it is but meanwhile in the

216
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,960
 interim jollers worked out that we are mutable after all.

217
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,080
 Yeah because mutable being a word which clearly means something you can mute.

218
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,280
 You can mute octa-thorp try it now lower your volume to zero I go away I come back

219
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,720
 what crazy magic.

220
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
 Ah it's yes we are mutable but the transcript is not no volume

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,800
 and and it's immutable and will never change that might be a joke.

222
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,360
 True unless we upload a new PDF which we're going to and it's also an e-pub so you can now

223
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,240
 read octa-thorp on your e-reading device.

224
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,640
 I'm not sure why you want to do that really.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,400
 I mean I really like reading e-books or by e-reading device and even I am not doing that so

226
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,480
 please write in if you decide to.

227
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,120
 Alison did occlude something which is early statistics suggest that Alison talks roughly half the time

228
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,000
 on octa-thorp although it does change from episode to episode but it is quite interesting to see

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,960
 the the divisions it will not shock long-term listeners to find that Liz talks usually the

230
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,000
 least of the three of us because she only says things when she's got things to say.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,360
 Yeah I mean this is partly because I like to you know reserve my participation for making

232
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,600
 short pithy and funny statements ideally but it's also because I shirk my duties of introducing

233
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
 any of the letters of comment and leave that off the chat.

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,960
 Oh I mean that is oh no hang on this is a life hack gosh darn it.

235
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,280
 And also I am also prone to monologuing it's just that I tend to find my monologues less

236
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,760
 interesting than other monologues and cut them out preferentially.

237
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,960
 Yeah I think I did I transcribe your uh android netrunner monologue that was uh I don't know.

238
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,080
 Oh it's quite the monologue.

239
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,160
 It might be a villain origin story.

240
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,960
 The other thing about our immutable artifact is that we started doing the transcripts and Liz

241
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,760
 started on we agreed which episodes were going to go into the Hugo VertiPacket and Liz started

242
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,080
 transcribing episode 26 and she wrote several times about how she was transcribing episode 26 so

243
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,080
 I finished episode 26 and then when I'd finished all of the episodes I went to check that we'd got

244
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,720
 the episodes in the drop box for the Hugo people and observed that episode 26 was not one of the ones

245
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,840
 that we put into the Hugo VertiPacket and I had one of those ghastly sinking feelings that you get

246
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,400
 when you go oh oh no so we've actually transcribed five episodes so far and we have in fact transcribed

247
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,800
 six episodes so far because we've also done episode 57 which will really release

248
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,480
 at or around the same time as we do this we have to work out where we're going to put the transcripts

249
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,200
 of things like that.

250
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,880
 Sorry about my brain fart but in my defense I did mention the title of it several times

251
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,960
 and I've been noticed.

252
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:25,600
 Disc on three have translated their souvenir book into Chinese which I remembered

253
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,640
 while we were recording this and I thought it was quite cool I mean I don't really have

254
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,600
 any idea to say on it beyond I think it's quite cool so you know I just thought I'd drop that in there.

255
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,200
 I hope that means that the Chinese supporting members of Disc on will get it and read it and

256
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,840
 find it interesting. Yeah I feel like they might get to the WILK on long list and go

257
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,520
 this is not what I got into satisfaction to read but you know.

258
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,320
 I mean I think it's interesting because like so Disc on have kind of retrospectively translated

259
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,200
 their souvenir book as far as I can see I don't think I kind of translated anything including things

260
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,360
 like the Hugo nomination form and so on in 20 other languages which is interesting because

261
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,600
 should we be routinely providing them in the languages you know of the hosts of the WILKons who can vote.

262
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,680
 Disc on ended up with quite a commitment to getting like auto translations of their events

263
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,880
 into Chinese and things like that so this is something Disc on to take quite seriously.

264
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,240
 I just thought it was really interesting that they'd done the souvenir book I think that's really cool.

265
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,520
 My guess is that if you deal with a set of auto transcripts or auto translation and then have to

266
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,360
 turn it into real translation that's probably not that dissimilar to transcription. It's the same

267
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,600
 sort of it's the same sort of unpleasant finicety task.

268
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,800
 I have a suspicion that my sister who is a translator would would disagree with you

269
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,480
 extremely strongly because you don't have any of the nuance of the language if you convert it.

270
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,520
 You'd have to be better off because idioms don't translate. It's not like in a transcription where

271
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,720
 the idioms would yeah I have a suspicion that it might not be right. I don't know if you are a

272
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,520
 translator right in. Yeah I mean I do think that spoken language is very different from written

273
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,400
 language and the reason that I find transcripts so hard is that I want the written transcript to

274
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,200
 make sense and it the transcription of the Batum speech doesn't always make sense so that's not

275
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,760
 that dissimilar. Oh no really pancakes. I would also say that if you're going for like auto

276
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,320
 transcription then you know Chinese is one of the harder languages I think to do the auto

277
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,160
 transcription into so. Auto translation but yeah. So I had a translation yet so I suspect it

278
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,760
 happened on that. I mean it's also worth noting that you know Chengdu already have a

279
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,560
 translation services division and division head so I'm sure they're already thinking about

280
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,360
 what they're going to need which is a lot of translation. I have not been looking at Chengdu's

281
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,080
 organizational chart but that sounds like an extremely interesting thing to look at.

282
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,840
 Did you not see that they released his turn Estercon? No because I spent Estercon absolutely flat out

283
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,360
 over over committing myself so I mean I've learnt a number of valuable lessons from Estercon.

284
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,280
 I will say listeners and Liz if anything happened during Estercon please tell me what it was and

285
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,160
 you know right in because I was not paying attention to much. Now this is really good thank you for

286
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,720
 the link Liz there's a very interesting picture. I'll put a link in the show notes listeners.

287
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:38,960
 Tchaikon launched their portal for expressing interest in being on programme

288
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,760
 a while back and the deadline was in the last few weeks and all three of us applied to fill in the

289
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,080
 programme questionnaire and then all three of us filled in the programme questionnaire and then

290
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,640
 I think some of us have heard back although I'm not sure whether all three of us have.

291
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,200
 I think all three of us are confirmed on the on the list of programme participants on the

292
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,240
 Tchaikon website so we will all three be programme participants but we don't know what

293
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,360
 programme items we'll get yet. I was down as a programme participant virtually so I've

294
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,440
 emailed them and let them know I'm going so I don't know what that's going to do to which programme

295
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,520
 items I was put on or not because it might mean that all of the ones they thought oh he could be

296
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,400
 on that one they're like oh no that's a virtual one and vice versa no idea sorry programme team

297
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,720
 of Tchaikon 8 that must be very annoying. Do we know anyone on the programme team?

298
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,960
 I don't think so. Liz is shaking her fist. I'm not I'm not a signing panelist so that's okay.

299
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,480
 And the way that Tchaikon's programme participation worked was that in the expression of interest

300
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,960
 you gave like a little bit about yourself and then when you filled in the actual programme you

301
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
 the actual questionnaire you got like a list of all of the things that they were planning to do

302
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:57,920
 and you could choose ones that you were interested in doing. The way it worked is that you could choose

303
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,040
 five that you rated a one and one is like I really really really really want to be on this

304
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,760
 panel and I think I'd be great. You could choose five panels which you rated a two where two was

305
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,640
 kind of I have relevant expertise to this panel and I wouldn't mind not being on it but equally I

306
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,920
 think I'd be good on it and then you could choose as many as you'd like to put three which is basically

307
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:25,600
 yeah I could do that and you could like filter the programme down by various categories. I found

308
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,880
 the filtering slightly annoying because you couldn't filter for instance to programme item type so

309
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,440
 you couldn't filter between workshops and panels when I looked at it and I was like I don't think

310
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,640
 I want to volunteer to do a workshop so I would quite like just to select panels but I don't think

311
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,560
 that was an option but you could do it between kind of different areas of the programme so I

312
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,160
 looked mostly at areas that I was interested in obviously and so I've signed up for a couple on

313
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,720
 fanning podcasting because I am a fancaster and I have signed up for a couple of things like

314
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,800
 Star Wars and other things that I'm very interested in as a fan so yeah we'll see what happens.

315
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,640
 I can say I'm not sure if there were workshops in there to sign up for I think like it was mostly

316
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,880
 things where there would be other people on there as well. I can't remember what I signed up for

317
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,440
 some of the same panels as John sorry John I'm going to fight your forum so I put some fan casting

318
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,040
 panels some con running panels some science panels. I did like how the system was like you could put

319
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,200
 things as number one but you can only have like a certain number as number one because I think

320
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,720
 that does sidestep people saying here are the 27 panels I would be enormously great on

321
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,160
 you have to actually select and you also have to explain why you would be great on them which

322
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,440
 is good because if you can't plausibly write a sentence saying why you would be great on it

323
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,840
 you probably not great on it. Yeah I didn't answer fair. It is quite a

324
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,160
 effort though. In the list of things I hugely disagree with that's one of them but I feel I have

325
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:58,160
 a problem with this entire system which is it is going to make it harder for people who struggle

326
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,840
 with big forms of whom we have quite a lot in tandem to get themselves onto programming and it

327
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:13,440
 is it preferentially suits people who are who are quite methodical and systematic about the way

328
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,640
 they do these sorts of things so I feel like there is a considerable risk that the people who have

329
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,440
 carefully assigned themselves to 75 panels will get more programming than people who are

330
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,560
 absolutely fantastic but can't be asked with forms like this and I think I don't think the

331
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,160
 system is wrong but I think it probably has to be combined with a certain amount of oh we know that

332
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,280
 X is great at Y but they have to be persuaded to do Y or it won't happen they're never going to fill

333
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:50,400
 in a 200 page form. Over on the Hugo finalists discord somebody said well I have a Hugo finalist

334
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,120
 who I've been helping to complete that form but they could not possibly have completed it without

335
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,920
 some support from another person and there is an access issue to forms that require people to

336
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,200
 write a lot of stuff about themselves for people who have trouble writing which this person does

337
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,480
 or for people who have trouble with forms so there's this basically there's a problem with the

338
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,840
 people who are too busy and can't be asked but nevertheless a good one program and there's a

339
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,480
 problem with people with the access issues so there's kind of both of those are in the category of

340
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,520
 problems with the system I have another set of rants though which I'm happy to do later

341
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,840
 I could do as many rants or this as you like. I think the thing isn't you don't you so you're

342
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,320
 looking at this system in isolation and you're not comparing it to the previous system and so

343
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,600
 this system does have a couple of things that are bad about it which you're very neatly elucidated.

344
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,120
 I think in terms of people who have trouble filling in big forms the previous system also has big

345
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,200
 forms so I am not wholly convinced that this system is worse than that but I do think it's

346
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,400
 something we do need to think about and especially from the access perspective when you said about

347
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,560
 people we know would be good I think one of the massive strengths of this system

348
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,000
 I think it's very easy for program to reflect the people that the program team know and I think this

349
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,160
 system does an enormous amount to remove that and to broaden the pool of people out and so I do

350
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,720
 think and if you know there's someone coming who hasn't filled in like I don't know if Chris Evans

351
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,320
 is attending and there's a Captain America panel and he hasn't filled in the form you might gently

352
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,280
 know Jim would be like Chris beyond the Captain America our panel please but I do think one of the

353
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,400
 things this model is clearly trying to achieve is making it easier for the program team to tell

354
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,640
 who would be good on panels that they might not be aware of you know I have big support for all of

355
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,520
 that so I mean I am quite supportive of the aims of some of this stuff yeah I think I am

356
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,640
 you know more persuaded by one of your points than others you know I think the access issue is a big

357
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
 one and I don't know whether it needs to be in bigger letters look if this form is a problem for

358
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,520
 you if you cannot you know easily fill in this form you know if there are no you know getting

359
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,720
 in touch with those because I'm pretty sure they would have said okay someone will like work through

360
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,960
 it with you or we'll you know we can send you the panels in a different format they might be easier

361
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,720
 for you to read for instance if like there's a problem with signing up from on the website and

362
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,800
 you could do them that way so I'm a bit more sympathetic to that one than to the people who are too busy

363
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:21,280
 to fill in big forms because then again it becomes like okay so this person is too busy to fill in

364
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,480
 the forms but we know they're good and they should be on program as opposed to this person is maybe

365
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,080
 two busy fill in forms but we don't know their names so we wouldn't use them for program even though

366
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,880
 they're great no no I think you're preferentially selecting against bestsellers and people whose

367
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,000
 books people actually read in favor of wannabes and I think that is not a sensible thing to do

368
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,840
 I mean I think it's fine to say oh yes we want to broaden the range of people on the thing and have

369
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,000
 participation from more groups and particularly from underrepresented groups and people who we

370
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,360
 might not know about but I think saying oh we've got somebody who's consistently on New York Times

371
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,720
 bestseller list but we're not going to put them on program because they can't be faffed with that

372
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,520
 form is just stupid for the Worldcon I think it's stupid and can you tell us which authors you

373
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,920
 have seen that have been in that category um it's good question because I suspect this is wild

374
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:18,480
 supposition there might be and it may be that it's true but I think that Worldcon is a big enough

375
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,720
 deal to most of the authors in our genre that most of the authors in our genre do do this and the

376
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,640
 ones who don't are the ones who aren't bothering to come to Worldcon and are going to drag and con

377
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,160
 instead it's possible yeah and you could say that there are probably a small number yeah I would

378
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,440
 say there are probably a small number of incredibly high profile people who you would like then assist

379
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,840
 because but in a way it feels like the ones who come to your convention when they could otherwise

380
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,920
 probably be doing like you know personal appearances and signatures for thousands of dollars that

381
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,800
 weekend maybe we do put a bit more effort into making sure they get some some panels without

382
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,400
 having to put too much effort in but the other thing is that those people also tend to have

383
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,280
 a person who works for them who can fill in forms for them oh that's true indeed

384
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:07,280
 Chai Conum Chai Con is on Dragon Con weekend isn't it it certainly could be I know Chai Con 7

385
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,800
 was because they had interlinked programming it is indeed Dragon Con is at the same time as Worldcon

386
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,600
 this year and Worldcon speak kind of avoiding Dragon Con well it's interesting because

387
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,360
 because like I say like because I think I don't know the extent to which that was true

388
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,720
 like a decade ago because obviously I was new and shiny then because Chai Con 7 was my second

389
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,320
 Worldcon I know that Chai Con 7 had like video had like hybrid content where there were program items

390
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,880
 that were shared between the two conventions which was like I have no idea how well that worked

391
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,280
 but I remember thinking it was interesting I don't have a good feel for what the Venn diagram

392
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,240
 between the two conventions is like in terms of potential attendees like because obviously the

393
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,080
 state is massive so I don't I don't know to what extent you hurt your attendance by going up against

394
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,840
 Dragon Con whereas like if there were two big cons in the UK you might be a bit more wary because

395
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,160
 the the potential pool might be lower I don't know as an example Metropole Con which is the Berlin

396
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:10,080
 Con next year has just is just in the process of moving because a large literary festival has

397
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,040
 launched on the same weekend as them and they're like oh no we can't do that interesting interesting

398
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:21,120
 the problem with Dragon Con is not splitting the membership it's splitting the authors

399
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,720
 hmm knowing that is fair it's that and it's the guests of all kinds professionals in the

400
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,280
 science fiction and fantasy field feel they have to go to Dragon Con because it is it is now a

401
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,960
 bigger deal for them than Worldcon also if you're a sad puppy you go to Dragon Con right that's

402
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,120
 my understanding because they're less angry with them I assume so but I don't know and then when

403
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,320
 Scolzy got nominated for a Dragon Award everyone was like what are these Hugo Award winners doing

404
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,240
 in our Dragon Awards it was very much like the Fan Awards but for Dragon Con instead of for Corfloo

405
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,000
 is my impression I mean the Dragon Awards are you know they're kind of like I think they very

406
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,480
 much like to over time be more prestigious than the Hugos I'm not sure that's likely to happen

407
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,120
 because I think awards have a huge first move of advantage and that's why the Hugo's a sad

408
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,200
 procedure yep do you want to do your second rant yeah no my second rant is that I didn't think

409
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,080
 very much of the panel choices and I think that might be because the the program team didn't

410
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,960
 doesn't necessarily reflect all of the different parts of Worldcon programming you might want at

411
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,760
 the point where they put the panel choices together and some of the people on the program team were

412
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,960
 proactive about getting panel ideas in there but that meant that for me it felt quite unbalanced

413
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,040
 and there were also panels that were very much like each other and for example there were like

414
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:54,560
 14 podcasting panels and despite the fact that I am I am a fancaster I feel like having 14

415
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:02,400
 podcasting panels and almost no panels about the actual things that fans do in terms of writing

416
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:08,640
 and art and I don't think I think there might be like one fan art item and there aren't very

417
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,680
 many art items altogether and I felt that there was a clearly clearly I'd not enough thought

418
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:20,640
 had been given a sorry list yet to the balance of things that were on that on that thing so a

419
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,680
 lot of things that I'm interested in in fandom you know that just wasn't very much on the on the

420
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,920
 program about it there wasn't a lot about creating social spaces which is something that I think

421
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,120
 is incredibly interesting and I ask about every single time and it wasn't there and there wasn't

422
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,280
 very much about there's some stuff about quite a lot of stuff about making money but not very

423
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,560
 much about kind of turning your fan hobby into into business and things like that so yeah it was

424
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,280
 just lots of different you know I felt my personal interests were not very well represented on the

425
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:58,160
 on the program and it wasn't because they were too busy with all the fantastic science serious

426
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,280
 science fiction and fantasy content or science content it was because there were a vast number

427
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,080
 of panels that were very like each other on what I thought were quite narrow areas there were I

428
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,960
 don't think there were 14 podcast panels to that why we just like is our duration I think there might

429
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,680
 be more like six or seven and I do think in general podcasting because because casting like takes

430
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,680
 under its umbrella podcasting in the fashion we do it which is currently undergoing a huge

431
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,840
 explosion in popularity especially with companies like Spotify getting into the space

432
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,320
 but it also encompasses stuff like TikTok and YouTube both of which are hugely popular

433
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,760
 and so I suspect that fan casting is by far the most common expression of fanak currently in our

434
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,240
 genre and so I do think if you're gonna wait your program to what people are doing and experiencing

435
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,160
 that probably makes sense for most people but I might be wrong I do I don't know I didn't think

436
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,920
 the panels like there were lots of panels I was like oh you know I wouldn't be good on that but

437
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:01,920
 I'm not sure I thought that there were lots of very similar panels but I don't know Liz what do you

438
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,640
 reckon yeah so I think before we start this we say I am on the Shikon program team although I think

439
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,880
 I only had input into like a handful of actual panels on there I'm not actually working for any

440
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,240
 particular area yeah I thought it was quite nice actually because I think in a way it feels like

441
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,480
 we've had very few panels on podcasting I think we've had like how to start your first

442
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,800
 fanning podcast and a lot of maybe technical things and it felt it was digging into the area

443
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,600
 in a way that you can if you have 10 items that you can't if you have two items and the rest

444
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,680
 it felt quite balanced to me but maybe that's just because it has more things you know about my

445
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,440
 particular niche interests and it does about Alison's particular niche interests I would

446
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,120
 also say there was a big form where you could suggest items so I don't know if you did suggest

447
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,560
 items and they've not taken into account or whether you did you know you didn't suggest it yeah I

448
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:52,160
 mean it is possible that I did not do enough work at the earlier point but I kind of thought that with

449
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,680
 Jo and Edie as guests of honor of the convention there would have been

450
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,480
 significantly more about well there's loads of fanak history no there's there's a very

451
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,360
 small there's a load of stuff about 1946 which isn't really fan history in the sense that fans

452
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,800
 today would think about it because it's 80 years ago but it's exactly the sort of thing that Jo

453
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,880
 and Edie would be really good at talking about um they probably will be good about well they

454
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,320
 might be here but I mean they do a lot of other stuff as well and I didn't think that was

455
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,680
 there was as much as I would have liked to have seen I think it's worth being aware that the

456
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,520
 things you can sign up for are just items you can sign up for and obviously there will be other

457
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,640
 items on the program which have already been you know designed with people in mind and I bet

458
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,360
 there are quite a few of those for the guests of honor and so on um that that may not be there

459
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,360
 for open sign up and so you can't judge the entire program just by the things that you personally

460
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,600
 can sign up to be on oh that's quite useful to know actually yeah that makes sense

461
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,440
 I'm just assuming this but just because I don't see things like guest of honor you like the guest

462
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,960
 of honor interviews are not in there so if they have things specifically like the guest of honor

463
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,000
 said you know I would like to do a conversation with this particular interesting person it's

464
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,160
 probably not there so you don't waste your time signing up for it I think I just kind of have

465
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,320
 an idea of a sort of panelist I think is very good which is that you take a chunk of

466
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,120
 you take some topic in the field and then you take people who come at that topic in the field

467
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,680
 from different perspectives and you get a lot of paddle together and and those topics are quite

468
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:29,200
 broad so a lot of people could sign up for it but there were very few panels on the thing that

469
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,880
 felt like that they felt much more narrow in general and focused in general oh I mean so this

470
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,200
 and this comes back really neatly to an argument we've had about Easticon program where you're like

471
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,400
 we need more better program items and but the thing is that what you regard as better program items

472
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,520
 what you just said sounds bad to me I'd much rather have focused items that actually delve

473
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,320
 into something in enough detail to be interesting rather than just a plethora of super vague items

474
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,840
 where I'm like could be about anything probably not going to go and so I do think that is and I

475
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,760
 can entirely understand why someone would disagree with me don't get me wrong like I am in Thailand

476
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:13,280
 and this is a subjective thing for me but I much more prefer that kind of program to a very kind of

477
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,040
 sort of high level not really delving into any crunch program and it goes back to what Liz was

478
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,640
 saying about the podcast panels which is that I think she's right that having more panels on the

479
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,840
 subject lets you get into that subject better than having a couple of very high level program items

480
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,520
 does and that resonated with me as well so so I think yeah I think this is a perhaps a subjective

481
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,640
 thing I will feel a lot more convinced about this the first time I go to a podcasting item no

482
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:49,040
 matter how deep that does not contain a discussion of which microphone you should buy so so what I

483
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:56,080
 feel is they say they'll delve in but every podcasting item is podcasting 101 and this is why when I

484
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:02,240
 suggested items to the east con just gone a couple of the items I was like and I would like to moderate

485
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,040
 that because if I had not moderated them I think they would have gone into very very

486
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,880
 points and I did not want them to I wanted them to be specific discussions about specific things

487
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,600
 that are interesting and this is something that Esther and Emily were on a panel with me about

488
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,120
 board games and they both read the thing and went oh that's going to end up being tabletop gaming 101

489
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,320
 and I was like it is absolutely not going to end up like that it's going to be a discussion of the

490
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,760
 modern canon it's going to be a discussion of like the modern kind of historical context of the hobby

491
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,680
 and that is the discussion we actually had and I think it was really good but I think I think the

492
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,920
 flip side of that is you've got to have moderators who are willing and able to read the panel description

493
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,440
 and deliver that panel I went to a panel at Dublin which was a really interesting sounding

494
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,480
 panel about animation but there had not been there had been some glitch in the program set up for

495
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,640
 that panel where it was not clear to the panel who the moderator was so I'm all stepped in and

496
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,400
 basically moderated a very vague panel which was entirely dis satisfactory to me rather than the

497
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,120
 interesting panel I had read about in the description and I thought that was a great shame because

498
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:13,680
 the panel as described was fascinating and a panel which is what is genre what is animation is just

499
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:20,320
 like no I've heard this before I'm leaving I agree with you however I agree with this I agree that

500
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,760
 the moderator has a job to do which is to deliver the thing on the sheet though obviously you have

501
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,440
 some scope for digressions like the one we're currently having when they get into an interesting

502
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:40,080
 gritty topic but I also feel that in general if I am creating a program item for a room of size

503
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:47,520
 x I would like to think that it's going to appeal to approximately point x eight of x people at the

504
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,720
 convention and the problem with some of these quite crunchy panels like the excellent one on

505
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:59,840
 on gaming over zoom that you moderated at least con that I really enjoyed being on

506
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,320
 is it attracted to an audience about 10 people and really you could just do those in the bar

507
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,400
 or this question about is it worth really digging in deep into topics to get to get a

508
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,840
 panel really only a very few people will be interested in but they will have a final time

509
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,680
 if alison has a full proof algorithm for working at how big x is prior to the convention you know

510
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,080
 if you can predict the number of people who will come for a panel within like two or three times

511
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,240
 the number of people who actually end up at that panel no not at all absolutely not no chance

512
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,800
 that's the problem because you can say oh I think this might only appeal to 12 people and I'll put

513
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,080
 it in a small room and then you end up with 50 or you say oh this will appear to loads of people

514
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,520
 and then there's 10 people in it so we can do better than we typically do though because we don't do a

515
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,200
 very good job of collecting the data at conventions to then inform future conventions for example

516
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,000
 we felt octothor filled its room at easter con and I don't suppose anyone was expecting that

517
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,160
 including us lots of program items that he's to go to not fill their rooms this is something that

518
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,040
 I would have thought would be useful for future convention committees to know about live podcasts

519
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,440
 in general I don't think it is unique to us I think podcasts have audiences and we know from

520
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,120
 folk clubs that if you if things have existing audiences and you program them people will come

521
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,360
 to them we filled our room at easter con but we were like what maybe a third full at no over con so

522
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,600
 even if you take those two data points I don't know which way you extrapolate from those two I

523
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,240
 just say we filled a room at you know like the item just before the closing ceremony when there

524
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,080
 wasn't very much on if you would put us on you know maybe at 2 p.m. on the Saturday I don't think

525
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,800
 we would have filled the room so again it's like a very complex arrangement of things I probably

526
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,920
 would be better if we had better notes of how many people there were in rooms but we need an

527
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,960
 organized way to do that because the basically the volunteers are too stretch kicking people out

528
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,360
 of rooms at the right time to count how many people are in there no I think you require the

529
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:00,800
 moderator to report back yeah and most of them would Alison is entirely right because I do think

530
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,600
 one of the things we're very weak at in con running generally is analytics I like you have

531
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,960
 arguments about so many different things where people are like I assert X and someone else is

532
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,960
 like I assert Y and you're like is there any data to give us any perspective on which of these

533
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,160
 assertions is more valid and there is none because we don't we don't collect that data and part of

534
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,040
 that is because it's difficult it's difficult to collect data and that's why like market research

535
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,760
 firms are phenomenally expensive and well out of the reach of like anyone running a convention or

536
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,400
 maybe not a WorldCon but definitely like at an East con level it's difficult because most of the

537
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,880
 data capture would be being done by volunteers and I think you're right that most

538
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,120
 moderators would report back but like there is a weak link there but it's also difficult in

539
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:52,960
 that most of the analyzing the data would need to take place quite soon post con and we know that

540
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,920
 people tend to be very burnt out post con and I think the longer you leave it the more risk you

541
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,640
 have of not realizing you need some number that you haven't collected and then being like oh no

542
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,520
 and I've had this experience from public engagement data analysis where you do your analysis sort of

543
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,080
 a year after you wrapped up the engagement and then you're like oh it would really have been helpful

544
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,760
 if I had thought of taking that number at the time so I do I do think this is a weakness in

545
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,480
 fandom but I understand why it's a weakness in fandom and I don't have any useful suggestions

546
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,680
 for things we could do about it well you need a specific team to take charge of it and know

547
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,200
 that they're going to do most of their stuff after the convention so preferably a different set of

548
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,680
 people are not working pre con I think would be the way to do it the more data you gather during

549
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,520
 the convention the better if you gather the raw data during the convention and then store it somewhere

550
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,440
 it's it's there when people want it um it can be really simple things like the number of points

551
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,360
 of beer we sold today nobody ever wants to do this after the convention they want to do it

552
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:59,120
 during the convention well I think Liz might be right having like a specific team of people that

553
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:04,000
 don't have any pre con responsibility and just work post con might be a good way of kind of

554
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,960
 sidestepping the burnout problem a little bit and and and maybe this is something like we should

555
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,960
 be you know looking at doing I don't know maybe this is a thing that people could think about

556
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,160
 our con-running knowledge base which is the thing that requires people to work post con is way out

557
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,520
 of date and I've had some things about what we can do about improving that and indeed it is to

558
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,200
 find people who want to do the work and want to do it off to the call and make it their only job

559
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,640
 but it's it's so far down the list of projects I want to get into that I haven't really done

560
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,120
 anything else with it but if anyone listening with this and thinks oh gathering this information

561
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,960
 would be a really interesting project they should get in touch I would like to volunteer whoever

562
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,280
 chairs the 2025 e-stick on come and talk to me after 2024s over because this might be something

563
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,480
 I'd be quite interested in getting involved but I'm not going to do anything before it's 2024 so

564
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,680
 so I feel like a bigger problem is getting a team together to bid 25 oh yeah I mean I'm definitely

565
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,720
 not volunteering to take a leadership role in that and I wanted to just say have right Liz is about

566
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:17,520
 room size estimates being a dark art because that clearly even if we got fantastic data forever

567
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,080
 it would still be impossible and I do accept that I mean there is the the alternate approach

568
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,200
 to room size which is to just have a convention where every room isn't I for because you've got

569
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:35,760
 too many people very simple we will call that the loncon model our loncon model Helsinki model

570
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,800
 I was about to call it the anti-covid model but then it might actually be pro-covid in all the

571
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,520
 wrong ways so uh I think we should be getting better at this now it happened because we started

572
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,480
 publishing programs in advance of the convention and it turns out that if you program publish your

573
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,040
 program in advance of a convention people read it and identify things they'd like to go and see

574
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,200
 and go and see them and the uptake of program is vastly higher than it traditionally wasn't at

575
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,200
 UK convention certainly where traditionally the program was something that very many people

576
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,440
 ignored was in the bar and it is much less so now people go to program items in larger numbers

577
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,000
 because the program is more public oh no I don't know if it's because the program is more public I

578
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,920
 think it's whole different conversation about the fact that people tend to go to more program now

579
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,800
 possibly more program when they've only been to a few Wilcons so but we might be drifting too far

580
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,080
 off the topic of program like software model um well thank you very much for this discussion

581
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,240
 since I have volunteered for at least one item at Chicon about convention programming

582
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,440
 and so we'll see if I get on that and then can recurgeitate all your opinions as my own thank you

583
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,600
 no worries if you need um any panelists for program items listening if you need us to do your

584
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,120
 homework for you write in with the name of the panel you need to pre-chat for and we'll give it a

585
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:02,080
 good go preferably things we know about but we're not proud when you was like I assert this and I

586
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,680
 assert that but there's no data and I'm kind of like well it's probably good thing there's no

587
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,440
 data because we had data we wouldn't have a podcast would we no I was also thinking about that but

588
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,440
 no I was thinking about like in terms of modeling it is so difficult to model stuff like this even

589
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,840
 when you have good data like there's there's like the whole field of machine learning where you're

590
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,600
 basically just trying to predict stuff like this like using enormous amounts of data so trying to

591
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:34,720
 do it with literally no data is phenomenally difficult so if you're a convention out there and you're

592
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,760
 trying to do a machine learning model where you put all the audiences for panels into your machine

593
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,760
 learning model and then generate panel names that will get a lot of people to go along to them um

594
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,720
 do let us know because I know that somebody's done the first part of that where they put all the

595
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,360
 panel names in and identify a node of new panels like things like cake in science fiction discuss

596
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,360
 so the way that you do machine learning clarification is you like give everything a tag and then you

597
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:09,040
 develop an algorithm that can basically spit out like what tags are associated with what trends

598
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,080
 and so that would let you say like if I have ex guest of honor who I've got data from previous

599
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:21,440
 conventions and if I've got ex subject matter so say fan casting or fan art or science can I then

600
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,560
 predict like what the likely what the likely attendance of a science panel with this guest of

601
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,240
 honor on it is for instance and that that starts getting you into kind of interesting things but

602
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,080
 it also means you can be valuable judgments about how many fan art panels do we have will that capture

603
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,480
 enough of a audience Liz are you going to tell us do pics no I was actually going to digress even

604
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:52,000
 further hey excellent have you seen a video from a youtube channel defunct land about fast pass

605
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,320
 the disney system essentially for trying to minimize people's wait time in line for rides because in

606
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:04,080
 order to do that extremely lengthy video they basically set up a model of a theme park you know

607
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,080
 in which they could give the guests different behaviors and you know model all the attractions

608
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:13,120
 and the activities you could do and then have this sort of each person is therefore like a different

609
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,920
 model of behavior and what they like to do you know do they want to go on as many rides as possible

610
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,880
 with minimal waiting or do they really want to do the three rides they want to do and they don't

611
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,520
 mind waiting and basically set up as a model of an entire theme park so maybe we need that look

612
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:32,000
 for a convention and it's probably something it's on get we can nick it oh yes excellent no i'm

613
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,160
 i'm suddenly very excited about this yeah no we're crowdsourcing this guys because we're not going

614
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,240
 to do it at least not till 2025 i mean to be fair genuinely if i was not on an easter

615
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,360
 con committee this would be my next project but i am i know i'm gonna have to say no because um

616
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:53,040
 oh that sounds fascinating it's quite good yeah sounds good but that's the other thing on the

617
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,000
 trycon on the trycon program and i'm not just trycon like i've not seen any discussions about

618
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,840
 how to try to improve conventions using data like i don't think that's a conversation anyone's

619
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,400
 having and i think did you suggest it john i did not because i only just thought about

620
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,480
 alison but i will suggest it can you suggest it to 2023 please for the easter con thank you

621
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:30,880
 picks so um who wants to go now alison and i you're having a fight and i'm staying out of it

622
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,880
 we both want to pick the same movie we had a we had a we i was like i i did cause dips on this first

623
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,680
 and john was like i saw it first and then john was like well i've been doing hugo reading so what i

624
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:52,000
 am showing the camera is i'm showing the camera a paper cut in between my thumb and my forefinger

625
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,800
 which i believe means i can transition to the multiverse in which i win this argument oh

626
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,720
 whereas i'm like going this is a film about a harried middle aged businesswoman with

627
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,360
 who is distractible and overworked with a with um a dependent and irascible parent and

628
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:16,000
 aimless but bright lesbian daughter and um and uh extremely devoted and kind but perhaps

629
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,640
 slightly dull husband and i felt seen not as much as your family do now

630
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,560
 but my family have all heard this joke at least once already actually might have mentioned

631
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,200
 uh so for the listeners who haven't worked out we're talking about everything everywhere all at

632
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:40,240
 once which is great i quite liked it i thought it was really good i like representation of movies

633
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,600
 and there aren't enough movies about middle aged women who are michelle yo that's true i mean not

634
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,640
 even tomorrow never dies because she's quite young in that yeah and she's she's older than i am and

635
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,320
 she is vastly more flexible than i am i think it's safe to say

636
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:00,960
 more flexible than any of us i think it's safe to say i think and i'm the subject of representation

637
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,920
 this is actually something i said to i would see it with uh friends of the podcast Neil and Nick

638
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,040
 i said afterwards i thought one of the things i really liked about the movie was that waymund

639
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:18,000
 really neatly encapsulates my basic like perspective on life and i very much liked that because

640
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,360
 it's not often you see that perspective presented in movies but it's really not

641
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,440
 often you see that perspective presented as not the easy choice and then there's a real

642
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,880
 i really liked having someone say like it's good to be positive and happy all the time but it's not

643
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:37,120
 easy and i i very much resonated with that i like that an enormous amount in terms of representation

644
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:43,120
 but i suspect you felt more seen than i e allison i did there's also there's also some of the topics

645
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:49,840
 of the movie about i don't think this is spoiling too much one of the big themes of the movie is

646
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:56,400
 whether you could make different life choices and and experience better or a different life as a

647
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,600
 result of them and also whether anything has any purpose whatsoever and i am a stage in my life

648
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,800
 well obviously i do grapple with that sort of thing i think that i think this comes and goes

649
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:13,440
 throughout one's whole life i don't think it's just that i think evilin is is meant to feel like a

650
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,960
 very relatable character for a lot of people i don't think it is just people like me well and is as

651
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,920
 as john says an amazing character as well and i thought he was fantastic which is probably quite

652
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:33,840
 good for my marriage because i do have a somebody who evokes many of wahman's ways of living as a

653
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:40,480
 husband which is good and i really liked all of that and i don't want to spoil the movie too much

654
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:47,680
 but i did i'm going to tell you another funny story which is that i wasn't spoiled for this

655
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:54,160
 movie going in at all really so all i knew about it was that it was a movie where

656
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,400
 michelle yoh has adventures in the multiverse and saves the world and so i basically said a

657
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,040
 text to john saying i'm really looking forward to a seagull movie where um there's a bat

658
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,040
 mid-laged woman that's not all about her relationships with her parents and children and her husband

659
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:16,320
 and john was like spoiler i said spoiler and then in spoiler text i said in fact the movie is entirely

660
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:21,280
 about that and then allison said oh i i would have worth that hour if i thought about it and i like

661
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,640
 but i felt really bad because i was like i don't want to harsh your i don't want to harsh your

662
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,360
 squee and i don't want to spoil the movie for you and but i really feel well like but i am gonna need

663
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:36,240
 to warn her that maybe it's not pure escapist fun uh in in some aspects yeah there was enough

664
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:42,480
 escapist fun that it didn't it wasn't all it wasn't it wasn't too too dare beat for me it will be your

665
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,080
 next year's hugo ballad you heard it here first i mean i did not hear it first this now i heard

666
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:54,160
 it in other places also two other things on the letterboxed page for everything everywhere all at

667
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,120
 once the little reviewed icon is a little googly eye that follows your mouse around the page which i

668
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:04,640
 thought was brilliant uh lovely attention to detail googly eyes are sort of a motif of the movie

669
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:12,160
 les i'm going to pick a young adult fantasy geology which is ray bearer and redemptor by

670
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:19,840
 jonnie fueco which are low sound omones from uh 2021 and 2022 and i've read these recently and

671
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:24,960
 really quite enjoyed them i'm struggling to start with where to describe them because there is just

672
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:32,560
 so much in them but essentially the idea of the ray bearer is in this fantasy culture which is

673
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:39,520
 very heavily derived from west african uh cultures i think the ray bearer is kind of the emperor figure

674
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:46,000
 who has the magical power of the ray this allows him to essentially speak psychically to a council

675
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,800
 that he picks as a child and once he's kind of bonded them to him with this psychic power

676
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:57,600
 he's also immune to many methods of injury and death and all of his council are linked together

677
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:03,520
 and cannot be apart from each other so that's kind of the premise which is that the the main character

678
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:11,120
 charisai is brought in to be one of the new young emperors council but she's actually been raised

679
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:16,160
 to be an assassin who will who will kill the the young emperor before he ever takes the throne

680
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,560
 but it turns out that the actual origin of the ray bearer has been shrouded and hidden and changed

681
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,400
 and actually it's a lot more complicated than that and by the end of the first book kind of the

682
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,320
 situation in the world has changed substantially the the redemptors are children who are essentially

683
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:38,080
 sacrificed into the underworld in order to placate the demons who live there and a very few of them

684
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,400
 basically make it out again and are the redemptors i really only got into kind of like half of the

685
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,040
 stuff which is in these books so also i forgot so that all the council have like a special power

686
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,240
 called the hallow her power is to kind of read the memories from people and objects and this is an

687
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,600
 absolutely crucial part of the story it's basically just two books absolutely crammed with stuff all

688
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,040
 around the central character of charisai but i think even though it is crammed with stuff it's

689
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,280
 still very well focused on the central character and the kind of journey she goes on and a lot of

690
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,120
 questions about where does all the power and privilege come from in this empire who has it

691
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:16,160
 and what can you do when you are given power and can you know choose to radically reshape the world

692
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,960
 or not and we know what happens if you try and radically reshape the world but the toll on yourself

693
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,200
 is too great and then the toll on the people who love you and the people around you when you take

694
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:30,480
 that on yourself and so yeah i just i really enjoyed both books i think they're kind of in a way

695
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,600
 that antidote to our early discussion with allison about books being stretched out over a trilogy

696
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,280
 and that i think this possibly could have been a trilogy there was enough stuff in there and it

697
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,360
 feels like a lot of things happened from page to page and there's a lot you could go more deeply

698
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:48,000
 into and characters who sort of you know prominent in one book and then fade out in the second maybe

699
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,920
 because as even more characters are introduced to take their part in the story there's not enough

700
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,160
 room for them but they were just they they felt like an incredibly fallen realized world in a way

701
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:04,080
 that maybe you don't always get no i agree with all the things you just said i liked both books

702
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:10,720
 and enormous amount um i really like so that the idea is that there are 12 ways to die other

703
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,480
 than old age and you have 11 members of your council so you're born with one immunity and

704
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,120
 then every member you appoint you get another immunity and when you complete your council you are

705
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:27,520
 impervious to to death except for from old age uh which i thought was really cool concept

706
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,720
 i very much like the i like it and always thought about things i can't really talk about here

707
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:39,280
 because they're spoilers um but i very much liked uh various parts including a lot of discussion

708
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:48,960
 about how how power manifests and how sometimes it's important to wield that power in different

709
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,800
 ways that aren't always through the proper channels i think i think the book especially the

710
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:58,800
 second book has quite a lot to say about kind of protest and about um power structures and how

711
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:04,880
 tying into existing power structures isn't always the way to affect change um and i agree with you

712
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:12,240
 like i i do think that could well have been uh three books um the first book kind of ends at a

713
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,680
 point where a lot has happened to change the world and then the second book kind of explored the

714
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,600
 ramifications of that which i quite liked um and i i think probably this is my favorite of the two

715
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:29,200
 load star finalists i've read so far i think it probably just about edges uh snakes that felt

716
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:35,440
 at earth although both were fantastic um so yes i'm very much enjoying the load star slate so far

717
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:42,720
 yes i haven't read all the load star um all the load star not many's yet i've only read um the

718
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,960
 last graduate and i think i would pick redempt a wave of the last graduate at the moment yeah i

719
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,280
 should say it could be it could be a trilogy but i'm quite glad it's not i think i preferred reading

720
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,360
 two books that were stuffed full of energy rather than and they felt like there was still enough time

721
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,800
 for the characters to to breathe and for all these kind of big questions to be considered um

722
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:09,520
 and yeah it did feel like it was the right length still yeah i i think i agree i like duologies okay

723
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,560
 yeah no i quite like duologies um we'll talk about that more when we talk about hugo books i think

724
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:22,320
 and that was the octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye

725
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,320
 from me

726
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,280
 you won't see it in my old stomping ground oh yeah and i saw it at a john cox and shrine which was

727
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,200
 quite interesting which is the showcase cinema in petebra it's not a shrine it's just a place i

728
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:00,800
 used to work it has lovely seats i did not recline my seat all the way because i'd had quite a

729
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:07,760
 strenuous weekend and we were we were squeezing the movie in by kind of driving down the a1 going

730
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,120
 where is the movie showing between here and London that we can get to at the right time which is how

731
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,240
 can we ended up in petebra and i was very worried that if i reclined by seat all the way back i would

732
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,760
 fall asleep for three hours and that would be a bit of a shame allison did also say that she should

733
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,560
 in hindsight have asked me which cinema in petebra to go and see it at and i did point out that this

734
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:34,240
 is a very London centric view of how many cinemas there are in any given city there are more cinemas

735
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:40,560
 in waltland state of the petebra now the theme music for this episode was fanfare for space by
