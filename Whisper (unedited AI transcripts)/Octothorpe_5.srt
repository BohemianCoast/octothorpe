1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Oh, and the other thing I've learned is I can't sit back in my chair because it does this.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 And it turns out that you can hear that on the recording.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,520
 So if I leave that when I'm speaking, very difficult to add out.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:22,080
 Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,520
 And welcome to episode five of the Oxford podcast, a podcast about science fiction and SF fandom.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,920
 I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,400
 I'm Alison Scott.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,560
 And I'm Liz Batty.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,360
 And we have a letter of comment this week from Claire Breiley of Croydon.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,720
 And one of the things she asks is, why do we always go John Allison Liz?

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,480
 Alison and Liz, do you want to reveal the secrets behind the curtain?

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,440
 It's because if we don't go John Allison Liz then.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,520
 Then Alison and I talk exactly the same time.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,640
 And every time we try and do it again, we again talk exactly the same time and dissolve in

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,760
 Fitzgiggles and John Francis.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,400
 And says we have to do it again.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,400
 The beauty of having you record on separate tracks is actually that I can make it sound

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,000
 like you didn't talk at the same time.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,720
 But yes, it does sound weird when you're listening to it lie.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,200
 Yeah, but Claire is very observant and noticed that we do this.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,920
 But yes, that is indeed the reason.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
 Claire also gave us some corrections.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,760
 So she noted that we got the fan fund bounty stuff.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,280
 Slightly wrong last week.

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,680
 I did put that in the show notes because I realised I had done it wrong while I was talking about it.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:43,920
 But she noted that Fanac doesn't cover the Guff trip reports and sci-fi still does.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,160
 And their five years run from the date of the trip rather than from the date of winning the fund.

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,800
 So that's good news for Alison.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
 Because the date of the trip may be five years after winning the fund.

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,400
 Indeed.

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,480
 The other thing that Claire mentioned is that she very carefully stores all of her Hugo

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,360
 Fidalis pins together and knows precisely where they are, which is extremely organised.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,720
 Alison, do you have any relevant anecdotes about Hugo pins and the care they're off?

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,960
 Well, I was thinking about the care of Hugo pins because I have a neighbour who makes giant

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,480
 public artworks out of little mosaic tiles and she normally generates these tiles in big

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,600
 community workshops and I've never quite managed to get to one of them.

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,440
 These are beautiful and I will put a link to them on the show notes and you can be amazed.

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,120
 They are exactly what public art should be like.

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,560
 And in lockdown she worked, she started off being a bit depressed that she couldn't have

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,920
 these big community workshops.

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,400
 And then she realised that she could roll out a lot of tiny little mosaic tiles and put

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,520
 them in boxes wet for local families to pick up and then stamp out the tiles using tools

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,080
 they find around the house and then return them.

44
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,400
 And I so I have stamped out a load of tiles and a load of things around the house that

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,480
 are important to me and to my family, including one of my Hugo pins.

46
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,520
 Claire is inert, it won't have done it any permanent damage.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,760
 It does have quite a bit of clay on it now, but you know, I think that'll be OK.

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,760
 Not only do I not keep my Hugo pins carefully, but I did manage to find one so I thought

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,640
 that was quite good and I will brush the clay off it.

50
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,560
 But I also don't tend to look after them very well for which I'm sorry I know it's very

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,240
 important and I should be very grateful of the pin.

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,400
 My other Hugo-abusive note is that of course the very first thing I did after winning Hugo,

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,800
 apart from brandishing it on a upper deck of a bus, was play ring toss with it.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,640
 Would you get a bus tour of London when you won a Hugo?

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,000
 Like the cricket team?

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,320
 We got a bus tour of Glasgow which is just as good.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,280
 It's amazing, I didn't know that.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,400
 We won the Hugo's at the SECC.

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,360
 The party was somewhere else in Glasgow.

60
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,120
 Was it in the party hotel in Glasgow?

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,880
 It was in the party hotel and so we got driven by double deck of us.

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,480
 So the plot to Cabal were on the top of the double deck of us waving air, Hugo's around

63
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,120
 and and and George RR Martin was there waving his Hugo around.

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,000
 And I asked him whether the next book was coming out which was probably very bad.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,240
 And the next book did come out but not the one after.

66
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,840
 So you know, there we go.

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,160
 And then we went to the Hugo party and it was full of authors and kind of a bit dreary

68
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,720
 and so we came back to the fan lounge in the Motast Ex to the SECC which is really where

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
 we should have been all along.

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,080
 But we wouldn't have wanted to miss out on riding around on the top of the bus.

71
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,920
 Obviously the population of Glasgow came out through Ticotay Patos.

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,120
 No they did not.

73
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,600
 But we had mentioned it.

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
 Fair enough.

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,160
 It was one of the best nights of my life I have to say.

76
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,120
 I strongly recommend witty Hugo's.

77
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,680
 I think I also played Ring Toss at the 2005 Worldcon.

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,000
 I think I was standing kind of on the balcony around the lobby of the party hotel in Glasgow

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,120
 who's now my have forgotten with a bunch of I think they were like glow sticks and trying

80
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,000
 to throw them at people down in the lobby.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,720
 Didn't do that very long though.

82
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,840
 I mean I think the glow sticks rings a bell because I was like well what will be using for

83
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,320
 the rings and I think it was in fact glow stick.

84
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,520
 So I think we must have had those little glow sticks that you clip together and push out.

85
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,800
 Somebody who's a proper fan of history and is going to remember this is some detail and

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 write to us.

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,200
 I suspect it will be what Claire Bradley have coidded.

88
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,520
 Before we end the anecdote I should say I was throwing the glowing at someone who was

89
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,560
 expecting me to throw the glowing at them not like completely random people standing

90
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,440
 in the hotel lobby which would not be correct.

91
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
 That's fair.

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,320
 The other thing I remember from that night is that Corey Doctorow was like oh my god

93
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,400
 can I hold your Hugo?

94
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,640
 So that tells you approximately how old this anecdote is.

95
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,960
 The Hugo is just a physical representation of things that actually matters which is the

96
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,480
 acclimation of your friends and peers.

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,280
 What we're interested in is validation emotionally.

98
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,840
 We're not interested in physical artifacts a lot to the thought.

99
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,520
 We are interested in emotional wellbeing.

100
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,800
 So do tell us how marvellously podcast is because we really care about that.

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,280
 Please, please tell us how great we are.

102
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,480
 I will know also that I have highly materialistic so I do achieve my emotional wellbeing by

103
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,360
 acquiring more things so that is a whole conflict of interest.

104
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,840
 We should talk about Conzeland because since we last discussed Conzeland in any great detail

105
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,320
 they have announced what it is they're doing for worldcon during the pandemic.

106
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,640
 So they have a streaming partner which is the and this is a URL.

107
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:37,600
 This is a band name which is watch.thefantasy.network, end of URL and they have a new pricing structure

108
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,960
 which is £150 or they're about for an attending membership so approximately $200.

109
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,640
 How do we feel about the fact that the Conzeland attending membership is roughly the same as

110
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,280
 the discount 3 attending membership given the fact that one of those is not happening

111
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,440
 in the real world but inside the space?

112
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,720
 I don't think that's a fair comparison because the Conzeland attending membership is the actual

113
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,960
 front up right up to the convention attending membership whereas the discount 3 one is going

114
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,600
 to be a lot lower than the discount 3 membership will be this time next year.

115
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,800
 So you're not quite comparing like to like but it is certainly not cheap and when I talked

116
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,320
 last time about my experience of EasterCon being that I didn't go to any programming

117
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,000
 and then partnered with my friends every night so it was almost exactly the same as a real

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,240
 EasterCon and I drank too much ale.

119
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,480
 So it was exactly the same as a real EasterCon apart from the fact that I ended up in my

120
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 own bed at home and didn't have to manage hotels and things but also nobody cooked me

121
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,080
 enormous breakfast which was a bit of a shame.

122
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:57,840
 I do wonder that for people like me who habitually don't attend a lot of the programme, I am

123
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,040
 Conzeland accompanying my membership as the Guff delegate and I am extremely grateful

124
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
 to them.

125
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
 Thank you very much.

126
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,760
 That is very kind of them and I will come along and of course I'll be on programme

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,400
 and I will do programme-y things during the programme time.

128
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,440
 We're going to talk a bit about Guff later but for people who aren't me but who are kind

129
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,560
 of party type fans I do slightly wonder if the primary benefit of a WorldCon for you

130
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,160
 is the socialisation structure, what it is that you get for your attending membership.

131
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,680
 So they do say that as part of their collaboration with the Fancy Network that they're going

132
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,680
 to try and have some as well as the panels and video they will also have networking and

133
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,120
 late night hanging out and informal hangouts as well which I think they're right that is

134
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,440
 like a key part of the WorldCon. You can't just put on some streams of panels and replicate

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,840
 the WorldCon experience. You have to include some ways for people to hang out and network.

136
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,120
 I think I'm quite pleased to see that they've got this partnership going because it sounds

137
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,800
 like they've got some people who have really experienced doing sort of video on demand

138
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,360
 and so it will be, I presume, all quite nicely done.

139
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
 There won't be a lot of this.

140
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,480
 Hello are we all on Zoom? Can you hear me?

141
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,520
 Oh you're on mute, please unmute yourself. It will presumably work nicely which I think

142
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,160
 is something worth paying for and maybe they have a really good way that they do sort of

143
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,280
 informal hanging out and social spaces with their current membership.

144
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:27,920
 But I do think that £150 is probably more than I want to pay for that experience.

145
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,360
 That's fair. I think it must be very tricky if you're the Consi-land Committee because

146
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,960
 I imagine that £150 is how much they need to charge to make this work and that is a

147
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,480
 tricky thing to get past if you can't sell people on the value.

148
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,440
 Obviously they haven't announced what they're doing in terms of the programming or any details

149
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
 about the social spaces.

150
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,920
 Last episode or perhaps episode before we were talking about how much you could attend

151
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,480
 in terms of programming a day. I think Liz had been on a training course and found it

152
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,520
 quite exhausting to do 8 hours of content in a single day virtually.

153
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,720
 So lastly's first, how do you think you can do programming a world con over 5 days in

154
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,720
 a way that won't be exhausting in a similar way?

155
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,160
 Well I guess the question is what do people normally do at WorldCon because I think most

156
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,400
 people do not go and do 8 hours of program on a regular WorldCon day and I think it'll

157
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,160
 be much the same as I would do at WorldCon which is you might pop into one panel or two

158
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,480
 panels that you really want to see and then you'll go and have learnt and then maybe

159
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,880
 you'll intend to go to a panel but you'll end up hanging out in the bar instead and so

160
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,760
 actually you'll go to maybe three or four panels or items and spend the rest of time

161
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
 chatting to people.

162
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,080
 I think there are a lot of people who do go to conventions and spend a lot of time in

163
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,320
 the program literally 8 hours especially when they first get into fandom and do that

164
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,240
 Gosh wow oh boy oh boy oh boy oh thing I think your first few conventions you do in fact

165
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,720
 hit panels continuously I mean I still talk to people who have been around a few years

166
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,440
 who sit there checking off things on a program book and going well I want to see all these

167
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,440
 things I think even more than usual when the WorldCon program book comes out and people

168
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,440
 see what's there I think you're going to get a lot of people wanting to go to a very

169
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,280
 large number of sessions and I think at that point they'll get a flush of people joining

170
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,560
 as they realise that they can actually see some very exciting people in environments where

171
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,640
 they wouldn't necessarily otherwise see them.

172
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,960
 There are other organisations that already have virtual events of this kind that are

173
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,640
 very successful a lot of gaming and esports things do do virtual conventions and have

174
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,040
 virtual access and they charge quite a lot of money for it and people are very happy

175
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,880
 because they're not incurring the costs of a hotel and all your meals and your travel

176
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,960
 so you get all of that experience of hearing your favourite authors talking to each other

177
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,000
 but without any of the on costs and I think for a lot of people that is quite a good value

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,280
 proposition and it will be fine and they will have a marvellous programme and people will

179
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,360
 be amazed by that.

180
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,840
 That's my gut feeling of that I don't know what they're actually planning to do.

181
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,400
 I mean the other part is that I would usually spend some of that time hanging out in the

182
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,200
 dealers room looking at things I can't afford to buy but I can replicate that online.

183
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
 One thing they are actually planning to do is have a virtual dealers room and I know this

184
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,360
 because I'm doing a little bit of the playtesting on being a virtual dealer which is coming up.

185
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,360
 The other thing that Liz mentioned is the idea that you would go to a panel and then

186
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,160
 end up talking to friends in the bar.

187
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,760
 How do you replicate the experience of doing that in a virtual convention?

188
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,560
 Do I either of you have any ideas?

189
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,560
 I assume they have to try and replicate it but...

190
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,920
 I have an idea based on Anna Raftery's trip report sessions which you can come and see

191
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,880
 where we have been running the trip report sessions in Zoom and then having a bar session

192
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,360
 afterwards.

193
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,280
 What you could do for the worldcon, and I don't know whether they've got this planned

194
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,400
 but I am offering it to them as a suggestion, is after each event you could then have a

195
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,600
 break into the bar that then breaks into smaller groups so that people can have sensible conversations

196
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,320
 and you could just make that part of what you do for every single item because that's

197
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
 how real conventions work.

198
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,240
 People have an item and then they go off and chat about it in the bar with their mates

199
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,720
 or people that haven't met yet.

200
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,240
 So I was looking a bit more at the fancy network team who will be assisting, I think,

201
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,760
 or running or whatever with Consilend and they have things like they have a Discord channel,

202
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,520
 they do stuff over Twitch where there will be, you know, you can watch the chat and watch

203
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,720
 the item at the same time.

204
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,280
 So I think it won't just be, we all sit and watch Zoom.

205
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,880
 It might be sort of interactive and we are chatting at the same time and then we can go

206
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,440
 on Discord and form a channel to chat about whatever subject we want to later on.

207
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,820
 You know, you could even have Discord channels which are going to be okay, so this is Alison's

208
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,000
 party room and everyone who wants a party with Alison and her friends this evening can

209
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,120
 go in Alison's party room.

210
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,520
 I mean, there will be some issues because normally this is not kind of completely open

211
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
 to everyone.

212
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,600
 You know, sometimes you go and sit in the bar and have a conversation with friends and

213
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,260
 that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone in the convention is going to walk up and

214
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,760
 join that conversation with you and your friends.

215
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,640
 And so I don't know quite how you manage those sort of social spaces which are not kind of

216
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,280
 public to everyone but people can kind of wander in and out.

217
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,240
 But it does seem like they've got a good handle on the sort of tools that might help

218
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
 them do that.

219
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,160
 I think Alison's right that the Anna model will work very well, kind of laying people

220
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,960
 break into social groups after panels.

221
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,040
 My concern I think is firstly that means you have to go to panels in order to enjoy

222
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,020
 the social space which is a slight change from how conventions are normally structured.

223
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,260
 And secondly, I think that it does mean that there's no equivalent to wandering through

224
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,900
 the bar and spotting someone you want to talk to if that makes sense.

225
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,980
 If you don't see someone in the same panels as you, you're not going to bump into them.

226
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:10,020
 For the virtual first Thursday meetings I've done, I've experimented or I am experimenting

227
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:17,100
 with streaming the list of who is in the bar to Twitch so that when people come into the

228
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,700
 room they can go, who's in the bar already?

229
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,060
 Oh, there's these tables and they've got these people at them.

230
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,060
 Now, if you can't do that for a Worldcon, I mean you can do it to some extent but you

231
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,260
 can't really do it for a Worldcon because we have a load of people at Worldcon so if

232
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,780
 you did that they would kind of do the virtual equivalent of turning their badge around.

233
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:41,220
 You know, they don't want random fans to be able to come up and talk to them quite all

234
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,020
 the time or much of the time because they would be mopped.

235
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,060
 And at that point you could have people say, "Oh, and if you don't want to be on the list

236
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,100
 of who's in the bar so people can't see that you're there, let me know and I'll make sure

237
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,740
 your name's not on that list."

238
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:59,140
 So we've got some scope for, but it's still a very blunt hammer compared with the joy

239
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,580
 of being able to go through a bar and see people you want to talk to but it's quite a

240
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,380
 refined hammer compared with the not joy of being able to go through a bar and discovering

241
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,180
 those 200 people in it and not being able to see the people you want to talk to because

242
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,180
 it's too crowded.

243
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,980
 Ooh, and I don't know if this is secret but one of the people I've been talking about

244
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,340
 because I went to a very big meeting on this exact subject yesterday with Smoughs.

245
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,540
 So just to know that the British term for Smoughs is con runners which is an unimaginative

246
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,020
 but descriptive word.

247
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,500
 One of the things I did discuss is I spent some time talking to Stephen Silver about the

248
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,420
 plazities got for running social spaces at the Nebula weekend and I think we should very

249
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,980
 much watch that and see how that works because I think that'll be a very interesting lesson

250
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,740
 for the community about what works.

251
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,780
 I will say that the Nebula conference apparently is $150 so maybe £150 is the right price

252
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
 point for these things.

253
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,460
 Maybe that's just how much it costs.

254
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,780
 I didn't realise that.

255
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,820
 I'm still excited about Cozziella and I think we're at that difficult point where we know

256
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,300
 that it's going to be strange but we don't know all the ways it's going to be good yet.

257
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:09,700
 If you were already planning to go to Conzeland, this will, instead of looking like a very expensive

258
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,540
 thing to those obviously weren't planning to go, will look like a bargain way of being

259
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,540
 able to maintain your plans in light of everything that's happening.

260
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,580
 I think there are also a lot of Americans who always go to the Worldcon but could not

261
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,740
 manage the costs for Conzeland particularly having been to Ireland last year and those

262
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:36,180
 people will now for $200 be able to get as much of their Worldcon experience as is available

263
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,180
 this year.

264
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,180
 Yes.

265
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:44,340
 My last thoughts on pricing are one that we don't know how much money Conzeland basically

266
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,260
 has already spent and cannot recoup so we don't know how much of the money they've

267
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:56,940
 already taken in is basically lost on preparation and payments for the physical spaces that

268
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,500
 they then can't use.

269
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,420
 I will say the other point though is that a virtual Worldcon could be a really good

270
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,580
 opportunity to bring in new members who actually never get to go to a Worldcon in person because

271
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,180
 they live in places where there are never Worldcons and maybe giving them the virtual

272
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,700
 experience.

273
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,540
 They might then consider coming to a Worldcon because they've managed to get a taste of

274
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:25,460
 the experience and enjoyed it but I think 150 pounds is going to be too much for the

275
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,340
 people who might join on a whim.

276
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,300
 So I wonder if they might consider having a sort of first Worldcon membership for this

277
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,740
 streaming membership.

278
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,500
 That touches on something that you mentioned in a previous episode which was you pointed

279
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,700
 out when I was talking about professional conferences that virtually attending a professional

280
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,700
 conference is a very good way of lowering barriers to entry to less wealthy people generally.

281
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,460
 I think that is actually a really good thing to bear in mind is that this could be a huge

282
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:02,620
 leveler and that as three relatively wealthy middle class white British people we perhaps

283
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:08,500
 are not the people who can't go to Worldcon because of various circumstances.

284
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,300
 I don't want to go into passive details about my finances but if I decide to go to a Worldcon

285
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,780
 I can save up and I can go to a Worldcon that's fine.

286
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,260
 But there are so many people for whom that is a statement that sounds insane but I sometimes

287
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,860
 forget parts of my privilege and I am always very grateful when other people remind me

288
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,580
 of those parts before I make a giant fool of myself.

289
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:35,220
 I think I'm something like in the 95th percentile on world income scales or maybe a bit higher

290
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,780
 and I could not possibly have imagined ever going to the New Zealand Worldcon on my own

291
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,780
 time.

292
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:48,700
 So yes we could theoretically save up and do it but you know not not ad eat.

293
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,820
 I considered it but I am basically halfway there already and that's the way it would

294
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,820
 be feasible.

295
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,180
 So for me it's like considering a trip to Europe except a bit more expensive because

296
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,780
 New Zealand is harder to get to but that kind of thing.

297
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,220
 I am in a similar situation where the reason I did not want to go to New Zealand was because

298
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,420
 I couldn't afford it but part of that was because I was planning to go to Disney World

299
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,540
 so it's not really a sob story in any meaningful sense.

300
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,660
 Except you didn't get to go to Disney World either.

301
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,780
 No this is this is now that is a sob story.

302
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,460
 I'm not going to get my lightsaber Alison my lightsaber.

303
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,460
 I knew it was a life saver I was getting because if you play sorry huge digression if

304
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,180
 you play Jedi Fallen Order they used the same lightsaber parts as you get in Galaxy Edge

305
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,860
 so I had built the lightsaber I was going to buy in Galaxy's Edge in Fallen Order and

306
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,380
 I knew which crystals I was going to have and I was so excited and now yeah.

307
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,340
 Done there is a potential silver lining to this which is that I am also not going to

308
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,380
 Disney World this year so maybe we could go to Disney World at some point in the future

309
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,900
 at the same time.

310
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,620
 The listeners cannot see the excited head motions I am making but you can see you know

311
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,940
 how excited I am.

312
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,700
 So the last thing I want to ask you about New Zealand is as far as I know Conzeland haven't

313
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,740
 yet announced what time zone they're planning to run their program in.

314
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,180
 We've speculated previously that they would probably pick a time zone that would favour

315
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:16,180
 New Zealanders and US fans but do either of you have any thoughts about what makes sense

316
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,340
 in that regard and have any of you heard anything about what they might be planning

317
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
 to do?

318
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,100
 I have not heard anything about what they might be planning to do.

319
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:30,140
 I think it makes sense to prioritise New Zealanders first and then what time zone will

320
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,180
 allow the maximum number of your members to attend.

321
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,820
 I resigned to this as it means I would probably be able to attend really weirdly timed things

322
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,540
 like possibly parties at 7am my time and the hugos at lunch time or something like that

323
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,180
 but that's just going to happen.

324
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,180
 My understanding is that we should be getting an announcement on this quite soon.

325
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,300
 There's been obviously as you can imagine quite a lot of thinking and working around

326
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,740
 the issue but I understand that that's coming to a conclusion and you should expect to be

327
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,820
 resolved and they're going to try and make a decision that works the best for Conzeland

328
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
 and for their members.

329
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,580
 So I think we're still expecting a lot of announcements for New Zealand and there's

330
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,060
 a lot of work going on to work out exactly what these will be but I think things are

331
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,020
 happening and I think fairly soon the white smoke will go up.

332
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,580
 You expect the water to go up?

333
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,460
 We're electing a new Pope of all World Conz.

334
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
 Yeah hey.

335
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,460
 Space Pope.

336
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,900
 I've had for Vince Dockety.

337
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,300
 Vince would pull off the robes.

338
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,820
 But I mean we're obviously not world conch-airs because you know there are some things that

339
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,300
 you don't do if you've got any sense at all.

340
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,740
 Because you and Liz haven't had time to do that yet and I'm not stupid enough.

341
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,780
 No no no seriously I wasn't about to say you and Liz probably still have that as a plan

342
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,780
 but I'm not stupid enough.

343
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,220
 Imagine a world conch-aired by me and John.

344
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,420
 I'm imagining it's so hard Liz.

345
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,900
 I will not even imagine it.

346
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,060
 I will give you £10 to pre-support it right now.

347
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,060
 Oh man.

348
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,460
 All you need to do is pick a year.

349
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:04,140
 I'm going to go for a 2150 on the basis that if I am still alive I'll presumably be wise

350
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,700
 enough to do it by then.

351
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,180
 You'll be in a vat.

352
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,300
 Liz ever going to chair a world con?

353
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
 No.

354
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,780
 She did not deny as fast as either of us did.

355
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:20,500
 I thought that there might be like I can see coming back to this in like 25 years or

356
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,820
 something when I do chair a world con and someone digs this sound by and goes ha ha

357
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,220
 so I thought should I hedge a bit but then I'm like no I'm not going to chair a world

358
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,700
 con I'm going to say no.

359
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,940
 I would strongly recommend not bothering about that because if you did chair a world con

360
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,940
 you go yeah well people change and if you don't deny it very firmly all the time then

361
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,740
 you will find yourself chairing a world con that is how it works.

362
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,060
 I think we are following and actually we have sufficient people who want to chair world

363
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:55,220
 cons right now and I also think chairing a world con is maybe a full time job at this

364
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,980
 point and I already have a full time job and of course my part time podcasting hobby.

365
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,580
 That's exactly it.

366
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,620
 We do have a circuit of people who want to chair a world con and rather to few who want

367
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,860
 to do all the work.

368
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
 Yes.

369
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,020
 I'd love to chair a world con if someone else would do all the work.

370
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,500
 You heard it here first.

371
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,900
 On the subject of time zones Alison you have an itinerary for your guff trip.

372
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,940
 Do you want to talk to us about that?

373
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
 I do.

374
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,340
 I was originally planning to not fly directly.

375
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:34,140
 I'm going to do the entire experience virtually and I think I might have trailed this last

376
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,060
 time but I hadn't really set any of it up when we were talking before.

377
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,780
 So now I have a Facebook group it's called something like Alice in the Scots virtual guff

378
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,900
 trip that will probably find it for you.

379
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,100
 If you are interested you can join and help me plan it.

380
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,980
 If you're not on Facebook then get in touch and I will send you the stuff and you could

381
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,140
 also give me your thoughts.

382
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,900
 I'm particularly interested in people in Australia and New Zealand.

383
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,300
 I am planning to do stopovers.

384
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,380
 I was originally only going to do one on the way back because my logic was that I would

385
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,940
 be flying non- I would be not flying non-stop from Heathrow to Perth as that is now not

386
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,820
 possible but if it were possible that would be how I would be flying.

387
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,900
 Now the west coast of the US people have said well why can't you do a stopover on the west

388
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,420
 coast of the US and I'm hoping to organise a stopover in the other direction in either

389
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,660
 Shanghai or Japan.

390
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,100
 So it's practically around the world tour at this point.

391
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
 Thailand!

392
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,500
 Stop in Thailand you very rarely get to speak to Liz.

393
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,740
 It's not occurred to me to stop in Thailand and I'd like to say well Pete Young is also

394
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:41,380
 in Thailand but of course Pete Young is actually holed up in Stoke so not in Thailand at all.

395
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,300
 How hot is it where you are Liz?

396
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,460
 It's been in the high 30s.

397
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,260
 Yes, okay so that's one of the nice things about going on a virtual guff trip is that

398
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,860
 it will not be that hot.

399
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,620
 The other nice thing is that because it's going to be summer in the UK and winter in

400
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,260
 New Zealand.

401
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,860
 New Zealand's 11 hours ahead of us rather than 13 hours ahead of us which I think would

402
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,100
 be quite a bit worse in terms of managing it.

403
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,820
 But I am going to go on to Australian, first Australian time and then New Zealand time

404
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
 for three weeks.

405
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,740
 I'm going to get one of the other sort of face masks, the one you wear on a plane that

406
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,020
 covers your eyes so that you can sleep in your very light bedroom in the middle of the

407
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:25,580
 day and go on to the night shift for three weeks and hopefully meet lots of Australian

408
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
 fans.

409
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:35,300
 I'm planning, I've definitely got plans for Perth, Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, Adelaide,

410
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,980
 Hobart, Wellington in all ready.

411
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,420
 So I'm definitely going to go to lots of bits of Australia virtually and see their local

412
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,660
 attractions virtually and hopefully I asked for ideas for cooking the local food and everyone

413
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,460
 comes back with junk food.

414
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:57,940
 I think the only actual plausible recipe that's not either this is an interesting sort of biscuit

415
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:04,300
 that you can probably get hold of or roast kangaroo is chicken parme giana which apparently

416
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,740
 is an Australian specialty.

417
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,940
 So I will have some of that but in the near future I'm going to have the Middlesbrough equivalent

418
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,420
 of chicken parme giana which is called a parmo and it's where you get some chicken, you

419
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:23,660
 flatten it, you breadcrumb it, you whack some Besshamel sauce and some cheddar on it and

420
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,180
 then you put toppings on it like it's a pizza and it comes in a giant box.

421
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,380
 And that is the Middlesbrough equivalent of the Australian delicacy you have just outlined

422
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,300
 and there is a place that delivers them now in Southampton.

423
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,140
 Oh yes, but if you go anywhere in London that does parmose you might be able to get a sort

424
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,820
 of British take on it delivered.

425
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,540
 Authentic one, yeah that sounds really good.

426
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,300
 I mean because delivery food is definitely an option here and in general I'm getting

427
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,780
 Australian wine and beer delivered seems like part of the plan as well.

428
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,580
 So it's coming all nicely and I have quite a lot of people are coming up with some quite

429
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,580
 nice things.

430
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,620
 There's some questions about how we're going to get some famously reclusive Australian

431
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:10,360
 fans to try zoom or discord or some other video conferencing solution of their choice.

432
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,580
 But it's quite interesting because it turns out that my trip, I'm doing three weeks plus

433
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,980
 travel, it's quite full even despite the fact that I'm not going anywhere and it really

434
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:29,340
 brings home how difficult it must be to plan a fan fun trip and not die in the attempt.

435
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,820
 No it is, I remember planning my fan fun trip, I did it when I was in my final year

436
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,660
 of my undergrad degree and I did it very much as an undergraduate as I mentioned on

437
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,860
 Anna's trip report but I think my entire month long trip clocked in at something like 1200

438
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
 pounds.

439
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,300
 I'm going to spend more than that.

440
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,140
 Yeah I should have spent more than that.

441
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,860
 I was going to spend more than that.

442
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,580
 Even virtually.

443
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
 Ha ha!

444
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,780
 No I did it really.

445
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,620
 I took the absolute cheapest flights I possibly could at every juncture and I was bewilderingly

446
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,620
 frugal.

447
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,580
 We should bully Liz into running for guff.

448
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,300
 Liz, rather guff, comes to England from Thailand.

449
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,660
 Is that a good guff trip?

450
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,140
 Ha ha ha!

451
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,260
 I do not think Thailand falls under the remit of guff, John.

452
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,700
 Ha ha ha!

453
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,100
 I'm not sure if I need to send you a map with some scribbles on it to explain where

454
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,980
 countries are but it is not in fact in Australia or New Zealand.

455
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,820
 So I'm torn here because obviously I could just look at a map but equally the notion

456
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,340
 of receiving mail from Thailand that is just Liz annotating maps of the world being like

457
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,220
 Australia, Arrow, not Australia, Arrow.

458
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,340
 That would be, I would not say no Liz.

459
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,460
 That would be a great way for a good year.

460
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,540
 Liz, are you near or further from here than you are from Australia?

461
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:58,060
 I am closer to Australia I believe, I'm about the same distance between the UK and New Zealand.

462
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,060
 I'm not entirely sure on that.

463
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,260
 Yeah, so only really half way.

464
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,500
 Yeah, I am really sort of half way.

465
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,620
 I did look up how long it would take me to go to New Zealand for the Worldcon thinking

466
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,780
 oh, I must be like most of the way there.

467
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,500
 No, it's still a very long trip.

468
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,620
 So I don't want to be too dramatic with fan funds.

469
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,180
 People can run for fan funds if they think they should run for a fan fund.

470
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:28,500
 But I do think there's something nice about having fan fund delegates who have not otherwise

471
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,860
 visited the place or maybe visited the place once a very long time ago for a short while

472
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,380
 and are now getting to do something without the fan funds would not be a practical journey

473
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
 for them.

474
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,140
 I don't want to say it's a requirement or anything like that because it clearly isn't

475
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,140
 and shouldn't be.

476
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,580
 One of the things I think about when voting is how much would I not expect to be able

477
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,060
 to see this person otherwise?

478
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:57,340
 Yes, I don't think John was entirely serious that I should run for a fan fund.

479
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,620
 But I would not consider running for a fan fund unless I was living in one of the places

480
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
 in the fan fund.

481
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,340
 Anyone would like to start a fan fund to just send people to come and visit me?

482
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,820
 That's fine and I will take them out and show them around.

483
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,300
 But I think that's called a holiday fund.

484
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,500
 When I was still enthusiastic and young, me and Claire talked about doing a fan fund

485
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,180
 called OOF which would be the out of the ordinary fan fund for conventions which were

486
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
 not in traditionally served countries.

487
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:31,540
 I don't know if you remember when Chris O'Shea went to Japan, he won jets which was a one

488
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
 off fan fund.

489
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,980
 But I thought it'd be funny to have a fan fund called OOF.

490
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,220
 What was he going to do a trip report?

491
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,700
 No, of course not.

492
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,820
 So we've talked about Alison's guff trip.

493
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,660
 Is there anything else you want to say about it apart from come to Thailand and I'll show

494
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,660
 you around?

495
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:51,180
 Well I think we should when you're visiting Liz on your stopover in Asia on your way back.

496
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,340
 I could stop over everywhere in Asia on my way back from Australia all in the same day

497
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,340
 couldn't I?

498
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:03,860
 Yeah but we should do a live recording of your stopover in this house and we should let

499
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,460
 people ask questions about your trip and that would be fantastic.

500
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,900
 And I'll be in Thai time so when would suit you Liz?

501
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,780
 Well now it's fine it's a thing.

502
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,780
 Oh okay what time is it there?

503
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,380
 Like tea time.

504
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,380
 730.

505
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,580
 Yeah okay so that's what we'll do.

506
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,140
 Well yeah we can.

507
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,980
 Alright we'll do a virtual guff.

508
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,580
 I'm not sure what it won't be Sunday though that's my problem it's going to be mid week

509
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
 so.

510
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,300
 That's fine we will we will cope.

511
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,100
 I'll get it to the diary because I think a live octa thought from Thailand.

512
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:40,340
 Now we discuss staying sane in the apocalypse for a few minutes before we clock off.

513
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,620
 We're expecting some slight lockdown reductions today but I don't think they're going to be

514
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,620
 very specific I think most things are going to be you'll be allowed to go out to exercise

515
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,860
 more than once a day if you're a very enthusiastic jimbani.

516
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,020
 But otherwise it is much of the same we hoped we would have a podcasting studio in our back

517
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,780
 room and that's not work quite as well.

518
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,940
 In fact we found that we're struggling to get internet across our whole house and it

519
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:10,500
 seems to be because our internet provider is struggling to put as much internet as it

520
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:16,060
 is contractually obligated to into the street as everybody in the world uses all of their

521
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:21,900
 internet all the time and this has been getting steadily worse over the period as people have

522
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,980
 managed to train their elderly relatives in using video conferencing and all those years

523
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,340
 that they said people don't need as much upload as they have download that turned out to be

524
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,740
 wrong didn't it boys and girls so but otherwise I'm much less in set because I was quite insane

525
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,500
 last time and I've cheered up quite a bit since then.

526
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
 That's good.

527
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,980
 England is currently having kind of the world's worst outbreak which is strange and not necessarily

528
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,060
 what we expected so that's quite bad that might improve.

529
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:58,740
 I am playing a play by post game of the Arkham horror board game where a man who lives not

530
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,460
 far from me has set up a board in the room with his piano in it and he records YouTube

531
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,260
 videos every night of what happened and then the next day we tell him what we want our

532
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,380
 characters to do and he does it and then he we sent him photographs of the dice that we

533
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,820
 have rolled and then he does another YouTube video explaining what happened and we continue

534
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,620
 on like that which is an incredibly surreal thing that I never would have thought to do

535
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:29,020
 before I wasn't allowed out of my house but it is strangely soothing it is very nice and

536
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:34,180
 relaxing and a wonderful way to play board games so I recommend making friends with someone

537
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:38,300
 who has a board game permanently set up in their house and sends you YouTube videos of

538
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,420
 how it's going this may not be as broadly applicable as previous episodes have been.

539
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:48,420
 Alternatively I can highly recommend playing board games with people on tabletop simulator

540
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,660
 as John and I have been playing board games on tabletop simulator and it is extremely

541
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:57,580
 funny because John has played all the scenarios before and so when we have to make a very

542
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:02,740
 important decision like should we read the neponomicon and keep it submittent knowledge

543
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:08,180
 or should we destroy it I can see John on the video sitting there trying very hard not

544
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:15,500
 to influence us to do the sensible thing you should destroy it and never I mean I think

545
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,700
 I haven't played this game but I'm 99% certain that's the correct answer.

546
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,180
 The correct answer was destroy the nekonomicon and we did destroy the nekonomicon.

547
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:30,460
 The problem is that there are arguments for and against Liz and I know what those arguments

548
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:37,340
 are I know I know what happens if you pick either one I cannot confirm nor deny that you

549
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,060
 picked the right option.

550
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,940
 Which is good for if you want to play it again.

551
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,580
 Alright we are pretty sure that destroying an ekonomicon was the correct thing to do.

552
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,820
 But I am also like allowed to leave the house and things because we're in phase one of

553
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:56,060
 lifting restrictions so I mean we never had I think quite such a strict lockdown as the

554
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:02,140
 UK did but we are sort of back to you can work 50/50 in the office so try and keep the

555
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:07,460
 office 50% empty restaurants are reopening with quite a lot of restrictions on seating

556
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,180
 distances and things like that handful of other things have opened like parks and golf courses

557
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:19,860
 and if all goes well at the end of next week we might go on to the next phase so I may not

558
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,020
 need these coping measures for all that long although I'm still working from home pretty

559
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,020
 much full time.

560
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:30,580
 I've observed that we start off buying a little bit of cheese the amount of cheese we

561
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,220
 would normally buy.

562
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:40,060
 Gradually as the lockdown has extended we've started to buy more and more cheese so each

563
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:45,580
 week a greater proportion of the food we eat is cheese and a greater proportion of the

564
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,700
 meals that we eat are formed of going oh nobody really fancies cooking I'll just eat

565
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,180
 some cheese.

566
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,740
 I have been doing some jigsaw's we still have we have kind of a jigsaw transfer network

567
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:04,020
 round the covid mutual aid group now so all the jigsaw's are getting passed around which

568
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,860
 is good because the street value of jigsaw's is treble in the last two months.

569
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,820
 If you have any mecholism for selling jigsaw's I would recommend that.

570
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:18,260
 I've also noticed as well as my cheese intake going up my beer intake is going up gradually

571
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:26,100
 that as I've worked out more and better ways to socialise online I find I'm doing it more

572
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:31,340
 and therefore I'm it's more effective and therefore I drink more beer.

573
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:36,900
 My daughter said sadly yesterday but there's so much theatre we'd never normally go to

574
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:42,940
 the theatre every week and and yet there are all these theatre things they come on every

575
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:48,700
 week they only last for a few days and so yes lots of theatre lots of highbrow entertainment

576
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,220
 is being provided for our enjoyment.

577
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:57,260
 My part of my staying stay in the apocalypse is that I have bought a new microphone and

578
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:03,020
 the microphone has not appeared I have not been charged for the microphone I don't know

579
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,420
 what I will be charged for the microphone I don't know how to cancel the microphone it's

580
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,300
 all very stressful because I found out that Argos sells this microphone and buying directly

581
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,780
 from the manufacturer might have been worse than buying from Argos which seems backwards

582
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
 to me.

583
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,340
 One of the things that people don't always know is that if Argos has the thing in stock

584
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,660
 and will get it to you they are often the very best option for getting your thing especially

585
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,820
 if it's kind of a small electrical thing because they they just kind of bring it right

586
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,540
 round and you can also they also do click and collect from Sainsbury's so I would click

587
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,340
 and collect from Sainsbury's I think I assume that still works at the moment.

588
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,660
 Yeah it does there has been some discussion about whether it should work.

589
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,260
 There is massive tension at the moment between the people who don't want the economy to

590
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,860
 collapse and the people who don't want everyone to die of the plague.

591
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,900
 You know fair but the people who don't want the economy to collapse are like Argos has

592
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,940
 all these sites in supermarkets which means it got a huge benefit over every other retail

593
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,580
 stop because it had to shut its main retail sites but it could continue to operate its

594
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,780
 entire business through these click and collect sites and says and then the people who wanted

595
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,420
 the economy to survive went well actually that's okay we do not want the economy to

596
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,540
 collapse so letting people making it possible for people to buy manufacturing goods is no

597
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
 bad.

598
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,140
 Yeah I think I'm not going mad but I am ordering a lot online.

599
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,740
 When you do get your microphone from Sainsbury's you will also have to buy your groceries.

600
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,500
 Oh yes sorry I should clarify we have the largest Sainsbury's in my city is a five minute

601
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,180
 walk up the road and so I do my grocery shopping there used to do it all the way back from

602
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,900
 work whenever we needed bits now we'll do it every two weeks in Giganto shops which I

603
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,860
 am still not really used to and the sticker shock of spending two weeks where the groceries

604
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,780
 in one go is still a little bit like what is that really how much spending yes it is

605
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,340
 especially if you call cats.

606
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,740
 You should try having four adults in the house.

607
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,660
 I don't think I should try that Alison.

608
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,020
 I think I think two adults and two cats.

609
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,220
 And a very big hang of cheese.

610
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,300
 On the subject of that we've been drinking much more beer.

611
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,420
 We are ordering six pints a week from the pub across the road.

612
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,420
 Before lockdown we never used to drink that much beer in the pub across the road but now

613
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,420
 we do.

614
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,940
 One of the ways I'm staying sane and the apocalypse is to play board games with members of my

615
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,220
 own household.

616
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,980
 I have been doing that as well.

617
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:32,780
 Because I grew some so that is the upside of having children and then waiting 20 years

618
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,940
 is that you can then play board games with them in lockdown.

619
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:43,500
 I actually logged my 800th board game yesterday or my 800th play yesterday which was a game

620
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,820
 of Arkham Horror of the card game with my lovely wife.

621
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,420
 We got our asses handed to us in the carnival in Venice.

622
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,420
 That was very embarrassing.

623
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,860
 It turns out that I did not have the ability to kill enough cultists and that was a problem.

624
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,060
 But yes I've also been playing a lot of games with this band yet and also watching a lot

625
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,500
 of movies with this band yet.

626
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:04,220
 And also Animal Crossing and I posted a very adorable picture to Facebook of a kitchen.

627
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,940
 We basically designed an entire Animal Crossing kitchen and then we filled it up with turnips

628
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,140
 because one of the features of Animal Crossing is that you end up with a lot of turnips in

629
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,300
 your home.

630
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,580
 And said oh I'm having trouble with my veg box does anyone have any ideas on what you can

631
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,580
 do with turnips.

632
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:25,820
 And one person accurately identified that the answer was sell them for a fat profit on

633
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,540
 Wednesday afternoons.

634
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,860
 And everybody else gave me ideas for using turnips.

635
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:38,300
 In fact they were obviously cartoon turnips on the floor of a cartoon kitchen.

636
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:45,060
 Marianne, my daughter is in her final term at Oxford and had a large not quite thesis

637
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,660
 to hand in.

638
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,020
 And this is obviously been a source of stress in her household and it was due at noon on

639
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,580
 Thursday.

640
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:59,260
 And at 11.52 on Thursday she uploaded it and got the confirmation thing to say.

641
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,020
 It was great and we were like oh that's lovely darling, well done you can relax now.

642
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,740
 And she was like no we only have eight minutes to sell our turnips because there is a stock

643
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,260
 marketed Animal Crossing where you sell turnips at a high price if you don't sell them with

644
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,380
 a week they rot and you have a pile of rotten turnips.

645
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:21,860
 So you use turnip price predictor apps on the internet to tell you how much your turnips

646
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,220
 will sell for.

647
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:28,580
 And so the eight minutes after her getting her essay in for the deadline while we were

648
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:35,700
 trying to get roomfuls of turnips sold before the bell rang at noon was much more stressful

649
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,620
 than any part of the preceding two hours of exactly what format does this need to be

650
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,220
 and how do the citations need to be.

651
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,300
 But the essay has gone in and I made half a million bells selling turnips.

652
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,180
 Yay, excellent.

653
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,700
 So that's probably more than you want to know about Animal Crossing.

654
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,740
 The world's an odd place.

655
00:42:54,740 --> 00:43:00,580
 It's not just me the Financial Times had a long article about Animal Crossing and the

656
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:07,660
 Bank of Animal Crossing and the steps that have been taken to avoid cheats in Animal Crossing

657
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,780
 and the virtual turnip market that I've just described to you.

658
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:18,100
 And it was played not for laughs at all really it basically said it was obviously a funny

659
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,780
 article but it wasn't April Fools because I checked repeatedly they just thought that

660
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:26,980
 it would be funny to have an article about turnip trading at Animal Crossing in the middle

661
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,260
 of the F.T. because people need that sort of thing these days.

662
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,220
 Thanks everyone for listening to the fifth episode of the OctaThought podcast.

663
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,420
 We will see you in a fortnight's time but for now it's goodbye from me.

664
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,060
 And it's goodbye from me.

665
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,340
 And it's goodbye from me.

666
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:46,500
 The music used in this episode was Pamfer for Space by Kevin MacLeod at Incompetech.com

667
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:53,500

668
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:00,900
 Yeah that's a wrap.

669
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,860
 Now of course there is the after show thing so...

670
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,740
 I have spent lots on Arkham Horror.

671
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,340
 I'd be surprised.

672
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,780
 It must be about 700 or 800 pounds.

673
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,460
 Isn't that quite a lot of money?

674
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,460
 That's alright.

675
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,100
 That's why I can't go to New Zealand Alison because I've spent it all on board games.

676
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,700
 No no no no no it's not quite a lot of money for a board game because I was thinking about

677
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,540
 whether we wanted to buy Gloomhaven and it seemed like quite a lot of money for a board

678
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,540
 game.

679
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,540
 Gloomhaven is quite a lot of money.

680
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:38,660
 So my answer is it depends what you think a lot of money is and I don't know whether

681
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,060
 that makes sense.

682
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,220
 How do you manage to spend so Gloomhaven may or may not be value for money.

683
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,220
 So Gloomhaven is almost certainly value...

684
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,340
 The differentiation is between expense and value.

685
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,620
 So Gloomhaven is 120 quid which is quite a lot of money.

686
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,100
 If you buy Gloomhaven you will almost certainly play it for at least 120 hours which means

687
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,940
 it's probably cheaper per hour of entertainment than a book or a movie or a video game.

688
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,300
 Okay so will we is the question?

689
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,340
 Will my family actually get a together to play it?

690
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,380
 That is very much a question for you and your play group.

691
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,380
 So we have some other cooperative games and we were going to go well we're going to play

692
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,460
 some of those and see if we play them enough to make Gloomhaven worthwhile.

693
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,300
 But if Gloomhaven is just majestically better than those.

694
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,020
 I have controversial opinions about Gloomhaven I think it is okay.

695
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,260
 I don't understand why it's the top of the board game geek rankings.

696
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,100
 It just makes no sense at all to me.

697
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,020
 It is a competently done dungeon crawler with a relatively minimal layer of narrative on

698
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,020
 top.

699
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,020
 So that is your bag.

700
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,580
 You'll probably really like it.

701
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,860
 If that is not your bag you might not want.

702
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:46,900
 It is available on Tabletop Simulator in a version which is sanctioned by the designer.

703
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:52,100
 So if you want to know whether it is your cup of tea you could play through the TTS mod.

704
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:57,060
 The only thing I will say is that I personally feel like when you're playing a TTS mod you

705
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,300
 have to bear in mind that it is probably more clunky than playing the actual game because

706
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,660
 well just playing board games on virtualids phases tends to be a little bit less tactile

707
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,660
 and less good.

708
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,700
 But as long as you bear that in mind it is a good way of trying it out.

709
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:17,580
 In terms of Arkham Horror so buying the base set is the equivalent of the way that it works

710
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:23,440
 is that you can buy expansions which are big ish boxes which cost about 25 quid and then

711
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,780
 you can buy smaller packs of cards which are called mythos packs which run you about

712
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,940
 12 quid.

713
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:34,700
 And if you buy one of these big boxes and the six associated small boxes that is a single

714
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,940
 story told over 8 scenarios of a campaign.

715
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:45,140
 So to do that runs you somewhere in the region of 100 pounds to buy like one 8 scenario campaign.

716
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:51,060
 What I will say is that is 100 pounds but so far I have with the one that I spent 100

717
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:55,020
 pounds on which is the first one they did was the Dunich legacy.

718
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,340
 I played that once through with my wife and my friend Michael and playing it once through

719
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:03,500
 with Liz and Hog and Ian and I play it once through my friend Ian.

720
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,420
 So by the time I have gotten my play out of that for the foreseeable future I would

721
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,580
 play through it three times and if you say each game is somewhere in the region of 90

722
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:19,980
 minutes to 2.5 hours that means that I have spent about 60 hours 50 to 60 hours playing

723
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,700
 it which works out about 2000 hours and that doesn't include the fun my friends have had

724
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,700
 with it.

725
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:30,660
 So that is back to this general question about with any investment purchase will you actually

726
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,660
 play it.

727
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,740
 That is the problem we have with the family because although I say we play board games

728
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,580
 with the family we don't actually do that that much we do play a lot of video games

729
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:45,020
 together but we don't play an enormous number of board games although we all like board games

730
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,780
 in degree we should do it more.

731
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,740
 I think if you are trying to get into playing board games I would set yourself like a there

732
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:55,820
 is a thing called a 10 by 10 challenge which is when you play 10 board games 10 times over

733
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,660
 the course of a year and if you have got 10 board games in your collection already that

734
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:05,300
 you like I would I would set yourself one of those and try to get the habit before splashing

735
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,380
 a huge amount of cash on something that's heavily scenario based.

736
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,100
 The other thing I would say is if you're looking for a game to play cooperatively over

737
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:18,100
 a series of sessions it's my impression the pandemic legacy is a bit more accessible than

738
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,060
 Gloomhaven it's certainly half the price the only problem is you only get to play it 12

739
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,060
 to 24 times.

740
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:28,340
 Yeah I'm not playing any game on a pandemic theme this year.

741
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,340
 That's fair.

742
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,340
 Is that not reasonable?

743
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,900
 I mean I know I think that's absolutely reasonable.

744
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,620
 The thing I would say about Arkham is you can buy the base set for the acquit and if

745
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,500
 you hate it you can sell it for 20 quid and then you're 10 quid in the whole and that's

746
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
 not that bad.

747
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,700
 If you buy Gloomhaven you don't like it it's potentially a lot more money that you've

748
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,580
 thrown down a drain.

749
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:52,180
 Yeah though you can buy a reusable sticker pack so one of the options for Gloomhaven

750
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:57,940
 is to buy it and it's reusable sticker pack so you do not in fact mark up your game permanently.

751
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,300
 So I'm not sure how practical that is anyway.

752
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,820
 I'm on hold with the Help Center it's very annoying and I have no Mexican food.

753
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,820
 Who?

754
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:12,740
 Who named three condos in the same area with very similar names?

755
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,740
 Thailand.

756
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,620
 Is that helpful?

757
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:36,620
 Is that what you needed John?

758
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,780
 Yeah I could have added that.

759
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,780
 Something hopefully anyway.
