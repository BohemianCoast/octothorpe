1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
 I was going to say I don't think there are any other podcasts for example on the BSFA

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,560
 best nonfiction long list that we could listen to and it's not a place where I would necessarily

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,800
 expect them to turn up but that's not a place we can look and find new ones.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,600
 I was quite surprised to see a podcast on that list and their mistake.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,240
 I mean I'd have been less surprised if it hadn't been us.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:41,680
 It's fair to say.

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,600
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 51st episode of Octa the Orp, a broadcast for Science

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,320
 Fiction and Science Fiction fandom.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,080
 This episode is coming to you on the 17th of February 2022.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
 I'm John Coxen.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:05,080
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and we have some letters of comment today.

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,240
 We do have a letter of comment.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,120
 It is a letter of comment from Chris Garcia with his congratulations on turning 50.

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,040
 Only the podcast Chris.

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,600
 Only the podcast.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,520
 And he has he has some thoughts on self-promotion.

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,640
 As he says he is seen as a ruthless self-promoter because he did a big Chris for TAF campaign

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,400
 which she says was a lot of fun.

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
 And that's true.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,960
 TAF is definitely a thing for which it is not only allowed to campaign and promote yourself

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,200
 but basically a whole thing of TAF because by promoting yourself for TAF you are just

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,880
 promoting the TAF race and raising funds for TAF and lifting the whole thing up.

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,960
 Yeah when I ran for TAF didn't really promote myself because I was very nervous about whether

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
 that was acceptable.

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
 I very nearly didn't win.

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
 But I did win.

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,440
 I didn't get the most votes but that was fine because I still won.

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,360
 Yeah he also says he tries to self-promote things from the beginning of the year which

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,680
 is interesting on the grounds that if people maybe don't remember as well things they read

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,240
 or watch at the beginning of the year and that he likes to self-promote in the fan categories

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,000
 because of the required number of votes rules and because we are getting a little bit close

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,520
 as we mentioned before to sometimes not having a win in those categories.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,200
 Although I think then you can mostly promote the categories rather than promote specific

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,640
 works in those categories.

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,920
 And he also says side note to Alison that that's not at all how championship boxing works.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,920
 I was slightly surprised at the time that I didn't get any comeback on that and nobody

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,240
 else said and then John used it as the episode title which really I did slightly worry me

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
 but there we go.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,920
 I don't know anything about boxing.

40
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
 Neither do I.

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,960
 Other than I dislike it.

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,280
 It should probably not exist as a competitive sport.

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,680
 We're going to get letters and that's the episode title.

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,000
 Episode 50 to 75 are just going to be a sequence of opinions on championship boxing expressed

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,200
 through episode titles of octa-thop.

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
 You heard it here first folks.

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,160
 Express through the medium of complete ignorance.

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,960
 Yes also true.

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,160
 Chris says people are more likely to vote in a category if they have a horse that is in

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,920
 the race and even if that's just an internet friend who has heard of their zine podcast

51
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,800
 fan writing is not only a vote for that thing but to keep the category being awarded.

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
 And I do.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,680
 I hadn't thought about it in those terms and I agree that a better way to do this is to

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,600
 raise the profile of the category overall and Coribula is doing that among others.

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,680
 But I do see his point that like every vote in a fan category is one vote against that

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,320
 fan category going away.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,320
 I sort of sympathize with that viewpoint a bit.

58
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,520
 I sympathize with that viewpoint a lot.

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,040
 I mean I want everyone who listens to this podcast and who is a member of the member of

60
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,080
 the Chico and Wilcon or last year's Wilcon to get on and nominate especially in the fan

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,680
 categories because I think fan categories are good.

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,600
 And we could do that by telling you some interesting things that you might like to go

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
 and check out.

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,960
 I can't remember what the rules on nominations are for the categories to run because there's

65
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
 a rule on votes.

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,480
 You have to have a certain percentage of votes as a percentage of the number of ballots

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
 coats cast.

68
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,640
 But I don't know is it that you have to have at least five is it like if you've got beneath

69
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,400
 some percentage of the nominations you don't appear on the ballot is there a risk there?

70
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,840
 Quickly to the Westfus Constitution.

71
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,680
 Well no because you said you said about nominating and I know that you did that sort of direct

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,560
 away from self promotion but now it's like well but is there actually a consideration

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,880
 here on nominations or is it just on voting?

74
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,280
 Oh no but I think good nominations invigorate a category because the thing that makes it

75
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,280
 most likely that people won't vote is looking at a category and going I've never heard of

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
 any of these things and why should I care.

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,600
 But I think that will happen in the fan categories a lot anyway and if fans don't self promote

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,720
 their works it's more likely to happen.

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,840
 So I think Chris's point might still stand.

80
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,160
 Are we now an ASMR podcast again?

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,480
 Because we've discussed this in the past John.

82
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,200
 No but genuinely like I think that if no fans talk about their projects then there will

83
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:26,080
 be no fan and so I think Chris is right that self promotion may well be one of the important

84
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,720
 tools to prevent the fan categories going away because most of the Hugo Electric don't

85
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,080
 follow fan works so the only way they're going to is if the fans shout loudly about the fan

86
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,600
 works whereas like authors have like publishers marketing houses behind them so even if the

87
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,560
 author doesn't self promote they have like an entire team of professionals promoting

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,920
 them anyway and we don't.

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,440
 Okay so you thought we were going to get letters about boxing championships?

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,000
 That's nothing compared to the letters we're going to get about the adequacy of publishers

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,960
 marketing effects.

92
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
 Efforts.

93
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,280
 But like you see the point I think.

94
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,920
 I was too busy being stabbed through the heart by the suggestion that the Hugo voting

95
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,520
 community doesn't follow fan works.

96
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,840
 I mean some would say that you're not the obvious pick for the idea list on the podcast

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,160
 but here we are.

98
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,560
 I take your point but I do think that you could achieve it by talking about other fan

99
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,480
 works that you like rather than necessarily your own.

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,120
 So generally we should just talk about fan works more.

101
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,480
 Which we're doing I think?

102
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
 Yes.

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,480
 I like to finish on a nice uncontroversial opinion.

104
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,960
 Right I'll let it about that if you dare.

105
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:45,520
 Ali Baker writes to say that she feels extremely icky about self promotion but a problem of

106
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,800
 non promotion is that there is then cultural hegemony in the part of SFNF that is her area

107
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,440
 of interest which is children's and YA literature.

108
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,040
 As far as I remember she says the only books on the load star short list last year were

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,440
 US books and other international children's book awards are very rarely awarded to non-US

110
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
 authors.

111
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,680
 Raising awareness of brilliant UK based SFF authors can only be positive.

112
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,640
 And I think this is another thing that resonated with me because if you do have a situation

113
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,480
 in which all the American fan creators and professional creators feel able to talk about

114
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,120
 how great they are and none of the Brits do that that will lead to some biases in what

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,840
 actually ends up on the ballot.

116
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,400
 I think it's a good point and I hadn't really thought about it.

117
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,800
 So yes thank you Ali that was food for thought.

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,440
 Historically British fan works only got Hugo's in years when the Worldcon was in Britain

119
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,600
 on average.

120
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,560
 We got a very long letter of comment from Mark Plummer.

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
 Thank you very much.

122
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,320
 Mark says I've been feeling guilty about ignoring opto thought because he has a relentless linearity

123
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,240
 that means that he feels the need to listen to the podcast in order and I have a public

124
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,400
 service announcement for him and everybody else which is that it is not necessary to

125
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,040
 listen to all 51 episodes of opto thought to get the sense of what's going on.

126
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,320
 You can just jump in where you are and then you can write to us about what we're doing.

127
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
 This is not a...

128
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,680
 I think we have themes but I don't think we have any sequentiality about us really.

129
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,440
 The other two might want to comment here.

130
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,240
 I mean there are certain cases where if you write as a letter based on like episode 37

131
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,600
 we may have already corrected ourselves in episode 38 if we were completely wrong.

132
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,720
 For instance if you are listening to episode 50 you probably shouldn't send us another

133
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,400
 letter about how wrong we are about championship boxing.

134
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,600
 I mean unless you've heard us be wrong about championship boxing earlier in episode 51 in

135
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,760
 which case it's fair game again beeps.

136
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,840
 What's more if you are going to do it you could kind of take a place ball approach to

137
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,840
 it and do it in a way that has absolutely nothing to do with championship boxing just

138
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,280
 telling us about the way in which the laser gun has really affected the way the game went

139
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,760
 and that sort of thing.

140
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,080
 That's just true.

141
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,760
 I think so it's tricky because I think part of the fact that we are a more discursive

142
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,160
 podcast which has contributions from our listeners whom we love doesn't mean that there

143
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,800
 are like some continuing threads.

144
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,200
 We're also topical so you know...

145
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
 Are we?

146
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,680
 A lot of stuff we talked about so many episodes are getting might not make any sense.

147
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,080
 We should announce that for those of you not listening on BBC Sounds we will be coming

148
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,520
 out on a four week delay so that our topicality makes no sense to anyone.

149
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,840
 Mark says yes the TAF free ebooks page is a good thing but so are the TAF free ebooks

150
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,040
 that are on that page and for the fan awards you can vote for those that have published

151
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,240
 in 2021 which is good point.

152
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,440
 They can also be voted for for Hugo's as well but I think only in best related work

153
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,200
 where they are not going to make the slightest shadow of an imprint but by all means get

154
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,000
 on and vote for the good ones it's good.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,880
 He also talked about ties in TAF because there was a tie in 1976 and it but in the

156
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,640
 end only one person came.

157
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,000
 I think the precedent seems to be send both people if TAF can afford it.

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,520
 So there was a plan to basically buy a flight that would have enabled both Roy Tacket and

159
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,640
 Bill Bowers to come but for some reason that flight fell through and in the end only Roy

160
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,360
 Tacket came but like there's no that doesn't really set a precedent and I think Mark is

161
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,920
 right that sending both is best and TAF can afford it at the moment.

162
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,520
 So we're launching the Octa Thorpe campaign for TAF to be a tie.

163
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,280
 If everyone could please coordinate and make TAF a four way tie that would be great.

164
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,680
 Sorry TAF administrators this may not be the messaging you wanted.

165
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,160
 However he also says one of the things about Anders is that Anders for TAF incidentally is

166
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,640
 that while he doesn't necessarily do the high profile jobs he's absolutely the kind

167
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,840
 of the person who just volunteers for stuff.

168
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,880
 If you're at a convention if you need somebody to move boxes or stack chairs and as a

169
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,440
 boxers will immediately pitch in possibly even having done the job before you realize

170
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,080
 you needed somebody to help do it.

171
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,960
 He in pubs he habitually collects up to empty classes from around the pub and takes them

172
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,160
 back for the bar.

173
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,600
 Anders for TAF says Mark something which I but not necessarily my co-host hardly a door

174
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,720
 and I'll also say something else on TAF which is if you are thinking voting for somebody

175
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,080
 else first consider putting out a second because it is a properly organized vote and of course

176
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,080
 we'll go for the four way tie which will be very funny and then on self promotion Mark

177
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:30,400
 also raises this distinction between self promotion and signal boosting all of the other

178
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,080
 good stuff that is out there and that is the stuff that really sways his thoughts is when

179
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,560
 the people that whose opinions he trusts recommend things.

180
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,720
 So don't self promote get your mates to promote you instead.

181
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,560
 But when I did that on twitter you got really annoyed at me Alice so I'm just saying that

182
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,840
 I'm getting mixed messages.

183
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,760
 Mark says a couple of things I'd like to pick up on on self promotion which is that he does

184
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,560
 say he doesn't see a self promotion to tell people that a new episode of your podcast exists

185
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,960
 which is something I mentioned because we kind of wanted to draw.

186
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,520
 I wasn't necessarily saying I thought of that self promotion but like I think we wanted

187
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,960
 to distinguish between oh hey I did a new thing and I'd like people to know about it

188
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,480
 versus oh hey I did a thing and I think you should nominate me for the most prestigious

189
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,040
 award in my field which I do think like different concepts that we wanted to make sure we differentiate

190
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,440
 between.

191
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,720
 But he does say it does seem odd to him that I have to set reminders for myself to do

192
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,800
 it but he guesses different people functionally in different ways and yeah I just I don't

193
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,120
 know I just I get to the end and I put it up and I'm like aha I've finished this project

194
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,040
 but my my work has gone into the world and for me the process of telling people that

195
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,600
 has happened doesn't trigger any of the endorphins I get from finishing the project so like I

196
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,000
 do need the reminder to be like no you there's a little bit more work you have to do now

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,200
 which is very kind of ad mini.

198
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,800
 So two things here the first is that this might be slightly on topic but I learned that

199
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,160
 just a few days ago that one of the key difference between people who are seen as organized and

200
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,800
 have their shit together and me is that people in the former group actually conceive of a

201
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,720
 project slightly differently so that they think of a project being done at the point

202
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,720
 at which you know the dishes have been put away in the cupboard and the and the podcast

203
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,480
 has been promoted and the the full set of things have been done and the people who are

204
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,400
 seen as scatty and disorganized stop their projects bang at the point where where the

205
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,200
 exciting bit is done and don't actually do those last little tidying up bits without

206
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,320
 help that was my first point and the second point was I believe that the range of things

207
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,320
 for which John sets reminders for him to do is quite large by the standards of normal

208
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,920
 human beings.

209
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,440
 So on your first point one of the questions they ask you when you get screened for ADHD

210
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,080
 is do you have trouble doing all of the tedious little bits at the end of projects and I said

211
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,960
 of course I do everyone does who wouldn't and this lock is a very good example of how

212
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,160
 that is actually one of the big signs that you might have ADHD.

213
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,080
 Who knew?

214
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,960
 Mark says wouldn't it be nice if best series was voted on once the series was actually

215
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,440
 complete which is very close to my own views and because of course the Expanse won the

216
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,840
 best series Hugo before it was finished.

217
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,720
 Yeah, my problem with best series is that I would like to give the award once the series

218
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
 was done.

219
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,200
 I don't think that.

220
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,280
 And I don't think you could but I take the point absolutely that you don't know when

221
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,880
 the series is done because if the series is successful they just do a bit more of it.

222
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,200
 See also American TV shows.

223
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,160
 See also Sherlock Holmes.

224
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,240
 See also Hawkerseye.

225
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,320
 Let's not blame America for this like Victorian England ruined series for everyone.

226
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,360
 How many views of Mapfugee are there in Hawkerseye's 36 views of Mapfugee?

227
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,240
 Jerry Sullivan, TAF administrator extraordinaire.

228
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,320
 Much as she is entertained by John's vision of breaking a tight TAF race with a football

229
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
 match in the gardens of the Hill cool and Metropole in Birmingham.

230
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,840
 The only thing in the administrators FAQ, the only allowable exception to the race being

231
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,760
 won by simple majority is in the very rare case of a toid race.

232
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,280
 And so Jerry agrees with Mark.

233
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,480
 That's the best thing to do would be to consult with one's TAF co-administrator and send

234
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
 BUNF.

235
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,680
 Oh, four wait I, four wait I.

236
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,960
 And then Jerry wraps up by saying hey I did it, single subject lock.

237
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,080
 Thanks so much for the entire podcast.

238
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,840
 Thank you very much for your single subject lock.

239
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:45,440
 Jerry it was Grant.

240
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,320
 There are some Eastercon updates this week, which means we are back unfortunately to the

241
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,360
 dreaded topic of COVID.

242
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,360
 Reclamation the 2022 Eastercon have announced the vaccination policy, which is that you

243
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
 have to be vaccinated and they have announced this well in advance.

244
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,760
 So if you are not vaccinated thinking of coming to the convention, you can go and get vaccinated.

245
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,080
 They've also opened hotel bookings now.

246
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,840
 So obviously they're planning for an in-person convention and you can now book your hotel

247
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,960
 and it's all starting to look very much like there might be an in-person Eastercon in 2022.

248
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,080
 And so I am then very much thinking, oh should I go to Eastercon in 2022?

249
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,600
 Yes, you should.

250
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 Yes please.

251
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
 We're going to drink beer.

252
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,120
 There is a slight concern which is that while the UK may be in the process of deciding that

253
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,280
 COVID is no longer a thing and so we can just sort of pretend it's not really a thing and

254
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,360
 no one will have to wear masks to take any precautions or self-isolate.

255
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,080
 I live in a place where you are still required to self-isolate if you have COVID and also

256
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,560
 crucially you cannot re-enter the country if you do have COVID and have to currently take

257
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,320
 two tests in a week you arrive to check that you have not developed COVID shortly after

258
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
 arriving.

259
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,680
 So my slight concern is that I would go to Eastercon, potentially get COVID, not because

260
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,400
 I think anyone at Eastercon will not be trying to be as good as possible to prevent COVID,

261
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,720
 but just because this is something that is likely to happen at a large multi-hundred

262
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,560
 person event, especially if it involves going through crowded hotels and restaurants where

263
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,920
 not everyone is from the convention and not everyone wears masks or is vaccinated.

264
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,800
 So in the slight way that I would do that then get a positive test and not be able to

265
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,720
 actually go home for a couple of weeks.

266
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
 So it's tricky.

267
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,440
 I mean I also don't want COVID, but you know there's an extra, extra bonus problem if I

268
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
 do.

269
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,720
 And I do wonder whether that will feature in the thoughts of some other overseas visitors

270
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
 to Eastercon.

271
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,240
 Kind of people who usually go to Eastercon.

272
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,360
 It would be interesting to hear if you write in and let us know what your thoughts are

273
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,480
 on attending Eastercon from overseas, because that could be I think quite illuminating.

274
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,200
 I will be going because I don't have to fly to Toyland afterwards, so I just have to go

275
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
 to Newcastle.

276
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
 So that's a lot easier.

277
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,800
 So I will be going to Eastercon because you know, wild horses wouldn't stop me really.

278
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,320
 What is life for if not to actually attend Eastercons in person?

279
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,280
 I might be wearing my masks all the time like a good person.

280
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,840
 And we don't know what the Eastercon masking plans are yet.

281
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,560
 I don't think they need to make a decision yet about that.

282
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,520
 I think that's something you might want to make a decision about a little near the time.

283
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,400
 But I'm seeing lots of people having kind of thinking out loud on this, not from overseas,

284
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,840
 but just from the normal Eastercon community who are attending members, but are kind of

285
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,880
 going, I don't know whether I'm ready to go to an Eastercon or not.

286
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,720
 So we can clearly have a bunch of people who will go at all costs.

287
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
 And we have probably some people who definitely won't go.

288
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,560
 And I think we've still got a lot of people who are quite in the middle going.

289
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:56,360
 I'm not quite sure how my personal risk profile and the Eastercon match.

290
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,800
 And I think there's still quite a lot of falling out to do there.

291
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,160
 And as a result of all of that, Eastercon has had somewhat fewer of its regular volunteers

292
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,120
 sign up than usual.

293
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,000
 So if you're somebody who thinks you might have fun volunteering at an Eastercon, and

294
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,320
 that means all of you, because volunteering at an Eastercon is the best fun.

295
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,120
 And I know that I'm not doing it this year, but I'm really sorry Phil.

296
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,560
 I'm quite busy with all the things.

297
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,360
 I'm going to be very, very busy working all weekend at Eastercon, but I'm not necessarily

298
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,600
 working for this Eastercon doing it because I'm on the committee, on one of the committees

299
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,160
 bidding for next year's Eastercon.

300
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,800
 And I'm also looking off the fan fun stuff.

301
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,440
 And I'm also touting my, yeah, coming by badges and enamel pins from me.

302
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,240
 That's self-emotion, right?

303
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
 Yeah.

304
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:51,560
 So, yeah, if you'd not sure where you'd like to work, then I think lots of us can make

305
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
 recommendations.

306
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,640
 But I would say that the newsletter is a great place to hang out.

307
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,240
 Not quite sure who newsletter head is.

308
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,600
 I think a lot of my pals will be working on newsletter as usual.

309
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 [Music]

310
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,040
 [Music]

311
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,120
 Olga Thorpe podcast corner.

312
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,560
 I have been listening to podcasts.

313
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,200
 I am going to talk about two podcasts here.

314
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,040
 So one of them is not eligible for Best Fan Cast, but I think people should listen to it anyway,

315
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,880
 and the other one would be eligible for Best Fan Cast should you wish to nominate it.

316
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,760
 So, the first one is a podcast called The Incompraable Game Show.

317
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,760
 So there is a podcast network called The Incompraable, which is run by someone I know

318
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,240
 through Apple journalism circles and started listening to a while back and has lots of

319
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
 different shows on.

320
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,680
 I'm not going to talk about them all, but what I am going to talk about is The Game Show.

321
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:53,280
 So if you are a fan of panel games and if you are a fan of science fiction, you may enjoy

322
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,400
 The Incompraable Game Show because it is mostly panel games about science fiction,

323
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,200
 and it is very good.

324
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,640
 My favorite is one called Inconceivable, which is hosted by Dan Morrin, who is also an author

325
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,960
 and is just amazing.

326
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
 Really enjoy it.

327
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,720
 It's not eligible for Best Fan Cast because they make too much money or a company.

328
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
 I can't remember.

329
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
 This is something complicated.

330
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,080
 Yeah, this is just demonstrating the problem with Fan vs Pro that we will talk about sometime

331
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,040
 because it is obviously professional work.

332
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,200
 If we are talking about The Incompraable, though, can I suggest that The Incompraable

333
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,400
 600, Episode 600, is it would be a very good place to start with The Incompraable, not the

334
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,440
 Game Show, the regular podcast, on account of how it is just seven people talking about

335
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
 all the books they like for an hour.

336
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,040
 And I took lots of notes because many of the books that were recommended were ones that

337
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,840
 I like very much.

338
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,880
 And so I'm rather assuming that quite a lot of the other books will be as well.

339
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
 Yes.

340
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,560
 Although I warn any people who don't like Becky Chambers, that two of the first round picks

341
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,920
 will make your eyes roll.

342
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,640
 Yeah, but for anyone who does like Joe Walton, there are two Joe Walton books recommended

343
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,160
 on that podcast and several people went, "Oh, you've taken my pick."

344
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,520
 I think it's a good episode.

345
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,840
 I would recommend that one.

346
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,120
 And then the one I'm going to recommend, which is a fan cast, is a podcast called Become

347
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,920
 the Tea Pot.

348
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,360
 Now this is a podcast by Ian and Ian, my friend Ian and his friend Ian.

349
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,880
 And basically my friend Ian has read lots of comics and his friend Ian hasn't.

350
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,120
 And so they are on a mission where Ian basically recommends films that have been based on comics

351
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,240
 and then they read the comic and they watch the film and they discuss them.

352
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
 It's really interesting.

353
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,480
 It's a really good concept for a show.

354
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,800
 They've just wrapped up their second X month.

355
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,840
 So both January's, they've been recording, they've done X month and this month was Rhiannuary,

356
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,480
 where they watched only X-Men films starring Ryan Reynolds.

357
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,760
 And that was very good.

358
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,400
 And yeah, no, it's just really interesting to hear the perspective of someone who's super

359
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,840
 into comics, talk about these movies and the perspective of someone who's coming to the

360
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,680
 comics in the opposite direction, experiencing them for the first time.

361
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,880
 Yeah, they do some quite out there ones that I haven't heard of.

362
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,480
 Also some that I'm very familiar with.

363
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,200
 So Ian really didn't like the old guard, which I've always been a bit of a shame because

364
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,480
 I really liked the old guard.

365
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,840
 But he makes good points.

366
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,600
 I just mostly disagree with him.

367
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,520
 And the episode on the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is bloody brilliant.

368
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,840
 They get so grumpy, it's great.

369
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,120
 Might listen to that first.

370
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,400
 It's also fortnightly and it's also only about 45 minutes.

371
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,400
 So if you are a fan of the sort of format of Octo-Thorp, it will suit you down to the

372
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,920
 ground.

373
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:47,960
 And then shall we talk about Best Games Hugo?

374
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,080
 Best Games Hugo went off and spent some time with the Hugo Awards Study Committee in that

375
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,360
 kind of nourishing way that it does.

376
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,040
 And it got, I think, quite a good following win there.

377
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,040
 I think the Study Committee is minded to be quite enthusiastic and the Study Committee

378
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,200
 is, as we know, packed with people who are actually attending business meetings.

379
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,440
 So the next stage is for the draft proposal.

380
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,400
 The draft proposal is out there on the internet and we are going to link to the tweet, which

381
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,200
 includes the proposal itself and also a FAQ.

382
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,600
 And it is now the Best Game Hugo.

383
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,680
 It's been a bit of time being the best video game Hugo.

384
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,440
 And of course the test Hugo was video game.

385
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,160
 I think we've talked about this quite a lot on Octo-Thorp before.

386
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,720
 So we were basically in favour of it being Best Game and quite a lot of other people took

387
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,160
 the same view and so it is currently Best Game.

388
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:43,200
 It's going to go back to for its first round at Chai-Kon and then its second round.

389
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,160
 And then if it gets through that then ratification at Chang-Doo so we will see.

390
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:54,560
 So the proposal that will probably come out of the Hugo Awards Study Committee is a modification

391
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:03,080
 to the Constitution of the WUSFS which basically introduces something at 3.2.5 to define what

392
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,680
 an interactive work is and then introduces a new award at 3.3.10 called Best Game or Interactive

393
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,920
 Work.

394
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,320
 So very exciting if like me you want that to be a Best Game Hugo.

395
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,120
 And when I say I think it's getting a following wind from the Hugo Awards Study Committee,

396
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,520
 I think it's getting a following wind to the extent that it will be the single clear recommendation

397
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,800
 for a new Hugo category coming out of the study committee this year, Touchwood, whereas everything

398
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,960
 else is kind of hanging around in the soup for another time.

399
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,640
 Is that your perception John?

400
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,720
 The Study Committee is mindful of not swamping the business meeting with lots of tweaks

401
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,360
 to categories so I suspect it will be this and one other and then the rest will be kind

402
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,440
 of reported back on for vague comment by interested parties before percolating for another year

403
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,080
 as Alison says.

404
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,200
 I'm very happy with this both because I strongly support the games Hugo especially because

405
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,240
 I think Best Video Game at DC went very well and I will be glad to see that award continue.

406
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,400
 I am also glad that it's being expanded to include things that are not video games because

407
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:20,800
 most of my gaming is not primarily in video form but that is it does lead me to often

408
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:28,680
 a world con will introduce a special category prior to a new category being proposed because

409
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,960
 it's a good way of testing the waters for that category.

410
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,600
 Is this the first time that the category has changed slightly in between the trial category

411
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,880
 and the eventually proposed category?

412
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,920
 Was for SNURDS please write?

413
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,800
 It is a broader category than the one this con ran although I will say given that this

414
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,320
 con's category worked very well with the like type of focus I can't see why it wouldn't

415
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,080
 work with very slightly expanded focus and I suspect even though I will be mostly nominating

416
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:03,160
 tabletop games I suspect the finalists will mostly be video games in much the same way

417
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,920
 that TV dominates best dramatic presentation short form despite the fact that short films

418
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
 are technically eligible.

419
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,880
 I mean I think the better example is that video dominates the best dramatic presentation

420
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,160
 categories despite the fact that audio is technically eligible.

421
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
 Yeah also true.

422
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:26,040
 Because video killed the radio star and if we ever introduce a best audio Hugo prepared

423
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,600
 proposal I want to call it video killed the radio star which would not be the stupidest

424
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,680
 name for a short name for a whisper's proposal ever.

425
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,560
 So I just I've got several comments.

426
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,240
 I went and had a look at the list of special categories which have been awarded by previous

427
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,880
 world cons and I'm not sure any of them have actually become full categories except for

428
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,080
 well I guess it was best all time series which was sort of a precursor to best series but

429
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,720
 I guess was never intended to repeat so you wouldn't bother writing the categories such

430
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
 as it would repeat.

431
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,600
 There's also best new author which I guess turned into the astounding award.

432
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,320
 Oh there was also most promising new author so who knows.

433
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,600
 I think yeah I think I'm generally in favour of expanding the best video game Hugo to be

434
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,240
 best game but I think it does give you a very wide range of stuff to cover and I'm not completely

435
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,000
 convinced it's going to be dominated by video games because when I look at stuff like the

436
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,440
 Nebula award because the Nebula's given award which is called best game writing which they

437
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,880
 give us is 2018 and it is not entirely dominated by video games it also ends up with a lot of

438
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,140
 sort of interactive fiction in there as well and so I think given that we have you know

439
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,120
 venues like Strange Horizons have recently published some more interactive fiction we

440
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,120
 might end up with a mix of that plus video game.

441
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,320
 The other thing is where do you put critical role?

442
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,960
 Dramatic presentation.

443
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,400
 What's critical role?

444
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,360
 I'm asking for the listeners.

445
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,840
 It's an actual play podcast about playing a game.

446
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,080
 It's basically a video where people play D&D and every week you, well not I don't

447
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,000
 know it's D&D or some other thing but it's basically they play RPGs and you watch them

448
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,240
 play their RPG.

449
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
 BDP.

450
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,720
 Yeah it's a dramatic presentation it's definitely not a game.

451
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,760
 What if I nominated it in the best game though?

452
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,160
 Because it's clearly not.

453
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,200
 It would get moved to best presentation unless you had filled your best presentation category

454
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,080
 in which case it would be ignored.

455
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,240
 I don't think, I don't think because an interactive work is a game narrative or presentation in

456
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,440
 which active input or interactive play is an integral component of the work itself.

457
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,200
 So the listener or the viewer has to be able to interact with the work in a way that affects

458
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,880
 the outcome and my understanding is that critical role does not like in the same way

459
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,320
 that Twitch plays Pokemon allow the viewer to actually shape the narrative in any meaningful

460
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,480
 way so it is not eligible in the best game or interactive work category.

461
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,120
 There is an interesting question here about whether or not something like Twitch plays

462
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,960
 Pokemon would be eligible.

463
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,120
 I think yes but I think it is such an edge case it's unlikely to actually be tested and

464
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,560
 ultimately if the community gets behind something like that why not?

465
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,080
 I mean I think it would be interesting to have a fack on that.

466
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,920
 I think the answer there would be to trust the voters and say you know if Twitch plays

467
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,400
 Pokemon got nominated I think if enough people wanted to nominate and vote for it that seems

468
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
 fair to me.

469
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:24,760
 But no critical role isn't there's no question the category explicitly excludes non-interactive

470
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
 work.

471
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,240
 The fact that it's interactive for somebody doesn't mean it's interactive for the Hugo

472
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
 voter.

473
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,520
 Like Curb Your Enthusiasm is improv but that's not an interactive work despite the fact

474
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,160
 that the actors were interacting with one another.

475
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,200
 I mean I think it is I think it's probably an edge case in which I could potentially

476
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,360
 read it to say actually this thing I'm watching is a presentation in which people are doing

477
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,000
 interactive play and therefore it is should count as an interactive work which is being

478
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 filmed.

479
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,440
 So I mean I probably wouldn't nominate anyway but I think it will be interesting to see

480
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
 if anyone does.

481
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,160
 I mean I have a bigger problem with the category that more worries me because I think in the

482
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,120
 way that Hugo voters are perverse which is that I worry that conventions will find their

483
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:17,320
 way in here because the Hugo voters seem to be desperate to have a Hugo for best convention

484
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,600
 thing and you could probably put it in it because what is a convention if not an interactive

485
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,680
 experience but it still doesn't feel like what's made by this and I mean if it goes

486
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,120
 wrong that you know Wisfuss will correct it in due course.

487
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,840
 One and again like no one's nominating conventions for best because I think by the same argument

488
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,560
 you could argue that a convention could technically be eligible for best dramatic presentation

489
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,800
 because you could argue it is a single improvised play.

490
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:53,040
 Yes and they are but they fall way down the list because best dramatic presentation gets

491
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,640
 lots and lots and lots of nominations.

492
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:05,280
 And I think so this category will also get nominations I think which will ensure that

493
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,040
 that does not happen.

494
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:14,400
 It might be worth I guess there might be an argument that says that modifying the subclosies

495
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,160
 to explicitly exclude active plays is wise but I'd want to see it in action for a couple

496
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,280
 of years first because I note that best video game at Discom I don't think anyone nominated

497
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:32,000
 any let's plays of games so I am not minded to think it will be a problem really.

498
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,520
 Because of course we are praying in aid let's plays as an evaluation tool for people who

499
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,760
 cannot actually play the whole of every game themselves.

500
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,760
 Yes.

501
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,080
 So yeah.

502
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,440
 I wasn't intending to provoke such a strong reaction just to me I think it could be read

503
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,560
 as an edge case and I think it will be interesting to see.

504
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,480
 I think we should probably go ahead with it as it is because otherwise we'll just argue

505
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,680
 for another year about definitions of stuff.

506
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,800
 But it will be interesting to see what we end up with and also because it could potentially

507
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,800
 be a weird category in which I'm basically comparing a piece of interactive fiction in

508
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:15,280
 which I can choose my own adventure in two or three places with a complete 100 hour video

509
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
 game.

510
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,840
 Oh sorry you could be choosing it with a complete 100 hour video game where you get

511
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,600
 to choose the direction of playing all three engagements.

512
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,760
 I mean I'm going to be arguing very strongly when this category exists that people should

513
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,040
 be casting their nominations and votes for things where the actions that you take influence

514
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,320
 the game in a big way quite a lot.

515
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,840
 I know that that's only my view and people do like the other sort of thing quite a lot

516
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
 as well.

517
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
 Yes.

518
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:48,880
 I mean from my perspective your criticism there is interesting because although I felt

519
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,840
 Hades is quite linear isn't it?

520
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,480
 It's got ones.

521
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,560
 Like you play and you go through the same thing each time and then things happen and

522
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,760
 really the only agency you have is who you give presents to and which weapon you pick.

523
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,320
 I mean maybe if you play 300 hours this becomes less obviously true but like.

524
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:13,840
 Okay so the thing about Hades is that it it what happens in the game is extremely dependent

525
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,960
 on what choices you make but it is certainly true that by the time you get to 300 hours

526
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,760
 you've then explored playing Hades for 300 hours is like going through the Sonic game

527
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,040
 books till you've explored every single possible strand of it right.

528
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,760
 So eventually you do manage to get all of the branches but Hades got a lot of branches.

529
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,040
 There are a lot of subplots and interesting weird things that happen and that's part

530
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,920
 of what is so good about it.

531
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:47,120
 I felt like I had more minute to minute agency in spirit fairer than I did in Hades which I

532
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,360
 suspect is why I preferred spirit fairer to Hades because I got to make choices about

533
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,000
 what I did next whereas in Hades it was I go through the dungeon again but I take the

534
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,360
 point that like maybe you kind of bounced off Hades didn't you?

535
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,880
 I mean I played it for like five hours but yeah like but I will say going back to what

536
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,560
 Liz said I would like to recommend a sub stack on interactive fiction and I would like to

537
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,320
 quite strongly push back on the idea that a hundred hour video game is somehow inherently

538
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,120
 better than a work of an interactive fiction because I do not think this is true.

539
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,280
 I at no point said that John.

540
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,000
 No you might have to compare the two but I compare the two all the time so you know.

541
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,920
 I'm just saying that they are too like they're quite different.

542
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,120
 Yeah they're very different.

543
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,240
 I do not expect to have to compare you know I do not have to judge this game based on its

544
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,080
 interactiveness right.

545
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,400
 I mean it's a thing for best game it does not say best interactive parts of a game it's

546
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,880
 best game so if I wanted to choose like I don't know street fighter whatever you know

547
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,560
 street fighter two or something then I could and I'm not judging that based on its narrative

548
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,520
 I'm judging it as a game and so I'm saying something like you know.

549
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
 Oh yeah yeah.

550
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:04,240
 I have 10 minute mini interactive twine fiction story judged against like a giant AA video

551
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,600
 game is a very broad set of things to consider and maybe broader than we consider in most

552
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,680
 of the categories and we are now kind of taking those stories out of where you know they now

553
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,760
 can't compete in like short story or novel letter anything which you know.

554
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
 But they weren't anyway.

555
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,800
 Well they weren't being nominated but.

556
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,640
 I take I take the point but that that if you created a category that short films could

557
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,600
 appear in and you were like but now they can't compete in best dramatic presentation short

558
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,280
 form I'd be like I mean that is true but given that they're already not represented

559
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
 there.

560
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,160
 This is the hugos do not have to be completely fine grained.

561
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,080
 Yeah and it just I it just feels weird to me to create categories that compare enormous

562
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,680
 disparate amounts of stuff while we still have kind of all these pretty fine grained

563
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,280
 categories saying we're going to compare you know I think it's easier to compare a short

564
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,560
 story in a novel letter than to compare like a short piece of interactive fiction with Horizon

565
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
 Zero Dawn.

566
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,960
 I don't think we're ever going to get away from extremely fine grained categories of

567
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,680
 written fiction because that's that's where you get started right.

568
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,520
 I don't think we're going to remove any hugo categories.

569
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:14,680
 Yeah so let's just start here and then later people might go but the reason I wanted it

570
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,560
 to be game and not video game which otherwise we'd talk about.

571
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,760
 Yeah I should say I think this is a better way of doing it than best video game I just

572
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,200
 do think it's got certain you know awkwardness is to it.

573
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,600
 Imagine if we had a hugo category with awkwardness as in it.

574
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:36,080
 But I will also say that the Nebula Award because it is specifically for best game rating will

575
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,280
 tend towards that kind of game in a way that I don't think this one will because technically

576
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,200
 speaking the interactive fiction you're describing would have been eligible at this con and looking

577
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,120
 it down the list of nominations we had Ghost of Tsushima, Sense and Semiosis, Ori and the

578
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,480
 Will of the Wisps, Spider-Man Miles Morales, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Cyberpunk 2077,

579
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,040
 the Luminous Underground, Kentucky Route Zero, Half-Life Alyx and Star Wars Squadrons.

580
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,680
 Sense and Semiosis is a 10 minute twangay.

581
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,280
 No I mean I'm not saying there are none but I am saying the category is clearly not being

582
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,960
 dominated by those things so I'm not sure again that that will be a big problem.

583
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:25,400
 The Discon released all their program items online for me to watch.

584
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,560
 So some of the recordings that are available if you go and look for them and you log in

585
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,440
 in your Discon account you will find them but they have not officially released anything

586
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,560
 yet and in the Discord on the 2nd of February they said I know we keep saying soon but we

587
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,880
 do mean it so they're coming real soon now maybe even before we release and then they're

588
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,600
 going to be available for 30 days so as soon as they're available the next time we do the

589
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,000
 podcast we'll tell you but you probably do want to keep checking every couple of weeks

590
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,160
 in case they've turned up.

591
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,360
 This is the age old problem of like once a convention's finished it's very hard to get

592
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,280
 anyone to do anything because a convention's finished.

593
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,680
 Well I will also say like I think the majority of the program is up and I would much rather

594
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,960
 they waited until it was all up and then start the third day clock than saying well we've

595
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,760
 put most of it up and we said it would be 30 days after we announced that so we've

596
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,160
 announced it and now there are 30 days and they just never get around to the rest so

597
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,120
 I do think this is the right way of doing it and like yeah I'm broadly speaking pro

598
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,880
 Discon on this one I'm afraid I'm being very contrary this week.

599
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,840
 No I think it's fine I mean I think it is certainly useful for us to say they're there

600
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,800
 going to go and get them fill your boots.

601
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,520
 Oh yeah because they have an announcement so like if you hadn't realised that there might

602
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,640
 be some programming you want to watch in your Discon account.

603
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,200
 Yeah so if you went to Discon or had a virtual membership of Discon I would like to go see

604
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,780
 their program quite a lot of it is online now but they're still they haven't formally

605
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,600
 announced it and they do keep saying that soon and I think what they've got is a few

606
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,920
 items where they're just tidying off the loose ends before they do that.

607
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,280
 Yes for instance I did not know any of it was there I guess the answer is I probably should

608
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,080
 have asked Alison but that feels like a weird way to find out about it.

609
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,800
 I'm still on the Discon Discord and it was mentioned on the Discord it just wasn't

610
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:21,640
 so I have been carefully not saying for three months two months yeah there's some stuff

611
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,040
 there if you go and look for it because they have not said it in any way publicly but it's

612
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:31,600
 clear that there's a thread in the public questions and answers where it is made clear that is

613
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,600
 there now and as far as I'm concerned that means it's fair game for putting on Octoforp

614
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,480
 it is there they have not announced it but much of it is there.

615
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,000
 Yeah I have not been reading all the Discon Discord channels since Discon finished so

616
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,440
 I missed this but I guess I can now watch some replays.

617
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
 Yes!

618
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:59,680
 So I saw a tweet from Jason Sanford he is running a survey on science fiction fantasy

619
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,880
 magazines to see how readers access them and how that may have changed during the pandemic

620
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,400
 and apparently he has a survey done very close to the start of the pandemic like just before

621
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,440
 so we'll have some interesting data to compare so if anyone wants to go in and fill out his

622
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,440
 survey on how they interact with science fiction fantasy magazines we will put it in the show notes.

623
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,960
 Thank you very much Liz and then shall we do pics?

624
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
 Yeah!

625
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,960
 Who would like to do their pic first?

626
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,020
 So my pic is far from the light of heaven a novel by Tare Thompson which is a it's a stand

627
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:43,200
 loan novel about a colony ship where people are travelling like years to their new colony

628
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,720
 and it's basically a ship controlled by AI but of course it has to have a captain on

629
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,960
 the essentially just kind of just in case and the captain is always told you know you

630
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,960
 won't really need to do anything you're just there just in case and of course what we actually

631
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:07,420
 find out is that she arrives at the planet and everything has gone wrong it's to become

632
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,740
 clear that the AI is not functioning in any way the way it should be and that quite a

633
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,860
 lot of the colonists are missing.

634
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:20,140
 So it's basically a locked room mystery in space because your locked room is the spaceship

635
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,300
 and so she's trying to piece together what has happened during like the journey when

636
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,380
 they've all been in cold sleep and you know investigators come up from the colony planet

637
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:34,740
 she's on and it's just all about the mystery kind of unfolding on this on this ship and

638
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:41,000
 how this also interacts with kind of the political situation of the colony planets so the nearby

639
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,500
 of the space station that is there for the colony ships and I just think it's a pretty

640
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,520
 good stand loan bit of kind of locked room mystery in space.

641
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:57,720
 I think my warm drawback is that I don't actually think the resolution of the mystery is amazing

642
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,120
 and you know when it is kind of a locked room mystery it does sort of you know a key bit

643
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:08,440
 is how it was done and it didn't feel entirely satisfying to me but I thought the journey

644
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,960
 to get there was very interesting.

645
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,280
 So yeah I enjoyed it.

646
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:18,040
 I have not read this it sounds very much like my cup of tea but it does very strongly remind

647
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:26,760
 me of Six Wakes by Merlaffte which was on the Hugo finalist roster in I want to say 2018

648
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,760
 but I might be wrong around then and I adored that was also a locked room mystery set on

649
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,800
 a spaceship and it had the twist that the opening chapter is from the perspective of

650
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,480
 the clone of one of the murder victims waking up with an incomplete memory backup and seeing

651
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,720
 their murdered body and that is how the mystery starts and I adored that novel.

652
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,440
 I thought it was really great and unlike what you've just said I really liked how the mystery

653
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,480
 ended up having been perpetrated.

654
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,840
 I thought it was very good.

655
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,800
 So there are some reviews on Goodreads that say it is you know there are some similarities

656
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,120
 to Six Wakes and some say this is like Six Wakes but not quite as good so it may not

657
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,200
 entirely be your cup of tea but yeah I think I would recommend it that there is enough

658
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,960
 of interest there in the kind of you know the characters and how this kind of colony system

659
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,160
 interacts that I would recommend it.

660
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,000
 It also made me remind me a little bit I think it's is it Jack Glass? Jack Glassby

661
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,800
 Adam Roberts which is one way you know exactly who the murder is but not how he did it until

662
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,840
 later in the book which I also enjoyed.

663
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,840
 Ah the sort of like Colombo.

664
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,880
 This is one of the books that was recommended to me when I asked for recommendations for

665
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,400
 my pals on things that I might want to vote for for the Hugo as a fantastic book of 2021

666
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,120
 and then several other people chipped in to say they'd really enjoyed it as well so it's

667
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:03,080
 on my next stop to read list so I'll probably read it by next time maybe so library book

668
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,840
 it's another one I've got on paper turns out paper has very small print when did they do

669
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,680
 that I'm sure while I was younger it was very easy to read books written on paper and the

670
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,120
 print was plenty bigger now.

671
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,680
 I don't really have a pick this week on account of having spent most of the two weeks reading

672
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,000
 a fat fantasy novel that we're going to talk about next time but I do want to say that I

673
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,560
 have listened I've watched episode one of Loki which is I believe a series in the Marvel

674
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,440
 Cinematic Universe but I enjoyed it hugely and I want to pick it now because I've been

675
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,920
 told by several different people that by the time I get to the end I will not like it

676
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,080
 anymore.

677
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:45,480
 Including John so I mean I basically at the first episode is kind of great because it's

678
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,560
 got Tom Hiddleston doing Loki in the way I've kind of always wanted him to do it which

679
00:45:50,560 --> 00:46:00,080
 is where he is naked is grappling with issues about free will and the fixed state of the

680
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,200
 universe and this is all happening because Marvel it turns out that the reason you've

681
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,680
 only seen one version of the Earth in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is because there's

682
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,400
 a weirdo bunch of time police looking after it and it was all done with an aesthetic which

683
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:22,760
 is kind of brazilish brazilish rather than brazilian but you know and and it's all absolutely

684
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:29,280
 lovely and enormous amounts of the graphic design and cinematography and locations and

685
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,440
 everything are just fantastic and if it carries on as good as this I will be absolutely thrilled

686
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,840
 but I know it won't which is why I'm picking it now.

687
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,680
 I will say the aesthetic stays rock solid throughout like it is an enormously pretty

688
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,280
 show and I enjoyed it a great deal.

689
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,560
 Well Tom Hiddleston is an enormously pretty actor so you know.

690
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,800
 That's fair and I think I will say like there is a chance that you will think it does stick

691
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,520
 the landing I don't know it'll be interesting to see.

692
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,240
 On the subject of MCU shows I did not pick it as a pick on the pod but a really enjoyed

693
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:09,560
 Hawkeye which I think is my favourite of the MCU series and so yes that's the kind of

694
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,720
 the one I loved out of the four of them.

695
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,080
 I think Hawkeye is probably my third favourite.

696
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:20,880
 Might be my least favourite but like it is a relatively high floor so being the least

697
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,440
 favourite doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it.

698
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:30,000
 If you haven't seen the latest Spider-Man movie I'm about to do a casting spoiler so

699
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,520
 you may want to skip to the next chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it.

700
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:43,640
 The Spider-Man film went to see it very good movie and I really enjoyed seeing Tom Holland

701
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:50,720
 and Bennett Cumberbatch doing their thing and Zendaya and the other guy whose name I can't

702
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,560
 remember because he's not as famous as Zendaya and Tom Holland sorry Ned but really enjoyed

703
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:02,440
 the movie and I thought it was a very good wrap up of the first trilogy of Tom Holland

704
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:11,680
 Spider-Man movies and I also thought it was a good capper for Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield

705
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,040
 in their roles in Spider-Man some very good interactions there and I thought it worked

706
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:24,960
 very well and on the subject of Andrew Garfield I also watched Tic-tic Boom which is not genre

707
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:32,240
 except that it does have a sci-fi rock musical in it in the background called Super Berbia

708
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,120
 which I really want to see like now I've seen Tic-tic Boom I absolutely want someone to

709
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,400
 stage that I understand that it would not work commercially at all but like oh my god

710
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,040
 if anyone does that I want to see it because it looks amazing and it is so good I loved

711
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,320
 it I adored it.

712
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,200
 Andrew Garfield is amazing in it I mean I have a huge crush on Garfield anyway but he

713
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:59,760
 is just sublime and I really liked kind of witnessing that kind of slice of history it

714
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,520
 is a desperately poignant film and I really really really loved it and it is on Netflix

715
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,920
 and you put it and you put this on to your letterbox so we all knew how much you liked

716
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,440
 it right yep yeah four and a half stars might have been four car over but I definitely

717
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,280
 reviewed it yesterday okay maybe I maybe I'm not quite caught up so yes Alison I did

718
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:31,700
 boom if my mic wasn't on a stand I would drop it don't don't don't drop every time

719
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:38,680
 anyone drops a mic I get really really really upset are you a big little Miranda fan because

720
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:45,160
 this is a this is a Miranda project I mean I am I am a big limo Miranda fan except that

721
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:50,840
 none of the music is by him it's directed by him and the staging is very good he directed

722
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:55,440
 it but also he made it happen I'm not sure it's actually produced and directed by but

723
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:03,560
 he is it's all it was his idea of a film limo Miranda directed and was one of the producers

724
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,360
 on it but don't go into it thinking it will be limo Miranda songs because it is very much

725
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:15,000
 not it is Jonathan Larson songs and it is amazing no no but it is a passion project by

726
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,360
 Miranda so it was on my list because you know no no if what you want is a nice film with

727
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,840
 Miranda songs you need to go and watch in camto which I think I had as a bick a couple

728
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,640
 of weeks ago but I might not have done and it's got Vanessa Hudgens in who I think is

729
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,800
 underused but yeah right now it's it's going way up my list now I just need to talk Stephen

730
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,720
 and also they do the thing at the end where they like play video that they have of like

731
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,920
 Jonathan Larson so you can see like the matches they got to their kind of locations and characters

732
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,800
 and that was quite fun I do like when they do that and the thing that really blew my

733
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,280
 mind sorry is I looked it up afterwards because I was like oh Andrew Garfield he's very good

734
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:58,640
 in this and he learned to sing and play piano for the movie and I'm like like because I was

735
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,200
 like oh I didn't know he could sing and he couldn't and now he can and he's amazing so

736
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:11,080
 like maybe he'd just never tried maybe I bet I guess but yeah if he gets the oh I think

737
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,960
 he's half of the way to an ego so that's good so will it make me cry John yeah make me cry

738
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,880
 I'm gonna say you should watch Tom Scott's video about basically decides to record himself

739
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,600
 singing and get to singing to help him and a good producer to produce it and he's extremely

740
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,600
 good for someone who is clearly very embarrassed about doing it and feels he has no singing

741
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,360
 ability so I think yeah if Andrew Garfield had any ability they could probably take him

742
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,520
 from zero to really credible pretty quickly and that was the Octa thought podcast and it's

743
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,600
 goodbye from me it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

744
00:51:45,600 --> 00:52:06,760
 [Music]

745
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,040
 Hades did also win the Nebula and that is because you might or might not think it's linear it

746
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:18,840
 has 300,000 words of voice dialogue oh no the the writing is great like I'm not not

747
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,360
 this and the writing is unbelievably good and and a lot of those are in strands that

748
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,800
 you won't see unless you take make particular choices so it's it's it's it's quite like

749
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,920
 interactive fiction book in that way except eventually if you give enough if you give

750
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,720
 enough abrosia and stuff to enough different people you will get all the ending no your

751
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:43,480
 your analogy of the sonic game book I thought was very good because I think I think you are

752
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:48,920
 right that in a lot of ways it's not so much about like the interesting points of the sonic

753
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,360
 game book and not when you're rolling dice to do the combats the choices you made that

754
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:57,240
 got you to the combat and I think that Hades the choices that you make outside of the core

755
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:03,080
 gameplay loop are almost the interesting interactive thing which is an interesting way to do a roguelike

756
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:08,760
 yes but the other way that Hades is extremely innovative is that it it provides a setting

757
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,960
 in which dying and having to start all over again makes perfect sense which I feel like

758
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:19,960
 games have been looking for for a long time but I'm not sure I would have enjoyed Hades as much

759
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,440
 if I couldn't also you know go and smack people up with my big sword yes it's it's beautifully

760
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:32,360
 balanced anyway sorry we're gonna talk about last year's winner now but there's a reason why it

761
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:38,920
 bought over well be Lee no I think that's germane but I think that might be why I have a slightly

762
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,960
 different view on this because the part of Hades I found frustrating was I did not find the combat

763
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,840
 sufficiently compelling to keep me in the narrative and so I suspect that might be where part of

764
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,960
 this is coming from I found I found it made my hand hurt because I was pressing buttons very quickly

765
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,960
 and I don't I just I found the combat a bit too frenetic whereas like a lot of the games I like

766
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:06,840
 were fighting in are a bit more that there is also god mode and I was playing on god mode

767
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:12,840
 eventually but basically like Hades is a game where if you press buttons quicker it goes better

768
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:19,160
 for you yeah a lot of video games I like that John no but like Horizon Zero gone Dawn you don't

769
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:24,600
 press buttons quickly you press buttons at the right time in Jedi Fallen Order you press you press

770
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:29,240
 buttons at the right time and so Hades very much felt like that core gameplay loop was it wasn't

771
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,880
 a game of working out how to use each weapon elegantly it was a game of pressing buttons incredibly

772
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:41,960
 fast and for me I found that was what really turned me off it because I just I don't there are there

773
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,880
 are builds in Hades where you don't need to press any buttons at all as well so one of the reasons

774
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:50,120
 that people like is because there are builds that work for people who cannot press buttons yeah I

775
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:55,880
 think it's this is basically if you play like if you got the point where you play like 20 hours I

776
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,800
 think you would have started to get some of these play styles but you really only unlock these kind

777
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:05,880
 of quite later on I finished it but not done all the epilogues but you know once you've unlocked all

778
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,720
 the weapons and you start to get all the aspects of the weapons you can start to be like okay this

779
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,360
 is a clever way of doing it but now this is my Achilles heel you know you'd have to press the

780
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:20,040
 dash stab button very quickly though it's the old perdido street station got good 500 pages in

781
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:28,840
 argument or indeed Octa sort much better yeah we we only really got good 26 episodes in listeners

782

00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,560

784
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,400
 surprised that we have all these opinions about video games but if you're Mark Plummer listening

786
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,600
 episodes very little game content and then you start listening again and it just it's a curse
