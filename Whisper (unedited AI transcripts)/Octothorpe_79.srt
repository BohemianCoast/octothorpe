00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 79th episode of Octa Thorpe. This episode is coming

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,640
 to you on the 16th of March 2023. I am John Coxon.

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,920
 I am Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. John, are you doing your best presenter voice in a

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,400
 way to be on match the day or something? We stand with Gary Lineker because he's a legend and he's

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,160
 the only match of the day host, whoever sold vegetables on Lester Market. The BBC's announced there's

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,400
 going to be no punditry. I woke up and it was like everyone's saying, I'm not going to do it and

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,880
 then are you right saying, well, I'm not going to do it. And then everyone else followed by saying,

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,520
 well, if you're right, it's not doing it. We won't do it either. In the comment, it's like, well,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
 we won't commentate and I woke up to all this and it was like, yeah, that is an overnight cluster

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,880
 fucking it. Anyway, sorry, off topic. Yup. Did you see that Joe Lysit said I'll do it?

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,600
 Yes. Yeah, I really want Joe Lysit to do it so much. I love them so much.

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,320
 I think they'd be great because I'm also sure that Joe Lysit does not know a whole lot about

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,320
 Premier League football. But he does know a whole lot about being right-wing.

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,720
 He does. Right. Yeah, anyway, we're going to do a podcast. Anyone who's not British is like,

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,040
 what is going on? And we're going to refuse to explain. Sorry, American listeners.

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,480
 Just Google. Oh, no, I can't imagine there's going to be a single sensible roundup of this

17
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,800
 that incorporates everything we just said. We have a letter as a comment. I wanted to come back to

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,720
 a letter of comment from Raj on episode 77 because I didn't say something and then I regretted not

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,520
 saying something, which is that when I had been discussing Ms Marvel and representation,

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
 I'd had conversations with a couple of people who had doubted whether or not Ms Marvel would

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,600
 be good representation for people who were not American, like basically for members of the

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,960
 Pakistani diaspora from around the rest of the world. And Raj did say in his episode 77

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,320
 in luck that he really enjoyed Ms Marvel and he thought it was great for representation.

24
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,600
 And it was nice to see people who looked like me represented in genre fiction in the MCU no less.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,640
 And Raj, to the best of my knowledge, is not a young girl living in New Jersey being as how

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,320
 he is a man who lives in Glasgow. We also heard from other people, Bridget, for instance.

27
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,480
 Yeah, so Bridget came on Cafe Moose, which is my regular weekday zoom thing and said,

28
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,840
 can I give you a lock here on Cafe Moose? And we said, if you must.

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,880
 We said, yes, that would be lovely. We did not grumble. John said, yes, that would be lovely.

30
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,160
 And I said, oh, I'm not sure I'll remember it. But luckily John wrote it down. So there we go.

31
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,440
 And Bridget said, fandom has great policies for things, but individual people in fandom can be

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,440
 obstreperous and obstrative. And this is very true. This is why we have great policies, honestly.

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
 Strew in a lot of places, to be honest.

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,960
 Yeah, it is not just fandom, but it is definitely true of fandom.

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,600
 Oh, I think that's a particular streak of stubborn in fandom. You might be right.

36
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,320
 We also heard from Christopher J Garcia, who's a legend like Gary Linnaker.

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,920
 I've answered several of our queries about sentences which he left halfway through in the

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,440
 last legend comment. Yep. And so he recommends a single best thing he watched last year,

39
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,440
 a film called Big Book, which is, according to the internet, a French science fiction black

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,240
 comedy film that you can watch on Netflix. So,

41
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,720
 that sounds like a good shout, actually. So it might be worth watching. I certainly have not

42
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,280
 watched any recent French black comedy science fiction films. So I might give that a go.

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,600
 It was Chris who showed me OSS Sandy Set for the first time, which is a delightful and ridiculous

44
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,160
 French movie, which I did wholly enjoy. It was not Chris that showed me Breece. And honestly,

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,880
 Chris, I will never forgive you because Breece is the best movie in the world. And the only reason I

46
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,400
 want the world con to be a niece. Breece is the word. And if anyone is listening who hasn't seen

47
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,960
 Breece, you should go see it because it's very good and extremely silly. Do we want to get into

48
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,840
 Chris's comment on the pronunciation of a particular word, which I think is now a running

49
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,920
 top view conversation for three whole episodes? Yes. So. Chris's on team, a mock rhymes with a lock.

50
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,480
 It's pronounced a mock if it follows the same pronunciation as a mock time,

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,080
 which I heard Theodore Sturgeon called a mock time in the before four times back when he was alive.

52
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,440
 I'm not sure if his ghost says it the same. On the other hand, you pronounce Spock, Spock.

53
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,160
 So thanks, Chris. That is valuable input to the debate, as always.

54
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,640
 Yeah. I mean, I think pulling out the I heard Theodore Sturgeon say it card is a powerful argument

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,600
 that Chris, thank you. It conflicts with Laurie from Hugo Girl saying that she pronounces it a

56
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,560
 muck, but she fails to note which legend of the science fiction genre taught her this pronunciation.

57
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,800
 So can we really trust her? Yeah, Laurie, if it turns out that you learned the pronunciation from

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:29,200
 like Ursula Le Guin, then. Well, I now want to do next time we're at the Glasgow World con,

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,640
 is every time one of us bumps into a famous author, we just record on our phone how they say the word.

60
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,040
 We have it on a little sign and we say, please read this word out and we record it.

61
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,880
 And then we play them all on a future episode of Octa Thorpe and we have ribbons.

62
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,960
 This would certainly be the best use of Octa Thorpe's time interviewing famous authors that are welcome.

63
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,160
 Yup. I might do it to Adrian Tchaikovsky at Eastcom and see whether he's confused.

64
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
 We could ask them about a few different words while we're at it.

65
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
 Could we? What else do we disagree on?

66
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
 Muffie!

67
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,760
 Muffie!

68
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,520
 [laughs]

69
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,720
 Thank you to Kurt Phillips who once saw me eat a cheeseburger.

70
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,320
 I don't know whether we want to unpack that or not.

71
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
 Well, we're just gonna leave it there.

72
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,120
 I think so. I also like that Kurt says, I find that I agree with most everything you all said.

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,240
 Thank you, Kurt.

74
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
 Hey.

75
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,280
 On the subject of agreeing, he says, he assumes over the next episode or two of Octa Thorpe

76
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,120
 will start making Hugo World suggestions and that will surely give him something to disagree with.

77
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
 He says, I'm sure you'll do your best for me.

78
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,920
 And yes, we will attempt to be opinionated.

79
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,120
 Obviously, we're usually very diplomatic and unopinionated, so it is hard, but we'll try.

80
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,440
 Yeah, I mean, usually we all agree with each other all of the time.

81
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,000
 Yup.

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
 Makes very difficult to do a podcast.

83
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,080
 Do we?

84
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,800
 Why do we appear?

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
 Why do we agree with each other?

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,200
 [laughs]

87
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,760
 [laughs]

88
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,640
 I love jokes.

89
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,000
 I love the wishing noise they make as they speed by.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,400
 And he just makes some comments about the Chengdu Worldcon.

91
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,640
 Will there ever come a day when fans read or hear that name without a cold finger of dread

92
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
 playfully poking us in our hippocampus?

93
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,560
 Well, we're going to do our best with our regular Chengdu segment right up until October and probably beyond.

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,600
 Yes.

95
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,040
 Good segue Liz.

96
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,360
 Our regular segment about Chengdu is beginning to have more information and less whining,

97
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,440
 because this time Chengdu have opened Hugo nominations.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
 Liz, do you want to summarize what is happening here?

99
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,960
 Chengdu opened Hugo nominations, which I know because they sent me an email about how

100
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,000
 Hugo nominations are open and how to nominate, and I went to the website and logged in and nominated

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
 some stuff, so it's all working, guys.

102
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,720
 But I was hoping you might go into more detail.

103
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,120
 Generally, the fact they've opened Hugo nominations would not be a big deal.

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,200
 It is a big deal, I guess, because it shows them doing something vaguely on time,

105
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,640
 and so it all makes us feel that maybe if they can open Hugo nominations on time,

106
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
 this is a sign you can maybe run a welcome.

107
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,760
 But also they have a special clause, which is about conversion factors for Chinese language nominees,

108
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:10,480
 because four of the categories for the Hugo Awards have word count limits on them.

109
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,840
 So you break short story, novelt, novella and novella up by the number of words in a story,

110
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,640
 and this in previous times has always been used to mean English language words,

111
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,000
 and they have thought about this, and since they're expecting nominations for items written in Chinese,

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,080
 they've decided that there will be a factor of 1.6 when converting.

113
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,840
 I don't know how they came up with that number, but I presume there's some

114
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,440
 statistics about this somewhere that you can calculate what the conversion factor is for language,

115
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,720
 and so essentially a short story is, say, fewer than 7,500 English words or 12,000 Chinese characters.

116
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,240
 It seems like a very sensible way to do it to me. I mean, it's not in the constitution,

117
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,320
 probably because the constitution has never really had to think about that before.

118
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,800
 I guess we've had World Cons in, we have had World Cons of the Countries,

119
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,120
 I mean, the only one I think we've had that uses a non, not the same character set as English is in

120
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,920
 Japan, and then there were no Japanese language nominees, so it didn't have to get thought about,

121
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,240
 but this is clearly going to be a thing, and so it's good that they've announced this now,

122
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,400
 because then if you're nominating something in the Chinese language, you can put it in the right

123
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,880
 category straight away, otherwise you're going to have this horrible mess where there's tons of

124
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,920
 stuff nominated because it has 12,000 Chinese characters, and then they have to try and do a

125
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,320
 conversion factor and say, "Oh, well, actually, this should be a novelist and move everything around,"

126
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,760
 and you'd also presumably, because the word limits are slightly different, end up with a lot of what

127
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,520
 we would think of as novellas that just get shoved in the novel category with everything else,

128
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,680
 so I think it's a good move to announce this ahead of time, and probably something other

129
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,680
 World Cons in the future will have to think about. So yes, my question was how did they decide

130
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,560
 how many characters you got, and I googled very quickly while Liz was explaining and got

131
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:04,400
 19 different answers ranging from 1.2 to 2.1, so you know, I think 1.6 is probably somewhere in the

132
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:12,320
 middle, and they probably took some advice. I do wonder, there are many other languages which use

133
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,800
 the same alphabet as English, but which are more or less compact, and I wonder whether this is

134
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,400
 setting an interesting precedent for items written in other languages.

135
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,960
 It does, I mean, I guess if you were a German World Cons, since you might want to set one for German,

136
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,760
 but I don't know if the conversion factors for other languages are quite so dramatically different.

137
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,200
 Because the average 8000 word short story will translate into 14 German words.

138
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,960
 Yeah, so has there ever been a non-English language work nominated for Hugo?

139
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,560
 Not in the written fiction categories, I don't think.

140
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,320
 Because I was going to ask, when you said about, you made a comment, I can't remember exactly what

141
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,640
 it was of this, but I was wondering, like, obviously this is the first time that there's been a likelihood

142
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,560
 of things written not in Roman characters, but I was curious as to whether or not there had been

143
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,360
 anything that was not in English that had been nominated. Because I don't see why this precedent

144
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,920
 wouldn't hold if you had like a German book. I don't, I mean, unless it is very similar to English,

145
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,960
 which I don't know, so I'd be very interested to find out.

146
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,440
 I think it does depend language by language.

147
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,200
 There's also a 20% kind of wiggle room on the limits anyway, right? So if you're translating

148
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,080
 into a language that doesn't add a lot of verbosity or take it away, then it will make a lot of

149
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,200
 difference and it should be within the limits anyway. It's when you get to things where the

150
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,160
 conversion factor is this high that I guess is an issue. I don't think there's been any fiction

151
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,280
 nominees not in the English language. I think we have had things nominated which were originally

152
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,880
 not published in English, but it was the English translation that was nominated, but I don't think

153
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,520
 anything that was actually not in English has been nominated in the written fiction categories.

154
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,680
 If I've missed something again, expert should write in and let me know. But I feel I'm on

155
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,880
 steady ground with this one.

156
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:18,160
 Nebula nominees are out. Yes, we are all awards all the time this week. It's award season.

157
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,440
 Nebula Awards will be presented on May the 14th, 2023 and there will be a live stream

158
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,920
 and in-person event as part of the 2023 Nebula Conference online.

159
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,800
 So I read a few of these stories and I think you've read a few as well, John.

160
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,120
 Yeah, I have. There's a couple of stories, so obviously there are uncanny stories in here.

161
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,840
 There's one that was nominated that I thought was very good up until the end,

162
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,600
 at which point I thought that it really did just sort of not have an ending. It just sort of fizzled.

163
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,280
 And I find that very difficult with short stories because it's very easy to have a great setup

164
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,320
 for a short story and not stick the landing. It's interesting because the Nebula Award for

165
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,760
 Novella is only 60% tour.com, which is a shockingly poor showing given previous awards late.

166
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,960
 But yeah, no, some interesting stuff. I suspect Beiball and Nona the 9th will be on the Hugo

167
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,120
 Ballot. I suspect Netland Bone will be on the load star Ballot. I don't think it'll be on the

168
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,520
 novel for Hugo. Might be wrong. I don't know what else will come up. It's usually like about half

169
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,760
 and half, right? There's usually about three that cross over? Is that fair? That's not based

170
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,560
 on any stats listeners. That's based on gut intuition. Yeah, I'd have to do some stats. So,

171
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,960
 yeah. But I mean, I wonder if the mountain, the sea will make it because I have heard quite a

172
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,240
 lot of people talking about that. Usually it's a an unexpected thing that came out because,

173
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,200
 you know, I think everyone was expecting like Nona the 9th to be a good and on there, but the

174
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,040
 mountain, the sea has come about out of nowhere. I have read a few of the short fiction nominees,

175
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,120
 and I thought they were mostly good, but not super amazing. But mostly ones that I

176
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,680
 thought would be, you know, if I saw them on a short list, I would be happy with them being on

177
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,040
 a short list. Quite a few of them are from horror magazines and short story, which I don't tend to

178
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,080
 read, so I haven't read those. Yeah, so this is actually Four Shadows, something we will talk

179
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:24,080
 about later. But two of the novelets are novelets I will be nominating for the Hugo award. I will

180
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,120
 talk about those when I talk about that. And one of them is One Eye and I think it doesn't overlap,

181
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,880
 but maybe that's too much foreshadowing. I would say I am a little bit confused by how the Bradbury

182
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,160
 award works for dramatic breast dramatic presentation, because there's nominations for three complete

183
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,160
 series of TV shows and then one episode of Andor. So I don't quite understand how it works,

184
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,880
 you know, do all the nominations for different TV episodes get combined into one nomination for

185
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,440
 series, or do you have to explicitly nominate series? I don't know how it works. And as discussed,

186
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,200
 else always some friends, I don't really think our flag means death is particularly science

187
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,080
 fictional, fantastic. No. As opposed to being a thing fans like watching, but I don't think

188
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,360
 it's going to win anyway, because it's probably going to be a big fight between

189
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,720
 both of the other nominees, to be honest. I'm confused by dramatic presentation, because I'm

190
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,520
 confused. Are you confused, Sean? Are you confused? I'm a bit surprised that Andor got nominated for

191
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,880
 one episode and like not the whole season, but I guess that's just what people nominated. I do

192
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,080
 think that's probably the best episode. And then our flag means death definitely isn't science fiction

193
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,080
 and also definitely won't win. So I think it's probably fine. Yeah. Also, the Nebula Award for

194
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,200
 game writing is interesting. It's Elden Ring, Horizon Forbidden West, journeys through the

195
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,920
 radiant citadel, Pentiment, Stray, and Vampire the Masquerade, Sins of the Spires. Sins of the

196
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:59,600
 Sires, sorry. Yeah, it's Vampire but the Sires, John. The Sires. I think it's fair to say that

197
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,040
 not all of these games have been well received for their gameplay. And I'm not going to say which

198
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,760
 one I'm thinking of particularly, but I can't pronounce it. I'm sure they will have extremely

199
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,440
 good writing. This is one of the things that makes the Nebula game category a bit different

200
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,480
 from the Proceugo one is the very much focuses on the writing and not the gameplay.

201
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,960
 But I hope Horizon wins because Horizon is great. I'm sure Horizon will win. I don't know.

202
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,080
 I'm not. I'm not sure it will. I'm not because it is game writing. So really, it's like,

203
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,480
 oh, instead of making a game, why don't you just tell a story in game form?

204
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,160
 Stray and Elden Ring are both like, were both incredibly well received. So I wouldn't want to

205
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,560
 bet money that they wouldn't take it. So journeys through the radiant citadel is a

206
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,840
 Dungeons and Dragons anthology of one shot venture modules. I think it's 13 modules. I'm

207
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,880
 right wrong about that. It's very tricky to evaluate how you compare the writing in a game

208
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,120
 that will take like 200 hours to play versus the writing in a series of one shots that are

209
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,040
 designed for players to like interact with on the table. I have no idea how you made that

210
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,040
 judgement. But yeah, it's kind of interesting that there's one tabletop product on there.

211
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,120
 It's two tabletop products on there, right? No. Vampire the Masquerade since of the Sires is

212
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,280
 like an interactive steam game. Oh, I see. Okay. That's why I was saying not all of them have

213
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,720
 been well received for gameplay. Because as far as I can tell, it is basically you occasionally

214
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,240
 click and it gets to the end of a very linear story. But perhaps a very well written linear story.

215
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,440
 I really liked Stray, but I think it's going to be hard to think about the writing,

216
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,680
 as opposed to kind of how that interacts with the gameplay. Because would it be half as much fun

217
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,280
 if you were not a little cat rubbing up against robots and getting pets and sleeping on little

218
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,120
 cushions and things. But the writing's not really part of that. It's just you get to be a little cat.

219
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,160
 So we'll see.

220
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:08,800
 Anyway, shall we do the final final part of our three part award roundup this week?

221
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:16,560
 The BSFA. Yes, the BSA. We should say here that we would link to the BSFA website's list of the

222
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,200
 BSFA award nominees. But the BSFA does not have a list of the BSA award nominees. So we're listing

223
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,560
 the file 771 instead. I feel like we said that in 2022. We're going to keep saying it.

224
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:34,720
 Yup. Some interesting stuff on here. Friend of the podcast. Fiona Moore is nominated in

225
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,560
 best non-fiction for her book Management Lessons from Game of Thrones organization,

226
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,560
 Theory and Strategy in Westeros. Which one day we will talk about on the podcast.

227
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,560
 I am reading it. I'm not at the end yet. I've been meaning to have it as a pick for ages.

228
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,800
 Yeah, some other stuff as well. It's all very good. Very different to the Nebula shortlist,

229
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:01,040
 but that is often the case. Yes. And also, I find it quite notable that Adrian Trieskoski

230
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,320
 is nominated for Best Novel for I think one of his five novels out last year, maybe four.

231
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,200
 But you could conceivably have had an all-Adrian Trieskoski Best Novel shortlist.

232
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,840
 And the fact that we didn't is cowardice on the part of BSFA nominators. Come on guys.

233
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,480
 All Trieskoski all the time. It would have been quite funny and all the ones I've read were good

234
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,800
 anyway and I'd be happy to have them nominated. So yeah, come on, let's just do it. Yup. All

235
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,120
 Adrian all the time. I'm hoping that they will do they have done in previous years a little

236
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,080
 voter like booklet for BSFA members. I'm kind of hoping they will do that.

237
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,760
 So I'd quite like to see some of this gorgeous artwork before I actually cast my vote. And you

238
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,720
 know, it'd be good if someone sent me a PDF of it rather than having to quote unquote Google.

239
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,520
 Yeah. Also, I Googled and got the wrong book because there's one with the same name as a book

240
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,360
 which is nominated, but it's not the nominee. And so I got a bit confused. I was like, why is

241
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,520
 this on that? It doesn't look science fiction at all. And it wasn't. Which one was it?

242
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,880
 It was the way the light bends because there's more than one book called the way the light bends.

243
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,520
 Oh, I'm crying.

244
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:13,760
 Hi everyone. This is John. I'm recording this while I'm editing the podcast in a hotel room.

245
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,800
 And I just wanted to let you know that the BSFA sent the voter ban flat out shortly after

246
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:27,040
 you recorded. Now back to the episode. And we don't have any news on whether or not

247
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,000
 the how the voting is going to work. So no, you can probably vote for the awards. We can't tell

248
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,280
 you how, but you probably can. But yeah, BSFA members and Eastcon members are eligible to vote

249
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,160
 in the BSFA awards. So if you have if you think, oh, I'm coming to the Eastcon, but it's never

250
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,480
 occurred to me to vote in the BSFA awards, you should be able to do that. We haven't, I don't think

251
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,280
 we've announced how that's happening yet, but it will be. It looks like BSFA members can vote

252
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,280
 on the BSFA website, but only BSFA members.

253
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:05,200
 Oh, did we mention the everything everywhere all at once? Propulsion last time.

254
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:13,040
 Yeah, but we didn't put it out because it's in the weird bit. Okay, because it has now closed.

255
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,840
 And it was $90,000 for Raccoonie. Oh man, I could have afforded that.

256
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,520
 And also the rock with Googly eyes is a surprisingly big rock.

257
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,360
 Is it? Is it like? I thought it was a small rock, but it's got dimensions and it's like a

258
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:40,240
 foot wide. Hmm. Yeah, 42 pounds, which in real money is about 20 kilos. Yeah, it's quite a big

259
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,080
 rock. There's a massive Googly eyes. Ordeter of the month trophy with $60,000. Yeah.

260
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,120
 And I mean, that you can see how that would be a great present for somebody.

261
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,600
 Yup, yup. But that also is this is being two pounds. That is like a not a very solid artifact.

262
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,560
 Raccoonie was two kilos and someone had to have it on their head. So, you know,

263
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:09,760
 that seems pretty light for an actual puppet. There is a shot on the prop auction site where you

264
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,120
 can buy things, including the hot dog fingers gloves, like just for $36, which doesn't not

265
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,880
 pay $6,000 just a $6. So, you know, but that's merch rather than props. Oh yeah, but I don't know

266
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,400
 anywhere else you can buy hot dog finger gloves. And you can get for $35 and everything everywhere

267
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,880
 pet rock, which comes in a little box that says pet rock on it. This is great. Rock size may vary.

268
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,920
 Oh, oh, there's also a book. It is a pretty great idea to start selling the hot dog fingers.

269
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,440
 Yes. So basically listeners, on the last episode when we recorded, we discussed the prop auction

270
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,600
 very slightly as part of a Hugo discussion we had that we have not yet put out because we're

271
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,760
 going to do it as bonus material. And so this discussion is sort of time difficult, but there

272
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,640
 was a prop auction. It's gone. You just had us talk about it, but I will put a link in the

273
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,880
 show notes because there is also things you can just buy normally without spending that

274
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,600
 spending $1,000. So that might be of interest to people, including the laughing rocks multiverse

275
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,560
 poster, which is an image you can download and print out. Oh, I kind of want that.

276
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,880
 And I think as Alison is spotted, there is a book basically about the multiverse, but

277
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,320
 it's got a forward by Ted Jiang and a Douglas Adams quote in it.

278
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,360
 Oh, nice. Yeah, and a load of interesting things, three short stories,

279
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,680
 all beginning with the same sentence and parallel short fictions and it looks quite an interesting

280
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,200
 book. So if anyone's got that and has read it, it would be great if you could talk to us about it.

281
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,240
 I don't know if there's an e-book. I don't think there's an e-book.

282
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,000
 I think it's just a giant, hardback $50 one unfortunately.

283
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,600
 Boo, it's kind of a giant, hardback art book. Yeah, three tipping booklets, silver cold foil cover.

284
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,080
 Looks very nice, but also very heavy. Oh, they also sell official everything

285
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,960
 everywhere all at once, googly eyes, but they have sold out of those.

286
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,760
 They've sold out.

287
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,360
 Probably them. I don't feel they need to have official googly eyes. I feel googly eyes

288
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,760
 are available in sufficient places. They don't need official branded googly eyes because they've

289
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,760
 already got googly eyes to put the rumble. You put the money on, you put the money on the river.

290
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,640
 I did.

291
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,400
 I've got googly eyes on my rumble too.

292
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:38,800
 Right, picks. Yeah.

293
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,600
 We'll go on then.

294
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,640
 It's like a first.

295
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,600
 You can do.

296
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,080
 All right. My pick is "Losses bookies" or rather the first series of "Losses bookies"

297
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,320
 is an HBO comedy show about a group of friends who create kind of fake horror scenarios for people

298
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,120
 who pay them to do this. So they set up a fake alien invasion and a fake exorcism and things

299
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,480
 like this with their love of horror films and horror makeup and horror props. But it's also just

300
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,360
 unbelievably weird and I can't think of anything else quite like it. It's Spanish language for

301
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,600
 starters. It is set in an unnamed Latin American country, but it's got things like they meet the

302
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,840
 American ambassador where everything is Barbie Pink and she has a load of sort of clean-cut

303
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,280
 Americans who can't do anything at all in the embassy. And it's just all played very, very straight

304
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:36,320
 while being completely weird and off the wall. And it's just kind of lots of fun to watch and

305
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,480
 is not the sort of thing you would ever expect anyone to make a show about but works really well.

306
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,080
 Anyway, I've watched series one because that is once available on my streaming service.

307
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,000
 Series two is out, but I haven't watched it yet because I don't have it on streaming yet,

308
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,720
 but it wasn't 2022. So I'm going to try and get to it in case it is a potential Hugo

309
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,320
 nominee. And yeah, I just really enjoyed spending half an hour in this kind of

310
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:05,840
 strange universe where they're faking up horror things working through props and makeup and so on.

311
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,160
 But also there is clearly like an actual real supernatural element going on. Someone possessed

312
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,800
 by a demon and a cursed mirror. And then, you know, they buy the cursed mirror like we told

313
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,600
 you to buy a non-cursed mirror. Like it's just all very kind of straight and day to day. And

314
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,440
 John is laughing so I presume John has also watched lots of spooky and enjoyed it.

315
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,400
 It was so good. He's like, well, I bought the cursed mirror because I'm spooky. It's

316
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,360
 isn't helpful. Like, oh, the cursed mirror looked the best. They're like, yes, that's because it's

317
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,400
 cursed mirror. Yeah. And she's so cross. And I, yeah, I love, I don't want to spoil it, but I love

318
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,880
 the way that plotline resolves the end of the episode is bloody brilliant. No, it's great.

319
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,480
 Yeah, for all the reasons you've said, just very, very good. It's Fred Armisen in part.

320
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:59,040
 Julio Torres, Anna Faberge and Fred Armisen. So Anna Faberge plays Tati and Julio Torres plays

321
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:05,760
 Andres Valdez, who is the adopted heir to a chocolate empire. And his parents, his parents

322
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,960
 are mysterious. I don't think that ever come. I don't know why. So mysterious.

323
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,040
 There's mysterious memories. You never see their faces. They're never shot full on you. We see

324
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:22,480
 them like obscured by something. But there's no reason because they're just obviously completely

325
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,640
 like boring normal people, but you only ever see them shot in a really mysterious way.

326
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:34,080
 And it's never explained. It's so weird. And Tati like has, she's been catfished, but she

327
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,920
 is being catfished. She definitely thinks she's been catfished. Yeah, she's talking to

328
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:48,720
 prince on the internet. Nothing we are saying makes any sense to any of your listeners.

329
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,000
 I am so sorry, but you should watch this show because it is ridiculous. Or indeed to me.

330
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,520
 It's so good. Yeah, I recommend. Yeah. Ask a pick. I should have picked that at some point,

331
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,560
 but I'm glad I waited until you picked it because it is good to have someone to basically just make

332
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,440
 completely incomprehensible statements across one another. Yeah, we are this people going,

333
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,400
 oh, you remember that bit? Wasn't really good that bit. And then there was that thing with the dog.

334
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,040
 And it was really good. And then, you know, there was a bit with the mirror. And yeah,

335
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,880
 people who do that are really, really annoying.

336
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,400
 Okay, so no, I just sewn that guys. So I hope that was interesting. Should I do my pick?

337
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,160
 All right, Johnny, you're going to do your pick. Yeah, what did you pick at an allison?

338
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:37,200
 I still haven't done very many genre appropriate things, but I went last night to see Allegiance,

339
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,920
 which is a musical. It is the passion project of George Takai, who was interned as a small boy,

340
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:54,080
 as part of the Interment of Japanese Americans in the Second World War. And he got some help and

341
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,760
 produced a musical about this. And it ran on Broadway for a short while, and then closed,

342
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,440
 and has had several revivals because of Takai basically going, no, no, no, I really

343
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,600
 bought this story out there. I really wanted to be told. And it is currently playing until I think

344
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:16,000
 the 8th of April at the Charing Cross Theatre in London, which is technically not a Western

345
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,200
 theatre, though you would think it was in the West End. It's a very tiny theatre under the arches

346
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:28,880
 by Charing Cross Station. And the musical is, I think, it has mixed reviews. And I think I didn't

347
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,880
 think it was very good, but you might want to go and see it anyway. It's an important story,

348
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,720
 so if you don't know the story, then I think that's a good reason to go and see it. And there are

349
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,320
 some good performances. And in particular, Takai is very, very good and very well worth watching.

350
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,640
 And the man is 85. So if you would like to see him live on stage and afterwards go and meet him in

351
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,040
 the Q&A stage door and get your programme signed, they were very careful to say, we are only signing

352
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:03,600
 items from Allegiance. We are not going to sign items from any other show that any of the actors

353
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,400
 might have been involved in at any time. Then you can do that. And the tickets are not particularly

354
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,640
 expensive by London standards. I think there are 20-pound tickets for every show, but obviously,

355
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,840
 you know, it's hard to get those ones. But I think our tickets are about 40 quid, which is not

356
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,560
 unusual for which is not bad for London. And it's tiny theatre, so everyone has a good view.

357
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,560
 And so you might well want to go and see it, because Takai is very good. And the man is 85.

358
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,320
 He's exactly the same age as my dad was, just about a month older than my dad.

359
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,520
 And one of the things we said at my parents' funeral was, oh, one of the things they kept telling us

360
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,160
 was we were brought up in the war, don't you know? And I think that is also very true of Takai

361
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,320
 and very relevant to this show. And it's possible that war didn't affect him in quite the way it

362
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,160
 affected my parents. I think it's a different experience. But it was interesting seeing that experience

363
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,360
 and having the relevance to it. So yeah, enjoy myself. Thank you to Farah, friend of the show,

364
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,920
 Farah Mendelssohn, for sorting out that theatre trip. Weirdly related. I mean, it's not, I'm going

365
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,280
 to kind of have a bonus pick here, but if anyone hasn't read "Like, Petrol" by Francis Buffard,

366
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,080
 it's not really science fictional, but it's just kind of he imagines an alternate world in which

367
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,960
 five children were killed during a bomb attack in London in the war. And just imagines kind of

368
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,760
 the alternate universe if they lived. And it's about, you know, what their stories would have been.

369
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,680
 And it's just kind of very kind of sweetly written, kind of imagining, you know, these five people's

370
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,920
 lives with their ups and downs and what would have happened to them if they'd grown up, but they

371
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,480
 all died in 1944. It's all fictional, but I thought that was quite a nice novel from the

372
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,720
 past couple of years that's similarly about what would have happened if things were different.

373
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,560
 I have read something since last time, but I probably don't want to pick it.

374
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:55,440
 In episode 42 listeners, I'm sure you all remember episode 42. It was "I'm Up for Running

375
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,160
 Control Con". I used to have a different face. Alison was going to Smothcon, and Liz was in disguise.

376
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:10,160
 And we did picks and Liz picked a book by a man called Adrian Tchaikovsky, and it was an easy

377
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,640
 decision to pick a book by him because he's written half of all books. So, you know,

378
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,280
 you're going to end up picking one at some point.

379
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,480
 He's written the entire 2024 BSFA shortlist.

380
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:30,080
 You heard it here first. And Liz picked children of ruin, Eibley.

381
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,480
 Sounds quite possible. I read it.

382
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,440
 I'm current. I am currently reading children of ruin, but I'm not going to pick children of ruin

383
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,400
 because I have not finished it yet. But I am going to pick children of time,

384
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,840
 which we haven't picked before, and is therefore a completely crombulent pick.

385
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:54,320
 So children of time is good book. Children of time won the Arthur C. Clark Award. It was published

386
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:01,520
 in 2015. If you are an arachnophobe, I don't know whether you should read this book. If anyone

387
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,440
 listening is an arachnophobe that has read it, please write in because I would find that very

388
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,280
 interesting to hear. Liz is putting her hand up in her.

389
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,120
 I'm not a super arachnophobe, but like I will scroll past pictures of spiders on Facebook very,

390
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
 very quickly. And I read it and it was all right.

391
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,880
 Okay, that's good. So yeah, so this is a novel about spiders.

392
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:28,720
 It's a novel about a very strange lady and a planet which hasn't gone so well,

393
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,240
 and how that all pans out. And it's incredible. I think it was the first

394
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,120
 Tricosteky novel I read because I was like, I should really read some by him because he's very good.

395
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,320
 Everyone says so. And I decided to read that one because it was the one that would want the

396
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:49,680
 Clark. But it is fantastic. It has the benefit that children of memory has just come out,

397
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,240
 which is the third in this series. I'm reading Children of Ruin, and it has been a while since

398
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,760
 I read Children of Time, but Children of Ruin is also really, really good so far.

399
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,760
 I have just reached the point where I think the shit has hit the fan, and I'm curious to see

400
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,000
 how it will be distributed. But yeah, it's just amazing and I highly recommend it.

401
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,680
 So if you are thinking I should really read some Tricosteky before Easton,

402
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,840
 and you are at a loss for which of his many books you should dive into,

403
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,880
 I would highly recommend Children of Time as your entry point. I think it would be a good pick

404
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,720
 for anyone in that situation. And I would say I think, I mean, I'd read Empire of Black and Gold.

405
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,160
 So I'd read Men of Tricosteky before Children of Time. But that seems to me to mark the point

406
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,840
 where I think he's writing a step up. And also his kind of recognition and notice took a step up,

407
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,440
 because that was the point where I think he started to see him really getting on award short lists.

408
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,000
 And you know, I've seen it and chopped the Little Clark Award winner logo on and everything.

409
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,840
 So I think it's been doing quite well. No, Children of Ruin has a little sticker saying

410
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,600
 the previous book in the series won the Clark Award on it. It's very nice. Also, another little

411
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:04,480
 cheeky pick, which is if anyone here listening is a fan of podcasts and also tabletop games,

412
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,440
 there is an actual play podcast called Force Mature. And I'm not going to recommend the entire podcast.

413
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:17,120
 I'm going to recommend a very specific sub part of the podcast, which is that they have recently

414
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,720
 finished an arc. Well, I think they actually finished their main campaign. So they have been

415
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:31,280
 doing some other stuff since they have finished. They did a little four episode arc, which is called

416
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,160
 the outer dark trilogy part two. I admit I did not listen to the outer dark trilogy part one.

417
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,000
 They played the first parts using an OSR system that I wasn't particularly interested in listening

418
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,960
 to. So I didn't listen. But the second part they played using the Skomon villainy system,

419
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,720
 which I was very interested in listening to because it's a sci-fi hack of Blade in the Dark. And

420
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,680
 basically it has some of the usual suspects, but it also has Agent Shrykowski, who is very good

421
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,120
 and plays a very interesting character. And it also has John Robertson, who does the Dark Room.

422
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,880
 And if you have watched the Dark Room, you can imagine John Robertson role playing

423
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,440
 and imagine how fun that might be. He plays a satire of an American author who likes guns too

424
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:23,360
 much, which I think he's doing Larry Corea. I think not sure, but very, very funny.

425
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,560
 There's a few.

426
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,000
 Yeah, there are. Yes, it doesn't necessarily narrow it down to one, but it is very, very good. So if

427
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,400
 you do like actual plays and people being ridiculous, I would recommend listening to the outer dark

428
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:43,360
 trilogy part two episodes one to four. It's very good. And also another sneaky bonus pick. The Dark

429
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,200
 Room. If you get the opportunity to see the Dark Room, the Dark Room is amazing. I saw it at

 EasterCon for the first time a while back. And yeah, just if it's near you, go see it,

431
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,920
 because it is very funny. And it is SF-NOL. For shadowing. That was The Ultimate Podcast.

432
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,240

 A short list of science fiction novels. You should not read if you're a director of

435
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,640
 hope. There's a few. Yep. Esther, if you're listening. That's my nomination for the Glasgow

436
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,880
 special category for Hugo's best spider-related novel. Because you know, it's about time we had

437
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,920
 an all-aidery Tchaikovsky Hugo category. So let's make it happen. The theme music for this
