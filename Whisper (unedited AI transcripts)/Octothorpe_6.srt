00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
 What's talking about science fiction? Anyway, shall we talk about the Hugo

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:20,720
 Vollist? We want to talk about science fiction, John.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,580
 Hello everyone. Welcome to episode six of the OctaThorp podcast, a podcast about science

4
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,260
 fiction and SF fandom. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:45,740
 And we have a letter of comment from Ispania Sheriff, my wife, who attended a one-day

6
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,260
 convention called Wifi Sci-Fi, which was hosted by Anne Colette and it was a

7
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,700
 minicon consisting of a single Zoom panel in two parts followed by breakout

8
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,440
 room cabbie clutches. The panel had the topic SF and the pandemic tackled by

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,840
 five panelists and then the second half of the panel was on the same topic but

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,420
 with different panelists and then afterwards you were assigned randomly

11
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,780
 to a breakout room with one of the panelists and in Ispania's case she

12
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,460
 talked to Corey L. Lee who was charming and then suddenly switched out to Adrian

13
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,980
 J. Walker who was also lots of fun. This is the second Wifi Sci-Fi event that has

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,500
 been run and you can find more details at ancolettes.co.uk/wificell

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,740
 I did not go but I heard Ispania having a lot of fun. I believe I was playing

16
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,180
 board games on the internet while that was happening. Is that because you are

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,980
 playing board games on the internet roughly 50% of the time you are awake?

18
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:42,340
 No that is a that is a vicious lie. At least 25th of the time that I am awake I

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,540
 am playing them in real life so there you go. I think this is the second Wifi

20
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,900
 Sci-Fi event isn't it? Yes. Clearly the first one went well if they've done a

21
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,540
 second one and it seems like a kind of nice way to spend three hours on a

22
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,220
 Saturday afternoon. And it sounds like they've got the social aspects down a bit

23
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,460
 by just like randomly allocating you to a room and you have a chat which is

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:13,660
 yeah. Yeah I am wondering whether this kind of mini convention will turn out to

25
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,620
 be a really viable way of doing programming in the kind of current

26
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,300
 virtual age because it means you can really pick and choose what panels you

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,060
 want to go to. If like three people a weekend run a panel with some socialising

28
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,060
 afterwards you can massively split the amount of effort between a lot of

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,540
 different people you don't have to have a centralised effort and you can pick

30
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,980
 and choose what events you want to go to which is potentially very cool. I've

31
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,780
 done a lot of Zoom parties now and I'm coming to the conclusion that for kind

32
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,740
 of just having a good time a number at around 30 to 40 is well maybe probably

33
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,020
 less than that say invite 30 so that 25 or 20 turn up is really quite good

34
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,620
 because that's enough for three different solid conversations which is

35
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,820
 all anyone's really going to get into anyway and and when you have more people

36
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,340
 you just up the level of complexity of keeping everyone organised and it doesn't

37
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,220
 necessarily do any better for people so so larger meetings aren't necessarily

38
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,260
 better the advantage of great big conventions or great big gatherings

39
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,940
 generally is that more of the people you want to see will be there but you can

40
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,060
 actually set up a virtual event with just the people you want to see on a

41
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,500
 particular topic. I think for Zoom parties it's also not quite the size of

42
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,900
 the room but the people in the room you need a certain amount of people in the

43
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,340
 room who are reasonably happy to sit there and chat on Zoom and you probably

44
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,540
 have some people who are sitting and chatting a little bit but mostly sort of

45
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,540
 happy to listen like you need to replicate the dynamics of the conversation

46
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,180
 in the Zoom if you have a quite full Zoom room but no one kind of knows each

47
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,300
 other well and then not actually chatting then that's not going to work either

48
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,820
 so the Wi-Fi sci-fi approach of having all right the author is in this room and

49
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,540
 you can chat to the author it gives us all focus to them in a way that a

50
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,220
 general Zoom room party does not. I have just realised that I have never

51
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,980
 personally had the experience of being in a Zoom room and having nobody in the

52
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,140
 room being willing to chat. I didn't want to name names it may be that not

53
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,460
 everyone's experience is equivalent because I have like however much

54
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,380
 endless management training from years and years and years being tried to

55
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,380
 become a corporate cloud and failing I know I never find it difficult to start

56
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,780
 conversations in empty rooms. It's also true that you will never be in the you

57
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,180
 know when you when you have Zoom parties and put people into breakout rooms you

58
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,980
 are never in the room you are not in. Yes if that makes sense. Yes. Like you

59
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,940
 never know what's going on in the other rooms so you probably assume that all

60
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,540
 rooms are kind of chatting away happily whereas I have been in Zoom breakout

61
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,580
 rooms which are a little bit quieter and you're sort of waiting for someone to

62
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:14,420
 get things going. The problem with a Zoom party I think no actually the problem

63
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,500
 with a party is when you invite all of your friends and you're the only person

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,580
 that everyone knows and so that means that you get the clicks and if you've got

65
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,380
 like a couple of people who you're great mates with but I really know the rest of

66
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,460
 your friends at all they're going to find a very difficult to interact and

67
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,660
 that's true at any party but I think it's also true in Zoom parties where if

68
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,740
 you've got a group of people all of whom don't really know each other and only

69
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,860
 really know the host and the host is in a different breakout room that will

70
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,660
 obviously be a problem. Okay so my most recent Zoom party was credited as

71
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,260
 specifically a chance for European and Australian and New Zealand fans to get

72
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,980
 together at a time which was more or less convenient for both of them but not

73
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,460
 convenient for Americans because it had a structure I think that helped somewhat

74
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,900
 with the thing and I kind of pretended that they were there to help me plan my

75
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,820
 guff trip which they weren't they were just there to foster relations

76
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,980
 between European and Australian and New Zealand fans which I think it did though

77
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,980
 we did actually get any New Zealand fans except for Ming and Smitty who don't

78
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,220
 count. For those who don't know Ming and Smitty both used to live in the UK before

79
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,180
 emigrating to New Zealand and so counting them as New Zealand fans is

80
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,820
 obviously fine but may not be the New Zealand fans you're trying to reach out

81
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,420
 to in this particular case. I will also say on the topic of Australian and New

82
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:40,860
 Zealand fandom we were recommended by Claire Breyerley a podcast called the

83
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,180
 two chairs talking podcast which is hosted by David Greek and Perry Middle

84
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:53,820
 Miss who are ex-chairs of the of of previous Australian World Cons and I gave

85
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,460
 that lesson in between last episode and this episode and it's quite good they

86
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,100
 talk about books if you like Australian people talking about books you may also

87
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,220
 enjoy it so give it a look. Yes and they also I think record on a fortnightly

88
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,220
 schedule as we do and they have quite a lot 27 episodes so far so they're a bit

89
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,740
 ahead of us.

90
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:23,660
 On the topic of things that have happened in recent times the Hugo finalist's

91
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,780
 came out and we touched on this in a previous episode but we haven't really

92
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,620
 talked about it in any great detail yet so we're going to talk a little bit about

93
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,620
 that today. And also the BSFA Awards were announced in a glittering ceremony on

94
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,220
 Zoom. I think three hours late because they timed their award ceremony to

95
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,660
 coincide with Zoom's first major outage since the start of lockdown which is a

96
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,660
 tiny bit unfortunate but I think they recovered quite well. Oh that's

97
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,180
 unfortunate. Did you actually virtually attend? I did not because of the whole

98
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,660
 middle of the night issue. I did not. I did not because of the whole not being a

99
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,340
 member of the BSFA issue which I I've become I'm feeling increasingly embarrassed

100
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,820
 about actually because one of the things I have been doing in lockdown is that

101
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:15,500
 they've been running author readings to compensate for not being able to do

102
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,860
 their regular pub meetings on a Wednesday in the middle of the month and I've

103
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,740
 gone to a couple of these and they've been jolly good. So I turns out that author

104
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,260
 readings are one of the things I quite like in lockdown. I like to be able to

105
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,380
 put on an author reading while I'm working with my hands. Which is also good

106
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,500
 because when I was more involved in the BSFA one of the things people would

107
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,420
 generally say is the London meetings are great but I live outside London and

108
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,500
 can't get to them and so in lockdown if they're now doing things broadcast by

109
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,700
 Zoom again they can have a slightly wider audience. Yeah I think I say Zoom

110
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,500
 there but I think it's actually Facebook Live so now they will only get

111
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,140
 criticisms from people who are outside London and hate Facebook. It's the BSFA

112
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,940
 vector reading series and we should probably put a link in the show notes.

113
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,340
 We shall do that. So the BSFA Awards this year are great all of them I think. The

114
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,420
 winner was of the best novel was Children of Ruin by Adrian Shikovsky.

115
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,980
 Best shorter fiction. This is How You Lose the Time War by Amal Al-Matar and Max Gladstone.

116
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,780
 Best nonfiction was the pleasant professor of Robert A. Highline, Farah Mendelssohn

117
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,700
 and Best Art work was the cover for Warism and Other Stories by Ian Waits

118
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,260
 by Chris Baker who's obviously better known as Fangorn. Yeah and they streamed

119
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,580
 it on Zoom as we mentioned. It seemed to go well I saw people talking about it on

120
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,380
 Twitter. I must admit I didn't watch because I am also not a member of the BSFA

121
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,980
 although I am on the BSFA discord so you know maybe I should join up. It does seem

122
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,540
 like they're doing some cool stuff for the machine. I should probably be on the

123
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,460
 BSFA discord for that matter. That sounds like good people doing good things on it.

124
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,980
 Yes I think they need to plug it slightly more because I think at the moment it is

125
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,900
 rather quiet. I get the impression they're using it for their committee

126
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,940
 meetings so I think it is being used internally by the BSFA and is therefore

127
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,300
 at least somewhat active. We should put a link in the show notes.

128
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:22,420
 Sorry yes I have read most of Thora's book which I found pretty interesting.

129
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,980
 People keep thinking it's a biography which it's not it's a close reading so

130
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,860
 it's probably of most interest to people who have read all of Highline's books

131
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,820
 but quite a long time ago because I think actually Thora coming to it with a

132
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,860
 fresh eye here in the 21st century is quite interesting.

133
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,140
 I have read only this is how you lose the time war which I definitely enjoyed

134
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,780
 but I think I enjoyed it but it didn't kind of speak to me in my heart the way

135
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,180
 it has to a lot of people. I know it is one of those books that comes along

136
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:02,740
 occasionally and a lot of people really really love it and I merely liked it and

137
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,140
 really enjoyed it and admired it and think it's quite well done.

138
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,900
 I will read this is how you lose the time war because it is on the Hugo finalists

139
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,740
 this year so I will be reading it as part of my Hugo reading. I will read

140
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,140
 Children of Ruin because I read the previous book in that series which I

141
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:27,300
 thoroughly enjoyed after a colleague in my research group recommended it which

142
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,700
 was called Children of Time and that was that was an amazing read so I do really

143
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,180
 want to read Children of Ruin but I haven't got run to it yet.

144
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:45,180
 But I have been reading the Hugo finalists I've made a start on chewing

145
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,460
 through some of those and I've also obviously kind of watched and read

146
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,300
 various bits of the Hugo finalists over the last year when they were

147
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,860
 actually coming out and so we're going to talk a little bit about what on the

148
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,580
 ballot that we have read what we're planning to read what we enjoyed and what

149
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,500
 we didn't enjoy out of the stuff we know about and so the thing we're

150
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 probably the most well up to date with is the best dramatic presentation

151
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,460
 categories which I think the three of us have have watched most of so shall we

152
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,500
 start with long form. Yeah I've seen everything on BDP long form apart from

153
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,140
 Star Wars which I did mean to go and see but it came out at the point when I was

154
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,580
 about to go off on a long holiday back at the times when I was allowed to get

155
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,340
 on planes for a long period of time and the reviews came out and everyone said

156
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:44,620
 oh it's fine oh it's alright oh it's not that great really and I thought fine I'll

157
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,660
 just go and see it later and then I forgot around to it so I haven't seen it

158
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,060
 I understand it's fine to bad. I really liked it it made me laugh and grin and

159
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,780
 clap and do all of those things I can entirely understand why people might not

160
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:03,660
 have liked it. I think it is not a well-made movie but it is a fun movie and I

161
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,820
 thoroughly enjoyed myself when I watched it. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed

162
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,980
 Endgame and that might be controversial. Endgame's plot fundamentally made no

163
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,340
 sense to me and no one else seems to have this problem which is weird given

164
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,660
 the number of people that had a problem that last year and I had a hyperspace

165
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,300
 jump in it but like I don't know the time travel the Endgame was just nonsense

166
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,260
 I don't I liked it it was fun it was a good ride time travel is nonsense in all

167
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:33,300
 films apart from Luper basically so I just oh 12 monkeys sorry yes I did mean

168
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,540
 primer not Luper. Time travel in the first Terminator movie holds up very well

169
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,180
 it's just that Terminator 2 went back and ruined it shall I go back and do sorry

170
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,780
 no we're not gonna let you undo your mistakes Liz this is all going straight

171
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:53,740
 I had the same reaction every time I see a JJ Abrams film which is that I leave

172
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,060
 the cinema going I thoroughly enjoyed that he did justice to the franchise

173
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:07,260
 that he is working in and then over the next few hours or days or weeks the

174
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:14,700
 critical part of my brain goes well did he really all he has done is parrot and

175
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:20,700
 eight bits of it without adding to or extending them in a way that is clever

176
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:28,620
 or interesting he just serves up fan service that is the cinematic equivalent

177
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,580
 of a shoe bun and I'm not saying I don't like shoe buns but I feel that this was

178
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,380
 the culmination of a series that I've been watching since I was 12 years old

179
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,420
 and we deserved a little bit more than that especially given the second episode

180
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,660
 had done quite a lot to say we are taking this in a direction that isn't just

181
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:57,140
 giving adolescent men in America what they want so I've got two reactions to

182
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,420
 that which is firstly I think that take on the two Abrams Star Wars movies

183
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,020
 fundamentally ignores one of their greatest strengths which is I think the

184
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,300
 characterization in both of them is the best characterization in any of the

185
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,260
 Star Wars movies I especially think that's clear in the first act of rise of

186
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:18,420
 Skywalker where the interaction between Rey and Poe and Finn does an awful lot to

187
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,700
 tell you how much time has passed and how much they've gone through in between

188
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,180
 last Jedi and rise of Skywalker in a way that doesn't need to be written down

189
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,700
 because it's all there in the direction and the acting and I actually think

190
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,540
 Abrams is the best director that has ever directed a Star Wars movie which

191
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:40,340
 may be controversial I think last Jedi was fantastic I do enjoy last Jedi I do

192
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,620
 wish that they hadn't decided to fundamentally reanalyze what it is to be

193
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,180
 Star Wars in the eighth part of a nine part series because I think that made it

194
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,980
 very difficult to tell a coherent story I think if the eighth part of your series

195
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,580
 is something like but now what about something completely different there are

196
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,180
 problems there and I think the other half of what's wrong with rise of Skywalker

197
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,500
 is that it is very difficult to work out how you get from the end of the last

198
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,580
 Jedi to the end of the nine part saga in a way that's anything approaching

199
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,940
 narratively satisfying I do think that rise of Skywalker has some absolute

200
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,420
 bobbins in it and it reminds me a little bit of some of the Rossel T. Davis

201
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,100
 work on Doctor Who where you've got the bit at the end spoilers for those who

202
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,380
 haven't seen rise of Skywalker there's a bit at the end Liz do you mind if I

203
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,740
 spoil rise of Skywalker no go for it go for it go for it there's a bit at the

204
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,900
 end where the Emperor basically uses force lightning on an entire solar

205
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,540
 system and it's a bit like did we need that no if we did did that did we need a

206
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,100
 little bit of text they explained why that was okay probably I didn't mind it

207
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,860
 it wasn't great it's but Abrams does this he does the infinitely ratcheting up

208
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,260
 the stakes which does cheapen the stakes in the earlier movies which is a shame

209
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,300
 but generally speaking I thought it had flaws but I did genuinely generally

210
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,500
 really enjoy it I still think the best of the three pre the best of the three

211
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,220
 sequel movies is The Force Awakens which I thought in many ways was almost

212
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,980
 perfect and I thoroughly enjoyed but that is by tape can we agree that you

213
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,500
 should not give the Hugo to it I was suggested at the end of this segment we

214
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,900
 decide who we should give the Hugo to I have ideas neither of them are rise of

215
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,740
 Skywalker so I am not arguing that it should be Hugo Victor haha the Hugo

216
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,540
 Victor Hugo it was a pun

217
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:36,180
 I have not seen the two episodes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe extruded

218
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:42,580
 product because it is getting very large and life is too short you only need to

219
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,620
 watch two movies and two television series a year or something and you're

220
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:54,780
 all right but that I genuinely enjoy the MCU I enjoyed Captain Marvel although in

221
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,660
 a way it was like okay this is maybe the 10th or 12th superhero origin story in

222
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,580
 the MCU I have seen and the exciting bit is now they keep setting them in

223
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,740
 different random decades so they can have a different soundtrack and you can go

224
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,900
 oh it's got some 90s things in but I did I did still enjoy it I would probably

225
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,060
 go and watch another one I was thoroughly entertained for two and a half

226
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:24,660
 hours or whatever it is and it is nice to see a female lead yes Brie Larson

227
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,900
 is someone I really like and so I liked her in it I will say so I think I think

228
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,020
 Alison's point about it being the extruded Marvel Cinematic product which

229
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,540
 is a very evocative metaphor which I love I think it's true and I think it's

230
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,300
 difficult because I think one of the really shining things the MCU has done

231
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,060
 and whether or not you like the way it's done it it's really interesting that

232
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:54,860
 they've taken a story and told it over a series of 20 movies with ancillary

233
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,580
 material because I don't think that's really ever been done before and in the

234
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,380
 closest you've probably got is James Bond but that doesn't tell anything near a

235
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:08,620
 single story and so I think I think in some ways the MCU is actually really

236
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,220
 revolutionary in a way that people aren't really talking about but I think

237
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,420
 part of that is because it is really revolutionary at telling a story where a

238
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,980
 lot of the beats are repeated and I could definitely see why there are people

239
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,100
 who are getting to the point where they're like this is a bit I have gotten to

240
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,180
 the end of my patience with this compared with most people I know I have very

241
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,620
 low tolerance for the same story being told over and over with bigger bits over

242
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,580
 series I'm television series as well I also struggle with this and we will get

243
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,220
 to why I think the two short television series are my favorite things of what I

244
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:53,300
 have so far seen I thought Good Omens was rather good I wasn't particularly

245
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,140
 expecting it I mean I kind of knew it was in production I think that they did

246
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:04,820
 it in a way that did not overstay its welcome I think that the fact that gaming

247
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,700
 was on board probably helped sharpen the script to match modern sensibilities

248
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,180
 because Good Omens is 30 years old now and there are there is a lot of subtext

249
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,940
 in that novel that is not made anything like as clear as it was made in the

250
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,300
 series I thought a lot of ways that they used animation and time travel and

251
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,340
 all of that sort of thing were very clever and I thoroughly enjoyed it and

252
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,380
 of the ones I've seen on this list which as you know is not very many it's my

253
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:40,980
 second best I also enjoyed Good Omens I think I first read Good Omens when I was

254
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,500
 10 or 11 years old and I loved it and it remains you know a book I have reread

255
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,860
 many times of the year and still really enjoy and while I like the TV

256
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,540
 adaptation it is almost too faithful to the books it felt to me like there was

257
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,060
 too much trying to keep a lot of the actual wording of the books in by having

258
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:06,700
 some pretty unnecessary narration narration from God and some of the bits

259
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,940
 they kept in I think you could have cut entirely and also I think some of the

260
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,940
 bits with yes I think some of the stuff with Sergeant Shadwell and Madam Tracy

261
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,620
 has not aged particularly well and it's really noticeable in the show minus

262
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,140
 spoiler the bit where Aziraphale sort of takes over Madam Tracy's body works

263
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,980
 much much better in the books because in the TV show it just puts Michael Sheen

264
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,120
 out of action for an episode so I would really like to actually if they've

265
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,020
 trimmed it more maybe trimmed out some of the bikers of the apocalypse trimmed

266
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,500
 out these bits that I think don't work as well on screen and it was almost too

267
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,580
 faithful but it was way way better than what I feared we might get so I can't

268
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,460
 complain too much so I will say I think I agree with you I think it was too

269
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,140
 faithful I think they should have taken more liberties with it and I am also

270
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,980
 in the same boat that I think I read Good Omens when I was 10 or 11 and it

271
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,180
 remains a very very fond memory it was the book that introduced me to both

272
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,300
 Pratchett and Gaiman's writing so it will always have a place in my heart I

273
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,900
 think I agree with you that they needed to do more to make it into a TV show

274
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,700
 rather than into a TV version of a book I will say that I thought the

275
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,340
 chemistry between most of the characters was amazing and I thought the actors did

276
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,460
 a tremendous job I am happy that Michael Sheen and David Tennant are getting a

277
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,580
 lockdown TV show together as far as I could tell off the back of the fact that

278
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,220
 they were good together in Good Omens which is Chef's Kiss I thought Jack White

279
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,180
 Hall was very good which surprised me because I was expecting not to think

280
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,260
 he was very good the thing you said about the bikers of the

281
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,700
 pocket is really interesting because my main problem with that is that they

282
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,380
 cut out all of the funny bits are left in all of the other bits and I think

283
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,660
 they really needed to decide whether they were going to keep the hilarious

284
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,060
 other four bikers which made it work or whether they were going to really slim

285
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,100
 down that whole thing but they sort of went for a middle road where they took

286
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,700
 the funny bit out and that I'm not sure I do wonder whether that's because it

287
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,220
 was Neil Gaiman that was overseeing the adaptation and not Terry Pratchett

288
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,060
 because I wonder whether some of the more out there funny bits of Good Omens were

289
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,740
 more on Pratchett's side than Gaiman's shall we say but generally speaking I

290
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,980
 thought it was very good I'm not sure it's my favorite of the

291
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,420
 roster but I really liked it. Gaiman is very good at whimsy but he is not a

292
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:32,260
 humorist in the way that Pratchett was and very little of Gaiman's solo output

293
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,900
 is not out loud hilarious so I think you can reasonably assume that everything

294
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,180
 properly funny in Good Omens comes from Pratchett. Everything that's

295
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,700
 properly funny and I think properly sort of sharp

296
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,540
 humor as well seems to be me to be more of a Pratchett thing than a Gaiman thing.

297
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,260
 I mean obviously this is all speculation and we may be entirely wrong but it

298
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,940
 seems reasonable for more we know about the two authors.

299
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,860
 With a bit of luck we'll get a lock from Neil Gaiman telling us how we're going.

300
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,740
 Ha ha yes Neil please write in and tell us how we've gotten all this wrong we

301
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,100
 would love to hear from you.

302
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:15,300
 I really liked Russian doll I like lots of things it did and I like the fact that

303
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,780
 just I think I hadn't noticed when it came out that Netflix was in the habit

304
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,020
 of just sticking up some stuff that was quite out there

305
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,060
 and I like that Russian doll is I don't think it's like hugely original

306
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:36,180
 but I like the fact it was clearly quite cheap to make and so therefore

307
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,620
 it doesn't have when you reap novels and they're

308
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,180
 great and interesting and weird you think well if this had been made into a

309
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,580
 film or a television series people would have

310
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,180
 shaved bits off the edges to make them fit more tightly into a mold of what

311
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,100
 they think extruded cinematic products should be like

312
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,020
 and Russian doll absolutely doesn't do that it's got a load of characters

313
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,620
 and they're quite wild and they do a load of things you know a heroine is

314
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,660
 actually spectacularly not particularly nice in a way that

315
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,980
 is not that common even in the more elaborately very television that we get

316
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,820
 now and it's short so they made quite a short amount of it

317
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,780
 and it tells a whole story and then it's done and I don't know if their plan is

318
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,620
 to do anymore obviously when things are a big success on Netflix they tend to do a

319
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,820
 second series oh that's a little bit of a shame but it feels like it told a whole

320
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,420
 story and it was done and it was and it had lots of

321
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,940
 proper science fictional content which even now even with all the science

322
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,620
 fictionters around us all the time we don't get as much of that as we

323
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,620
 maybe should and I thought it was funny and entertaining

324
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,740
 and I that's what I want from my long-form dramatic presentations thank you

325
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,460
 very much and don't necessarily get it though it was

326
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,900
 kind of it's kind of eight short-form dramatic presentations so

327
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,700
 it once again demonstrated that the hugo categories are very complicated

328
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,900
 I think I would say that it feels like something which fits much better in

329
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,100
 long-form than many series which have been nominated

330
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,580
 long-form because I think it does tell one complete story over eight episodes

331
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,380
 and that's one reason why it's so satisfying to watch

332
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,780
 without spoiling it it is not a concept that is entirely new

333
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:23,620
 I did think that it is quite innovative in that it is a very

334
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,580
 dark comedy in a way that you don't often see

335
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:33,300
 US kind of situation comedies do and the he bleakness of it

336
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,780
 and the humor of it was really refreshing I really liked that

337
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,660
 I think it's relatively unusual for comedy to be taken seriously it's

338
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,700
 relatively unusual for genre to be taken seriously so the fact that this was a

339
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,220
 genre comedy that was taken seriously was really pleasing

340
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,340
 and I think stands in opposition to the good place

341
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,020
 which is another genre comedy that was taken seriously but has a very different

342
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,940
 feel in terms of its optimism to russian doll and so I'm really happy

343
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,700
 that russian doll is on the roster and I think it's one of the two

344
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,420
 that I would be the happiest to see win and what is the other one john

345
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:11,220
 the other one I would be happy to see win is us directed by Jordan Peele

346
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,980
 I have not seen us but I do want to and I suspect it's quite good just because

347
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,460
 everything Jordan Peele has ever done is good so we will not be spoiling so the

348
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,620
 allison does not have to put her fingers in her ears and shout la la la

349
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,300
 because I do not want to have to edit around that so Liz can you spoiler free

350
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,700
 discuss what you liked about us I think what might be funnier is if I did

351
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,340
 it with spoilers and elaborate hand gestures and

352
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,300
 allison had to put it on mute and just watch me you know

353
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,460
 ha ha ha mime the entire film but that would

354
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,380
 probably not be much fun for the listeners

355
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:53,780
 I will not be doing that as you can put the back in

356
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,260
 I feel that would be too boring for the listeners

357
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,180
 I think the best part about us was when the hoff turned up no um

358
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:08,500
 I liked I don't watch a lot of horror films but I did find this one to be

359
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:15,140
 scary but in a really sort of plot and character driven way if that makes sense

360
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,980
 like it felt like a slasher film but with something really deep going on

361
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,860
 under it I think that acting is fantastic I don't think it's really spoiling

362
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,540
 anything because it's in the trailer to say that there are lots of doppelgangers

363
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,060
 involved and I think all the acting of the people with their doppelgangers

364
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,180
 is amazing you can always tell who is who even if they're not speaking

365
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,540
 the acting in it is phenomenal and the direction is phenomenal

366
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:49,380
 but I also think it is creepy in a way that I find most horror movies are not

367
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,660
 but I think both us and get out are incredibly creepy movies that made me

368
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,060
 feel really uncomfortable in a really nice way that's gonna sound weird but

369
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,300
 like I enjoyed the feeling of uncomfortable I had while I was watching them

370
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,580
 they really got under my skin and I really enjoyed them I think us is

371
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,860
 really really great and I think you can see that Jordan Peele's background in

372
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,820
 comedy is helping a lot with his ability to do the

373
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,420
 timing I think his sense of comic timing is helping him a lot with the pacing

374
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,540
 and the way he can make you feel uncomfortable through the film

375
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,500
 I really liked it I would be very happy to see it when

376
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,900
 I would highly recommend watching it me and a spaniel bought us and get out on

377
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,780
 iTunes for 15 quid because they've got a bundle at the moment

378
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:40,740
 we thoroughly enjoyed watching us the other week

379
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,820
 so what do you feel should win based on the ones you've seen anyway

380
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,860
 of the ones I've seen I've seen I've been voting for russia doll

381
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,380
 for all the reasons about things not overstaying they're welcome and and

382
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,380
 telling a story in the right amount of space that I've seen but I mean I'm

383
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,500
 sure that us is well up there as well and I also like good omens

384
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,940
 do you want to rank them in in order Alison like as you would on your ballot

385
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,780
 of the ones I've seen I've only seen three of these haven't I she has ranked

386
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:17,060
 the three she's seen I think which are um russia doll good omens

387
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,700
 rise of Skywalker sorry I should say more clearly russia doll good omens no

388
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,620
 award rises guy fair fair what will you be

389
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,500
 ranking them liz

390
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,540
 you've put me on the spot now because I hadn't thought about my lower

391
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,340
 ranked choice voting I think number one is us

392
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,500
 and probably russian doll I'm gonna have to think about it some more

393
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,660
 there's things I love about good omens and captain marvel and avengers end

394
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,500
 game but I really need to think about it some more and how much of it is

395
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,580
 are my judging avengers endgame as a film or am I judging avengers endgame off

396
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,260
 the 20th in a series of 20 films I think this is actually a really

397
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,740
 interesting question because I kind of wish

398
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,060
 that the marvel cinematic universe had been nominated as a single dramatic

399
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,020
 presentation long for like the whole thing from my end

400
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,620
 endgame because if that happened I would have ranked it one

401
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,980
 but as it is I'm gonna put russian doll then I'm gonna put us then I'm gonna put

402
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,180
 good omens then I'm gonna put captain marvel then I'm gonna put rise of sky

403
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,420
 walker and then I'm gonna put end game because I

404
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,180
 fundamentally didn't feel like endgame did a good job of wrapping up

405
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,700
 the mcu I think a lot of people liked it because it had a lot of fan service in

406
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,820
 it but I just didn't think it held together as a movie

407
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,340
 very well at all but did enjoy seeing it in the cinema

408
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,260
 and there are some really good bits I enjoyed all of them is the problem I

409
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,100
 wouldn't pay any of them below no award we may we may get on to

410
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,220
 discussions of when you would put something below no award

411
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,860
 but this is not the category where I would yes okay I'm probably being a bit harsh

412
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,380
 I just would be so sad if it if we got to virtual

413
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,180
 conzeland and they gave the hugator rise of sky walker and I do think it's a

414
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,660
 very significant risk because I think there are a lot of people at the

415
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,780
 wilcon who've been watching star wars movies for

416
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,700
 40 years and would like to see an award for that I think that's a good point

417
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,780
 because I think if star wars and endgame are going to get ranked on

418
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,860
 the entirety of the sagas they belong to instead of as individual works it

419
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,620
 becomes much harder to predict what the fandom is going to give the hugo to

420
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,620
 so I think if people don't do that it will go to either russian dollar

421
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,180
 us I think if they do do that then endgame's got a really good chance of

422
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,740
 winning it's my thought although good omen's has a

423
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,260
 lot of fans so maybe i'm wrong maybe good omens could steal it

424
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,180
 I wouldn't want a bit money oh good omens really does have a lot of

425
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,340
 fans it really does okay so we were going to discuss best

426
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,540
 dramatic presentation short form but it turns out we had a lot of thoughts

427
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,780
 and so we're going to leave that for a future episode

428
00:32:53,780 --> 00:33:00,100
 do we want to touch on staying sane in the apocalypse

429
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,300
 my method of staying sane in the apocalypse is having discussions with

430
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,380
 youtube about the minutiae of disney based marketing schedules

431
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,940
 how are you both coping? covid 19

432
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,540
 i do find that making sure that i'm having chats with my friends and not only that

433
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,940
 that i'm making sure that those chats go in different directions so that i'm

434
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,140
 talking to different friends about different things on different

435
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,060
 occasions is really important for me and that i do set up

436
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,100
 zoom chats where unexpected people are talking to each other because i think

437
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,220
 you get if you're always talking to the same people

438
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,220
 even if you frame it around a board game or a quiz night or whatever

439
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,700
 you would inevitably get to the point where somebody goes

440
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,900
 have you ever have you been anywhere nice recently and the other person goes

441
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,340
 well i went for a nice walk in bluebell woods at castle barnard

442
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,700
 and then you realize there's only so much you can say about walking in bluebell

443
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,140
 woods it's not true but you actually run out very

444
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,100
 quickly of things to talk about even though we've all been watching things

445
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,820
 and doing things whereas if you actually get some different people

446
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,820
 together you can actually start to have the

447
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,420
 meaty conversations about you know everything else in the world

448
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,620
 because people from different countries and people in

449
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,140
 different situations do have different experiences and they're good

450
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,580
 i think i've been doing much the same have you been

451
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,220
 talking to a plethora of people liz i mean i have but that's because i also

452
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,540
 went out and had socially distanced outdoor coffee with some people yesterday

453
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,060
 because we are on a much freer schedule i think

454
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,140
 then you guys are at this point caroline came around and had a coffee at my

455
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,300
 house and i did not think we had broken any rules but it

456
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,820
 turns out that we did she came to my house and put six

457
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:47,060
 georgettea novels on my doorstep whilst in the process of doing other

458
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,300
 errands which are legal and then she went and sat in my front garden

459
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,900
 some distance away from the house and i came out with a polypin of beer which

460
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,980
 i was selling her and put it on my recycling bin and then we

461
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,220
 had a cup of coffee together um at about three meters apart which i

462
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,260
 thought was completely legal and fine now but it turns out

463
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,980
 we needed to actually walk into the street because you could only do it at

464
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,660
 this in an outdoor public place so if we'd had done exactly the same thing but

465
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,180
 i'd start off by putting two chairs in the middle of the road

466
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,180
 we'd have been good fair enough but as it was it was legal it was a great

467
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,620
 fun though i've got to the stage where every time you see another human being

468
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,620
 you're like oh this is amazing it's a person we can drink coffee we can

469
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:33,460
 have a conversation yeah we we have in our garden we have a fence which is

470
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,740
 short enough that if we sit in the middle of our garden

471
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,540
 and our neighbors sit in the middle of their garden

472
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,020
 we can shout at each other while having lunch

473
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,380
 and that is quite good for conversation it does it does need you to shout you

474
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,340
 can't talk normally but it works quite well actually

475
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,220
 we're probably about three or four meters apart i would say

476
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,220
 but yeah it's not bad and then i've also been having

477
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,140
 Spanish lessons from my sister-in-law which has been fun

478
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,780
 keeps you occupied and i really really hate talking in Spanish not because i

479
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,620
 don't like Spanish but because as listeners will have noted i talk

480
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:14,100
 quite a lot and talking and being unable to say the thing you want to say

481
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,060
 because you don't know how to is a very frustrating thing

482
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,100
 i think if you talk a lot i'm finding it really difficult but i am

483
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,300
 persevering and it is quite good so far this is why

484
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,660
 extroverts struggle with language learning because you know you have all

485
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,220
 these things to say and it's incredibly hard to say them

486
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,260
 and then you do language learning and i've got to the stage where i can read

487
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,860
 quite a lot of Japanese now but cannot say anything in Japanese and that's

488
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,500
 good and that's really embarrassing

489
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,020
 you're learning tai-liz i am yes i'm i'm having online language lessons and one

490
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,500
 of the problems is that it can sometimes be quite hard to hear

491
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,260
 and one of the key things that we are supposed to be learning right now

492
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,020
 is how to read the different tones from the different combinations of

493
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,820
 consonants of vowels and so what it actually needs to

494
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,820
 is me saying something and then doing a hand motion to prove that i do know

495
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,420
 what tone it's supposed to be in even if it's not possible to hear over zoom

496
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,180
 exactly what tone i'm using so there's a lot of like hands going up and hands

497
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,700
 going down and hands representing rising and falling tones

498
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,580
 it's quite funny excellent and we can have a octa thought where i speak in

499
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,020
 Spanish list speaks in tai and alison is the only one anyone can understand

500
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,380
 and that will be fun absolutely because you do need my hand

501
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,140
 just to tell what tone i'm supposed to be attempting

502
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,100
 i can embed pictures if you're doing them in the podcast art so i don't know

503
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,140
 whether listeners have picked up on this but i put

504
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,140
 i put pictures in the podcast so if you're looking at your podcast player

505
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,980
 when a certain part of the podcast plays their picture will change sometimes

506
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,900
 you know if there's a relevant picture to the

507
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,100
 discussion and i could i could do second long chapters with liz

508
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,260
 gesturing to indicate where her tone should be and that would be

509
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,580
 a delightfully hacky way of solving the problem i think

510
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,860
 thank you everyone for listening to the sixth episode of the octa thought

511
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,900

 you

520
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:58,580
 okay so i think one of the really interesting things about the mcu is that

521
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,620
 they're doing this kind of two or three movie a year

522
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,980
 product where they're doing um movies which are in some ways very similar to

523
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,020
 each other and then occasionally there's a movie which is quite different

524
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,220
 like for instance the first card is the galaxy felt quite different or

525
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,300
 the ant man films feel quite different but then other films feel quite similar

526
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,740
 um and one of the really interesting things is that they did try that with

527
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,580
 star wars they released solo which was an attempt to

528
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,860
 do a heist movie that felt different from the saga

529
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:33,060
 and it was relatively poorly received by the fandom and and financially

530
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:38,260
 and i think they have have almost decided to retreat from doing

531
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,420
 um a lot of movies into the realm of tv so they've announced

532
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,580
 um they're doing the obi wan Kenobi tv series they're doing the mandelorian

533
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,260
 and they've brought the clone wars back um i'm sure they've announced something

534
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,540
 else that i'm forgetting um but a lot of what they're doing is star wars seems

535
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,820
 to be more on the television slash book slash comic side

536
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,460
 and they seem to be really hesitant to try and make a star wars

537
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,820
 cinematic universe and i think it's really interesting

538
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,740
 the way that marvel has been able to tell this multi-movie story

539
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,540
 but when star wars tried something similar i think it was quite poorly

540
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,060
 received and i am wondering how that's going to impact

541
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,460
 Lucasfilm and marvel's decisions going forward from here because

542
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,140
 for whatever reason i think they're in quite different situations with

543
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,380
 regards to their fan bases and i'm not entirely sure why

544
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,900
 well i i think part of that is that basically the film landscape is just too

545
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,860
 crowded for disney right now because they have

546
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,060
 marvel films they have star wars films they have

547
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,700
 Pixar they have disney animation they have their live action remakes of disney

548
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,140
 animation and they're in a position where if they're not careful they will

549
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,500
 start cannibalizing their own audience but in a way i think it's also just that

550
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:59,380
 solo was highly anticipated and not that great i think i would also cite

551
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,860
 rogue one here which is also a chance to tell a different sort of story

552
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,700
 in the star wars cinematic universe and i think which worked

553
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,100
 completely on its own terms and was great

554
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,020
 um so you know i think there is still there is more they can do here

555
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,300
 i think i think i will push back a little bit on solo being hotly

556
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,540
 anticipated i i i quite you may surprise you to learn

557
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,580
 i followed quite a few people who have fans of star wars on the twitters

558
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,740
 um but i didn't see a lot of excitement for solo

559
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,620
 and a lot of people i follow were very skeptical

560
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,420
 that it was a story that needed to be told and i think

561
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,540
 part of the problem with solo is that it was a prequel

562
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,300
 and i think star wars fans are very skeptical of prequels

563
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:48,260
 um i can't think why um but and i think one of the really interesting things

564
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:53,140
 as well was that because it came out five months after the last jedi

565
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,660
 the last jedi had only been out of cinemas for about six weeks when solo

566
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,860
 was in cinemas i just wonder whether they should have pushed it back to

567
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,820
 there because because they had been trying to release all of these movies

568
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,380
 at summer and they had all been pushed back to christmas

569
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,500
 and solo was the first one of the new disney era

570
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,020
 where they managed to release it on time but i actually think releasing on time

571
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,980
 was a huge mistake because it meant you didn't have enough time to build up

572
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,740
 that anticipation in between the last jedi and solo

573
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,780
 um it felt like the last jedi had only just come out really

574
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,860
 um and so i think i think there were a large number of missteps made

575
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,220
 and i but and i agree that i think and i don't know whether i'm right

576
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,260
 i think the reaction to solo was much more because

577
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,540
 of the lack of marketing and the lack of thought about when to release it

578
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,580
 than it was about the quality of the movie because i think

579
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,140
 quality is almost irrelevant when it comes to blockbusters

580
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,180
 and that's not just Star Wars it's like there's a very pessimistic view of all

581
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,620
 movies yeah they had a very serious not Harrison Ford

582
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,460
 problem too i watched the Star Wars movies when i was very young in like the

583
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,220
 90s and i am not as attached to Harrison Ford as my parents are

584
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,020
 who were very appalled that Harrison Ford was not in it

585
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,220
 um but i do wonder whether that's the other part it's like a film

586
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,700
 that's designed to appeal to original trilogy fans but it's a film that

587
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,580
 treads on the old trilogy's toes in some ways um Liz did you have any

588
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:19,620
 i do have several things can i say the several things i was going to say

589
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:24,100
 yes say the several things so one thing i would push back on that is

590
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,620
 Marvel released Captain Marvel and Avengers Endgame

591
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,860
 two months apart um so i don't think there's a reason you can't release

592
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,740
 these things in quick succession if you think the

593
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,540
 you know obviously there is an audience there for some of them i mean

594
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,700
 Avengers Endgame is kind of a special case but it didn't seem to hurt Captain

595
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,580
 Marvel people were not staying away thinking oh i'll go and see the next one

596
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:50,420
 or i've just seen one um and my main issue with solo is i don't

597
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,860
 think old and error right does a particularly great job and i just found

598
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,380
 it to be not that entertaining to be honest

599
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,300
 so just to push back on that solo has a higher tomato meter score than rise of

600
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,420
 Skywalker and a higher audience score than last Jedi

601
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,460
 so if we're going to say it's about the quality of the movies i would have thought

602
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,820
 i either rise of Skywalker or last Jedi should have been much worse

603
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:15,460
 in terms of box office and solo i am and i appreciate

604
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,260
 that the Marvel movies have been much closer together

605
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:23,540
 and i don't know why i think the Marvel movies don't have this problem

606
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,260
 but i definitely feel like there was a large reaction in the Star Wars fandom

607
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,220
 which was we don't need this movie and a large a large lack of anticipation

608
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,260
 in a way that there isn't for Marvel and so i agree on the face of it

609
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,060
 i think it seems like you should be able to release solo five months after

610
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,820
 last Jedi it should be fine but i am i'm just deeply

611
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,380
 unconvinced that i think it was anything to do with the quality of the movie

612
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,980
 because like i say in some ways solo was better received than episode eight and

613
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,580
 episode nine and it and it did far worse in the box office

614
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,860
 like far worse i miss what you were saying about last Jedi were you saying

615
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,500
 about is what were you run rate rating lost Jedi by

616
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:08,900
 so if you look at the last Jedi um like audience reviews last Jedi got 90

617
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,060
 percent from critics and got like 40 percent from the audience

618
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,460
 uh riser skywalker got about 40 percent from critics and about 90 percent

619
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,340
 from the audience if i recall correctly or it might have been lower on the

620
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,860
 audience side and then solo got about 70 percent on both

621
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,980
 and so if solo is worse and that's why it did worse

622
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,100
 then either last Jedi or riser skywalker should have done even worse

623
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,540
 and the fact they didn't i think is difficult to explain

624
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,980
 i think there is a quality based explanation which is that marvel at this

625
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,900
 point is an extremely solid reliable brand and they very rarely

626
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,060
 drop films people feel at duds so people are now

627
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,580
 reassured that if they go and see a marvel film it will probably meet

628
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,060
 at least a particular uh high watermark and probably go higher

629
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,660
 i don't think people are convinced of that for star wars films yet

630
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,780
 and i think there's also the obvious problem with looking at the last Jedi's

631
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,300
 audience rankings in that we know the last Jedi

632
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,900
 is really not liked in a particular subset of fandom who are probably more

633
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,220
 likely to have gone and written reviews of it

634
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,300
 we may be going too far into star wars versus marvel

635
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,860
 and we do have one tiny more thing to say about marvel

636
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:22,260
 yeah which is that one of the reasons i think that

637
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,700
 marvel the whole marvel cinematic universe with all its

638
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:33,140
 entrails and tendrils is accepted and even loved for that

639
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,580
 by its audience is that it's actually coming from

640
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,780
 a source which is its comics which because

641
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:45,220
 Than Lee invented the system of getting people to buy more product

642
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,860
 in comics by having all of these crossovers this is what this is it's

643
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,940
 always been doing this it is the thing that is unique about marvel

644
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,940
 and so to some extent they have just encapsulated

645
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,460
 the marvel unique selling point which is they don't just sell you stuff they sell

646
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,580
 you a very large amount of stuff and you like it

647
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,700
 that's actually that's actually a really good point i think um

648
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,780
 i think the fact that marvel has source material that is tried and tested may

649
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,980
 also massively help um and it's very but i think i didn't

650
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,020
 sorry i didn't intend to derail this into the discussion it's become

651
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:26,100
 but i just i'm not i'm not sure i'm right but i'm not sure

652
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,580
 it's obvious why star wars can't sustain the same level of movie releases as

653
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,940
 marvel and it could just be that solo was empirically bad

654
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,540
 but i am skeptical that's the whole story but i don't know

655
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:42,580
 um and so that was all i was trying to um and so that was welcome to octa thought

656
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:47,300
 where this week in the absence of new news from science fiction and fandom

657
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,900
 we are having a two-hour animated discussion of star wars versus marvel

658
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:59,220
 it's definitely on topic guys i think you're correct i don't think it

659
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,260
 that solo is it's not a bad film i just didn't

660
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,780
 enjoy it that much but i think had solo it turned out to be

661
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,780
 a really really good film like a guardians of the galaxy

662
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,460
 level of quality or something like that then people might have gone ah they can

663
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:17,380
 make good films that are entertaining in between the

664
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,860
 the big trilogy films oh i was not expecting a close reading of

665
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:26,820
 the marvel of marvel v stores that was not where i thought this was going

666
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,900
 not sure it was that closer reading ha ha oh fighting talk let's fight and

667
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,140
 talk

668
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:43,220
 jonnie you know to definitely like screen sharing with us deliberately

669
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:49,380
 yes look at this graph oh i see okay this is the lockdown spike in

670
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:53,300
 dex published per month on tv.com which i thought was interesting

671
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:01,220
 because it just rockets what's the graph oh yes i've been you know how people say

672
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,260
 you should not extrapolate from your personal experience

673
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:09,780
 to to the world in general i've been extrapolating from the things my

674
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,940
 um facebook friends talk about i have a fairly diverse large

675
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,260
 i mean they're all middle class obviously but i have a fairly diverse large

676
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,420
 group of facebook friends and i've been extrapolating like mad from my facebook

677
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,380
 friends what they've been doing and it seems to work out and i have now noticed

678
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,740
 that it also works on gaming i think people are gaming about three times as

679
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,580
 much as they did before lockdown i guess but

680
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,500
 the thing you have to bear in mind alison is that i am responsible for

681
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,180
 how many alcom horodex have you made jonner how many of those that spike is

682
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,540
 just you coming up with alcom horodex uh actually no so okay so that is

683
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:50,180
 actually a very good question i will count it is not a trivial question

684
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:56,900
 shall we finish the podcast and then and then get onto the more fun like

685
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:03,220
 post podcast fit yeah 13 oh that's just you is it

686
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:09,380
 oh sorry sorry i had not gathered jon is responsible for the global

687
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,260
 spike in ocarom horodex probably

688
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:19,940
 the after show how many so yes so three times as much gaming i reckon and that's

689
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:25,540
 based on how many of my half stone friends are online at any given time

690
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:30,660
