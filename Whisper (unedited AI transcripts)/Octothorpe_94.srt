00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 The episode title is going to be satisfying meat, and this makes me extraordinarily happy.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:26,560
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 94th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,000
 science fiction and science fiction fandom. This episode is coming to you on the 12th of October

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 2023, I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. And today we are going to discuss

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,560
 what we voted for in the best novel category in the Hugo's. And when we say what we voted for,

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,960
 I haven't decided what to vote for yet, I will decide what to vote for following this discussion,

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,840
 because you may demonstrate to me that novels I have hidden depths that I had not previously

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,960
 noticed. We're going to kick off at the start, so we're going to read down the best novel category

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,880
 with one exception. So we're going to start with The Daughter of Dr. Morro by Sylvia Morano-Gassia,

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:19,520
 which was published by Del Rey. So this is a book about a house in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico,

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,240
 and it's kind of in conversation with a book by H.G. Wells, which is called The Island of Dr.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,200
 Morro. It kind of focuses on the daughter of Dr. Morro, the titular daughter of Dr. Morro, and

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:42,160
 one of the people who work in the house for the doctor. So yeah, Colotta and Montgomery.

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,720
 And that is kind of a potted summary of the book. What do we think? First off, are we going to

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,520
 do spoilers? No spoilers? Oh, we're definitely doing spoilers. Second, I think that was a good

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,160
 job, but I don't think you actually basically said anything about what is in the book. So

17
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,200
 we might want to see if we can do like very pithy 30-second introverts to the other ones.

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,640
 Okay, what did I miss out on? Well, just because you didn't mention anything about it,

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:15,280
 meaning of the hybrid man animal people. I just keep it. Yeah, so critically, Dr. Morro is uplifting

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,840
 animals to pick a term from David Brim, but he was doing it in his in their Wells novel as well.

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,080
 It's patching in some of the things that are just left in the Wells as you didn't need to explain

22
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,520
 this sort of stuff when you were writing an adventure novel in the 1890s, but maybe you do

23
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,280
 need to do that now. So things like where the money is coming from, and the money is coming from

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,880
 somebody who believes that uplifted animals might be a good labor force. So obviously, you're then

25
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:52,160
 getting into some very interesting ideas about slavery and colonialism and my general critical

26
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,320
 click, which is how is the work getting done. And this book kind of sets some of this stuff up and

27
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,480
 then really doesn't answer it as much as I would expect. And it's not a particularly long book,

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:10,400
 and it quite spends quite a lot of the book engaged in the daughter's love triangle, which I have to

29
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,800
 say is one of the most boring love triangles I have ever read in all of my time reading fiction.

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,400
 Because there are two men here and they're both terrible. So, you know, but the big problem I

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,880
 have with this book is that if you are familiar with Wells and familiar about it, then there is

32
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,840
 a major reveal about 80% of the way through the book. And if you're remotely familiar with the

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,960
 Wells, then reading the title might tell you what that reveal is. So this is a problem.

34
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,200
 Yeah, I would say when you decided to read the Wells, I thought you were making a mistake,

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
 and I did wonder whether that would come up in our discussion.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,760
 Yeah, I think you should have read the Wells four years ago. That would be a good time to

37
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,480
 have read it, or when you were a child, something like that.

38
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,680
 I don't think you're supposed to not work the twist out, I will say. I think it's like not clear

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,320
 to the character, and I think it's believably done that the character that is not clear to the

40
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,920
 character. But I don't think you're supposed to be like absolutely astounded by the reveal.

41
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,560
 I really liked this. I liked the character work. I think the way I described the book at the

42
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,320
 beginning really neatly encapsulates the bits I found interesting about it. The hybrids are

43
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,520
 kind of interesting, but it is not the plot that appealed to me about this one. It's like their

44
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,080
 comment trees on colonialism, capitalism, and the way it blends all that together with stuff

45
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,080
 about Mexico, which I was kind of like unaware of. It feels like exactly the sort of novel I think

46
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,080
 the Hugo's very good at recognizing in their late stage where it's someone from a different

47
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,480
 background exploring the genre from a different set of eyes and having different takes on what's

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:51,040
 going on. I liked it for that. Yeah, I think the setting is really interesting, and it's very

49
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,920
 complex in how it interrogates it. So it's not kind of a setting where the Europeans bad

50
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,920
 the indigenous people's good. There are different aspects to it because there are

51
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,560
 kind of the indigenous my own people, but also other people from other areas like South America.

52
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,320
 And also one of the lead characters is a British guy who's basically outrunning his pastel trying

53
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,880
 to by being in Mexico and around there. But it's not really, it's kind of a more interesting than

54
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,160
 just this guy is a colonialist, but obviously he has some kind of privileges and power based on

55
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,120
 who he is, but also not because he's heavily indebted to other people. So I thought that was

56
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,160
 interesting. The love triangle is maybe a little bit, it's not the most interesting bit, but I kind

57
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:46,480
 of liked Calotta the daughter because she's not quite been raised in solitude and completely taken

58
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:54,240
 in by the you know, shiny young man who appears and she's not unaware of kind of the wider issues,

59
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,120
 but he's still someone who's trying to figure out like what would be best for her and still can get

60
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,680
 kind of seduced and taken in. So I thought it was a bit more complicated than maybe your average

61
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,400
 love triangle between the young women and the two men who are interested in it. Plus she does

62
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,280
 kind of at the end is not really with either of them. She is off making her own way.

63
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,880
 Yeah, I did like that as the ending of the situation.

64
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,880
 Calotta has two hybrid companions who are hybrids who are kind of not quite perfect hybrids,

65
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,400
 but they are very interesting characters and I thought they were very well drawn and they

66
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,360
 are better drawn than any of Wells' hybrid characters. And the other, I thought this

67
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,560
 because it's not just, it's in dialogue with the Wells obviously, but it also has quite a lot to

68
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,880
 say, but it's quite like the Tempest with the magician and his daughter and their spirits

69
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,960
 on an island and it is also quite like Blade Runner with a madman who is building a working

70
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,960
 class and who has a beautiful daughter. And I thought those were also two very interesting

71
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,720
 influences. This is one of the most interesting novels on the ballot. It may be the most interesting

72
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,440
 novel on the ballot. I just don't think it worked very well. I think that's a, I really liked a lot

73
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,760
 of things about it, but I feel like it didn't all pull together to leave me feeling, "Oh yes,

74
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,160
 I have read a very satisfying science fiction novel at the end of it." I read it first as well

75
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,680
 and I think I probably liked it more if I'd read it last after some of these other novels,

76
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,760
 because I think I might have been grading on the wrong curve.

77
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,840
 Yeah, it feels like it has lots of interesting components to it that don't quite make 100%

78
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,120
 satisfying novel. Also, I've read a couple of reviews of this that say, "Oh, this one's got

79
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,440
 onto the ballot, but in fact, Moreno-Gasi has written better books and she's been kind of

80
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,800
 bubbling under on the Hugo ballot for a few years." So, so it's definitely worth, I haven't read

81
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,840
 anything else by her and I'm definitely going to go away and do that now because I thought this was

82
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,880
 very interesting. She'd been on my radar for a while, so I want to read Mexican Gothic, but the one

83
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,000
 I'm particularly interested in is she wrote the daughter of Cthulhu, or she edited the daughter

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,640
 of Cthulhu anthology, which obviously is in my wheelhouse. So, I, you know, I think I agree,

85
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,840
 I don't think this comes together quite as well as I think it might have done, but I did,

86
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,920
 there were, I thought there was a lot to like in it. And then next up is The Kaidu Preservation

87
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:17,040
 Society by John Scalzi, published by Tor Books. This is a book in which a delivery driver makes

88
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,760
 friends with someone because he makes deliveries to him and it turns out that person works for an

89
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,440
 organisation that because of nuclear power plants thinning the boundaries between worlds,

90
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,560
 works for an ecological preservation society dedicated to Kaidu on a parallel earth.

91
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,320
 Hijinks ensue. "Kaidu are Japanese movie monsters, which you probably need to know before you

92
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,920
 read this novel because if you don't, they never really describe the Kaidu at all in more than the

93
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:52,480
 most basic forms. So, you have to make them in your mind." "I feel like Kaidu is a term of art

94
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,160
 similar to zombies where like you don't have to go into massive detail on zombies either because

95
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,480
 everyone knows what a zombie is. Do we think that's wrong?" "I think more people know what a zombie

96
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,160
 is than know what a Kaidu is, but two things are left undescribed in this novel and I think it's

97
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,120
 quite deliberate. The first is the main character and the second is the Kaidu and I think that's

98
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,760
 that's one of the things that is interesting about the novel kind of as a structural thing."

99
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,600
 "Scalzy has been fascinated by main characters that go undescribed like was it

100
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,320
 lock-in where the main character's gender is unspecified?" "Yeah, main character's gender is

101
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
 unspecified here as well, which I didn't know until I finished reading the book either.

102
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,760
 I read this main character as male, other people read this main character as female,

103
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:44,080
 people have opinions loudly on the internet." "Hey." "I mean, I noted it because there's a few

104
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,240
 points where I noticed that everyone was referring to Jamie as Jamie where you would naturally throw

105
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,600
 in a pronoun, but only a couple of times did I realize that was happening. So I think it is quite

106
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,320
 well done, but it is also a testament to the characters in this novel who are all interchangeable

107
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,680
 millennial nerds and gender is basically unimportant because everything is unimportant,

108
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,080
 except that they're from millennial nerds." Okay, so this novel is largely the story is

109
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,920
 largely told through the medium of "baddens" which is fine, but it does get a little bit

110
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,960
 wearing, but I mean I enjoyed it. I read this very quickly, I enjoyed it a whole lot. It doesn't

111
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,320
 do a huge amount, you know. It's it's so in the way that the Marana Garcia is an extremely ambitious

112
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,800
 novel that doesn't quite pull it off. This is an extremely unambitious novel that does it perfectly.

113
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,920
 Yeah, I think that's better. I think like, and the afterward makes it clear that this is indeed

114
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,280
 explicitly the case because Scalzi was trying to write an ambitious novel in the pandemic and

115
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,800
 they eventually burned out and then this was the novel that he wrote instead. "He's like,

116
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,520
 it's a lovely light thing that will distract you from the terror of your know-all life and then

117
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,600
 you could read this and then you can just enjoy it and then get on with your life and I'm very

118
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,240
 that's fine. We need books like that, but we don't necessarily need them to put them on our

119
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,640
 awards shortlist people. What's wrong with you lot? Sorry, anyway."

120
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,120
 I think I wanted to pick up on something that Liz said, which is that all of these people are

121
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,720
 millennial nerds. This is true, but one of the things that me and España were discussing when

122
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,040
 we were both reading it was that it's not just that they're all millennial nerds, they're all

123
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,240
 incredibly like sarcastic and quippy millennial nerds and I said to her, "I wish there was one line of

124
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,320
 dialogue in this novel that didn't get appended with the word 'droyly'. I'd quite like some wet dialogue,

125
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,480
 please. Just one earnest person who doesn't get any jokes would be great because like in real life

126
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
 there are earnest people who don't get my joke because this world feels very superficial because

127
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,480
 it is entirely people who feel like they would be friends with John Scalzi, which is great, but like

128
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,960
 it didn't feel particularly plausible to me that the characterizations really

129
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,920
 told me out of the book a couple of times. One of the nice things usually if you have characters who

130
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,120
 are sarcastic quippy nerds is there's usually a moment where they stop being sarcastic quippy nerds.

131
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,680
 Like there's a moment of sincerity or otherwise that kind of then contrasts with it and it didn't

132
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,600
 feel like we had that very much. I would say I did find this novel quite funny which given that

133
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,920
 there are two novels on here which particularly seldom sells as being funny, I thought it was

134
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,760
 interesting that this novel I found funnier than either of those two novels by quite a long way

135
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,680
 because they're sarcastic quippy nerds and they do that stuff. I like quite like that stuff because

136
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,080
 I like those sorts of people so you know I really enjoyed it. I mean if you have like a couple of

137
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,440
 after hours to sit and read a funny novel and amuse yourself then yeah this is for you. It's a

138
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,200
 very short novel quite a lot of short novels on this ballot this year. It's 270 pages long. How long?

139
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:56,960
 270 pages. That's short compared to Bloody Nona. Yeah but I don't think it's a short book.

140
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,520
 I'm also not convinced that helicopters can do some of the things they do in this book

141
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,880
 and there is in fact a line where you know the helicopter does a thing and then another thing

142
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,320
 which is fine if it's because you're you know narrating this from your first person millennial

143
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,960
 perspective but it kind of covers up that I'm not sure that it would actually work but I mean

144
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,200
 that's not really the point of this novel is it? I'm not generally reading science fiction

145
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,760
 novels to nitpick the helicopter science either yeah. No but I think if you're doing kind of a

146
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,720
 sort of fun adventury novel I shouldn't be imagining like this helicopter bouncing about like Roger

147
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,080
 Rabbit or something. Have you seen the movie Mission Impossible Fallout in which Tom Cruise

148
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,440
 survives not one not two but three crashes of the same helicopter in sequence?

149
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,080
 I have not seen that. Does he survive by driving his motorbike out of any of them?

150
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,800
 I'm here. I enjoyed it. I will say coming back to the comedy thing um I find scowsy funniest when

151
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,520
 he's not explicitly writing comedy. It's like Red Chirts I found was one of his least funny books

152
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,400
 but I really laugh out loud at the Old Man's War series and this was kind of in the middle where

153
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,080
 it is clearly like I say I think he is at his funniest when he is not trying to be lighthearted

154
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,880
 in a way. Yeah I mean there are plenty of funny lines in this book and I will just come to

155
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,560
 Allison's defense so this book is 80,000 words which I do think is on the short side. It is I think

156
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,960
 because most I sort of imagine a standard novel to be a hundred and then anything below 90 I think

157
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,600
 of is quite short. Three of the books on the short list came up as about 220 pages on my

158
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,760
 kobo so roughly the same length and I think of those as short novels yeah and then the

159
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,240
 marina gossia is a bit longer and known as a lot longer and the spare man is a lot.

160
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,440
 Yeah I mean the advantage of the internet is that you can get you can get facts. Yeah so um

161
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
 daughter dot tomorrow is bang on a hundred thousand. I think that is normal novel.

162
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,280
 Spare man is 108 so I would again say that's normal novel.

163
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,920
 Nona is 170 which I would say safely is long novel. Kaiju is short novel.

164
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,440
 Nettlin bone is 82 yep so short novel and then the other one which is

165
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,920
 legends and lossays. That's the one which I assume is short because it had a short story in it

166
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,520
 and that usually means that they didn't quite make word count. Yeah 60k.

167
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,400
 That is very short. On the topic of legends and lates shall we discuss legends and lates?

168
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:39,840
 So I'm a small business owner. I'm really up for a novel about somebody setting up a small business

169
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,640
 and the trials and tribulations of doing so before you eventually get success. This doesn't

170
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,720
 have any of the tribulations and trials really apart from one kind of massive one but in general

171
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,720
 everyone in this book is nice. Every supporting character lives their life with no purpose other

172
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,320
 than to make the main characters life better which is a kind of weird way for a novel to be

173
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,320
 and um oh god and I was a huge fan of Travis Baldry before I started reading this novel so you know

174
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,200
 oh yes and it has a fantasy setting but it's not it's about a woman setting up a coffee shop could

175
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,640
 be in Seattle could be anywhere. Has no fantasy content. It couldn't be in Seattle. It does have

176
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,800
 fantasy content. No one's heard of coffee. Clearly ludicrous. Okay London in 2001 you know.

177
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:32,080
 It could it could be science fiction. There might be less organised crime in Seattle I don't know.

178
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,160
 Yeah maybe maybe not I don't know. Seattle fans writing. So this is a world in which there is no

179
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,960
 of organised government but there is organised crime. I saw a review of this book that said like

180
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,920
 Terry Pratchett without the jokes and that is completely fair without the jokes or political

181
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,880
 commentary. Yeah I don't think it's trying at all to be Terry Pratchett so like um yeah but

182
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,720
 it's said to Dan Mark Park. I don't think it is. I don't think it's trying to be said to be

183
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,280
 Dan Mark Park. It is trying to be a coffee shop AU extended to a novel. I thought it did that

184
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:10,320
 brilliantly. I am not convinced it needs to win a Hugo Award for doing that but like as a cozy book

185
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,600
 that I read in an afternoon and made me feel vaguely fuzzy I thought it smashed out the park

186
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,000
 and that is I think why people read coffee shop AU's as well. So like I think it does everything

187
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,520
 the author wanted it to do and I think the reason it is very popular. What's a coffee shop AU?

188
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,680
 Liz do you want to explain what a coffee shop AU is? Yes so Alison there is a genre of fan fiction

189
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,800
 in which you take your favourite characters from a tv show or movie or video game and basically

190
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,600
 recast them so they're all in a coffee shop and they're all baristas or maybe they're

191
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,200
 handsome delivery guy. So like friends? No because in friends they don't actually do any coffee making

192
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,600
 like I don't know I haven't actually read any of these things because generally the reason I'm

193
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,720
 watching a tv show or movie is not because I want to recast the characters in a coffee shop

194
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,440
 but I understand this is a thing. It's perfectly fair this is this is a self-published piece of

195
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,480
 fan fiction that got picked up by a publisher but so that is what it is that is perfectly

196
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,400
 fine. I don't think Baldry ever really expected to end up where he's got with this.

197
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,320
 But I will say so I think the reason it has done the reason I think it has done very well this year

198
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,640
 is because it is a cozy book about a queer person doing a thing with not many obstacles.

199
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:36,800
 I think a lot of people needed that in the political and health climate of 2022 and 2023.

200
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,040
 So I do understand why it's popular. Yeah, yeah but Bill Mills and Bird exists. I mean I

201
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,480
 like I'm not saying this is the world's best science fiction because I do not think it is. I don't

202
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,640
 think it's terrible though because I think it does exactly what it wants to do extremely well.

203
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,400
 I think that is laudable in its own way. I do not think the author was trying to do anything other

204
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,960
 than exactly what he did. I mean but it does set up some things right so it does set up that there

205
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,520
 is organized crime and they are coming around to you know get payments from the business owner for

206
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,000
 safety and security and the way this is resolved is she goes and chats ahead of crimes and they're

207
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,640
 gree she can have some cinnamon buns. Cake. You've read this as organized crime but it's

208
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,120
 actually the government. It's taxes it's somebody coming to you in in order to get payment for

209
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,200
 public services. Although generally if I don't pay my taxes I don't think they're quite as

210
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,840
 menacing people with swords who come round. Yeah I mean very enough but you know this is set up as

211
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,120
 like a major obstacle. You've clearly never had the BBC license fee people come over Liz terrifying.

212
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:49,680
 But they it's set up as a major obstacle and it becomes not an obstacle at all because they give

213
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,280
 us some cinnamon buns which they have invented. Why even bother setting it up as an obstacle if

214
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,400
 you're just going to dismiss it in five seconds and then the lady is now your best friend.

215
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,160
 Because the point of this book is for every obstacle you face to be something that can be easily

216
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,200
 overcome with application of either cake or friends because again it's trying to be a cozy

217
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,720
 A.U. coffee shop story. Like I think all of the things you are describing as bugs are features

218
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,600
 which is to say I am going to put this fifth on my ballot or probably fifth or six. I haven't

219
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,800
 decided whether I like it more or less than the kaiju book. But I think criticizing it for things

220
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,720
 that it is nailing as what it is trying to do is I just think it misses the point a bit.

221
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,360
 Well I think it's worthy of recognition if there was an award for best coffee shop A.U.

222
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,840
 we'd be right up there right? Yes it would win. It would get if there was a Hugo award for

223
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,320
 best cozy book this would smash it. Or coziest book this is very cozy book.

224
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,640
 Coziest book. Imagine I read you know if I want something that's cozy I might go and read like

225
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,400
 a romance novel because then I kind of know we're going from A to B in it's where the twists are

226
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:10,960
 along the way but even then like it doesn't necessarily have to be that you know you but I think you

227
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,080
 have to have like some way of resolving this like maybe we should resolve this by you know a

228
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,880
 non-traditional way. I'm not saying she should be paying the protection money/taxes but you know

229
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,880
 if there was at least some like small obstacle that she had to talk her way through or that was

230
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,560
 resolved by you know talking to her friends about it but it literally just seems to resolve by going

231
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:39,280
 along to this meeting and then it's all sorted right like I don't believe in the romance if this

232
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:47,680
 romance doesn't have any obstacles to it. To be fair they explain later that the the the cinnamon

233
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,760
 buns in return for protection thing is because and this is one of the ways that you know that the

234
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,200
 madrigal is actually about government not crime is she is drentrifying the area and the madrigal

235
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,960
 likes that. That's explicitly said in the book it's it's not you know so I talk a lot about

236
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,560
 critical chisels. This book doesn't really you can't really use a critical feather on it because as

237
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,760
 soon as you start thinking about anything in the novel it all falls apart like a like a like a

238
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,360
 particularly frothy cake that you might get in a coffee shop. I want I want to say I don't think

239
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,920
 I've said this loudly or maybe at all. I completely agree with everything Liz and Alison have said

240
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:29,520
 about this novel. I just think that that is the point like every single criticism I think is an

241
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,320
 entirely valid thing that is wrong with this book. I have to give my Travis Baldry shout out here

242
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,520
 which is that the reason I knew of Travis Baldry was that he took a genre of video game which is

243
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,640
 where is dungeon crawling where you go and fight horrible monsters and he made the cutest game

244
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,160
 ever made in that in that genre where you are adorable your pet is adorable most of the things

245
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,440
 you meet are adorable nothing bad ever happens to you and so I feel like the man has for me here.

246
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,160
 I do agree like it is not going to be anywhere near the top of my ballot and hopefully hopefully I

247
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,360
 mean if this was the hugo then I don't know I don't know what I'll do. Nothing probably I'll

248
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,240
 just rant about it on my podcast I have a podcast. Do that right guys? So anyway yeah I think we're

249
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,640
 agreed we disagree on exactly why we're all putting it towards the bottom of our ballot but I think

250
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,720
 I don't think any of us are putting this at the top is that fair? I mean yeah but I just I don't

251
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:30,560
 want to think that this is like cozy fantasy has to mean that you can just like make up plot hurdles

252
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,840
 and then forget them again. I would also like to point out that if this is supposed to be like

253
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,000
 oh the real the real treasure was the friends we made along the way they're all your employees.

254
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,960
 Well okay so how are union eyes?

255
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,160
 I want to read the sequel to this which is the union.

256
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,840
 She makes them partners but they're not really even employees the aspects of her

257
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,200
 they because the thing about books about found families and the books where you

258
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,440
 even employees books where you kind of work with people to achieve a goal.

259
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,920
 That's like quite like that genre. One of the reasons why like one of the reasons about a

260
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,960
 podcast is good is because we don't agree all the time. I disagree. We don't automatically do things

261
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,640
 to because they'll make John happy right? No I mean that I fully agree with.

262
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:30,000
 You know it's it's it's not that's because when you have a joint enterprise and you bring

263
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,200
 something really good together from the joint enterprise it's because you have different opinions

264
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,680
 and you work through those different opinions to build the thing that is worthwhile and there's

265
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,120
 very little of that in this book. That's the thing that really makes it fail for me is that if she

266
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,600
 was telling that sort of story if he was telling that sort of story which I do really like

267
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,960
 there's not a disagreement it's just you know everyone just loves it everyone just loves her

268
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,160
 it's just being surrounded by people who adore what she's doing.

269
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,840
 I'm running out of ways to say I completely agree with your criticism but I don't think it's

270
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,320
 what he's trying to do but yes agreed. I would not have read this book if it wasn't on the Hugo

271
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,800
 bout and I would not read other things by this author probably. I might if I was in like a really

272
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,000
 bad mood and I just wanted something to turn the pages but that's why I have Star Wars

273
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,760
 tie-in novels which achieve a very similar thing for me.

274
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,960
 This and Clergy Preservation Society both neither of them is going to trouble you very much they

275
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,400
 both get read in the after in read a bit of coffee shopping an afternoon with a coffee in a cinnamon

276
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:38,000
 bun. Oh yeah I will say one very concrete boon of this book which might elevate it to fifth on my

277
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,960
 ballot is that when it spany made it she did get back onto her cinnamon roll baking kick

278
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,200
 and that was a concrete win in this house so thank you to Travis Baldry because I got a lot of

279
00:25:49,200 --> 00:26:00,320
 cinnamon buns mmm yeah win fair fair right from a book that tries to do not a lot and is very clear

280
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,560
 and doesn't have many obstacles to no another ninth which is different different to that in many ways

281
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:16,240
 so this is the third entry in the locked tomb series this is hard to pray see but it's about

282
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:25,680
 a little girl who likes being the class monitor at her school and then has to go on a school trip

283
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:33,040
 so she's a she's a she's a late teenage girl who has very few memories and so is presenting as a

284
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,720
 very younger it's going to be tricky so okay so I've got a thought about this book which is

285
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,800
 I enjoyed Gideon the ninth very much I thought it was good I thought to be fair I thought the first

286
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,160
 half was a little bit slow but the second half I like thought was great and then I really actually

287
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,800
 enjoyed Harrow the ninth as well and I know not everyone did but like I really liked the way it

288
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,120
 kind of takes the first book and starts start start playing with the story of that book in a way

289
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,320
 that makes you wonder what's going on and then kind of resolves it at the end in a way where you're

290
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,560
 pretty sure you know what's going on but you're not 100% and I was looking forward to the third

291
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:11,120
 volume because I thought it would confirm what had happened in the second volume and instead what it

292
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,560
 does is it gets way more confusing and for me I'm keen to read the fourth volume still because I do

293
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,320
 still want to know what's going on but I do think there is merit to actually explaining what's going

294
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,800
 on I wish this book had done more to resolve what was actually going on in Harrow because at the

295
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,360
 moment I'm like the starting point of someone reading this book is going to be very divergent

296
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,600
 based on exactly how they interpreted the events of Harrow and then this book is going to make that

297
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,760
 diverge even more and so I don't think many fans in this series will be on quite the same

298
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,320
 wavelength as to what is actually going on and I think that I found frustrating in a way that I

299
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,320
 didn't for Harrow so this is my least favorite of the three so far so I would say I enjoyed like

300
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:04,960
 the first half so all the bits about Nona but it did feel like and you know I know that this book

301
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,640
 was added to make the trilogy into Quadrilla Jupy Jimmy when the last volume got too big but it does

302
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,280
 feel like she got really interested in Nona and wanted to do more about Nona and then at some point

303
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,880
 it was like oh but I have to now fit this back into the rest of the story let's go back into the

304
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:32,160
 kind of necromancery necroloid shenanigans side of things and I think it's a little it doesn't quite

305
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:39,280
 fit together and I wonder if I would have just preferred like the bits that are known as this

306
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,600
 completely separate book but maybe I need that kind of tension about who Nona actually is to make it

307
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,240
 work I did enjoy it I had to go back and look up who half the characters were at the start even though

308
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,480
 I had literally read Harrow the ninth the week before it does not even a tiny it's bit of hand

309
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,880
 holding it's like do you remember that character who was actually two characters in one and like in

310
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,560
 the last 10 pages they changed their name well now they're a main character hope you remembered

311
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:12,400
 who they were and it also has flashbacks although I don't really know when the flashbacks are

312
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:19,520
 happening but anyway sort of retelling the story of the god emperor of this world who essentially

313
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,840
 comes from our world and I'm not sure it that fits in um I was necessary to know kind of how it

314
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,920
 came about I'd already got the idea from Harrow that he was not a great guy to be the god emperor

315
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,200
 but I still enjoyed it because I enjoy everything with like necromancers and ridiculous swordplay

316
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,960
 and bone magic and you know people being in different bodies and going into the mysterious

317
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,400
 river and living there and coming back out and and so I quite enjoyed it but I also don't really

318
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,400
 know what happens at the end yes all of what Liz said I agree with I have a general complaint

319
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,280
 about series which is that I don't like books where I feel I'm reading the same book over and over

320
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,720
 again which I often do with series even ones that are very well thought of um the locked tomb

321
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:13,680
 doesn't give me that problem okay no that is fair except that structurally it does because I feel

322
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,320
 like it's now set up for we basically have a novel where for three quarters of the novel you

323
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,560
 have not the faitus fucking idea what's going on and then about fairly close to the end there's

324
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,240
 there is a large info dump after which many things become clear and and then about 80% of

325
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,920
 everything gets resolved but like the last 20% hopefully she can pull it together on the fourth

326
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:37,040
 book but I am now getting a little bit tired of that structure I also think this book is

327
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,920
 far too long for the story it's telling the stuff the bits with Noda was perfectly fine

328
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,240
 just go on and on and on and on and we know that in fact not that much of that bill is going to

329
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,720
 lead into our eventual plot and there's also some of the stuff later in the novel some of the

330
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,680
 flashbacks are longer than they need to be there's quite a lot that just feels flabby in this book

331
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:01,520
 but you're telling a really complicated story deflapping it makes it easier to tell the

332
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,440
 the long and complicated story not not harder so I like this one I like Gideon and maybe like

333
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,520
 Harold even more than Gideon and I like this one slightly less than all three of them but my

334
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,160
 this comes to my other big problem with this book for the best level category which is guys this

335
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,320
 is a do-novel this isn't what a novel looks like this is not it anyway it does not have any of

336
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,840
 the features of a novel if you looked at it with critical theory you would go oh no that's not

337
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,760
 what the novel is yeah it's a it's the third part of a four-part book and it's it should not be on

338
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,080
 the best kind of a category and it's an absolute scandal that it is I mean obviously it satisfies

339
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,120
 because it's like fiction of more than 40,000 words but it is just like a chunk of fiction out of the

340
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,000
 middle of a of a series and series is why we have this best series category and it could go there

341
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,240
 and like a bird fruit there which I probably will do because I really like I am curious like

342
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,880
 I think it's more of a jam it's more of a jam than a novel yeah like maybe a strawberry jam why

343
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,880
 it's not it doesn't it so so a novel tells a story this doesn't tell a story if you pick this up

344
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,320
 without having read the previous two books in the series it would make no sense at all this is

345
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,160
 basically me saying it's clearly a novel uh it does it does I actually I would actually sincerely

346
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,680
 argue that it would make almost as much sense as it does having read the previous two because it's

347
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,840
 not like the previous two had a lot of clues readers if if any of you out there have read Noda but

348
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,440
 hadn't read the previous two because it's all the Hugo Ballot please write it with your thoughts

349
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,040
 does this feel like a level to you I mean I think you could argue it it tells the story of Nona even

350
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,360
 if you don't really know what's going on with the rest of the characters that Nona has a sort of

351
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,520
 satisfying character arc except I don't really know what happens to her at the end but otherwise

352
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,520
 Nona I don't think she does does she well I think she has I don't think she has a happy ending but

353
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:57,440
 I think she has a satisfying character arc we meet her at her birth and then spoilers we leave her

354
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,600
 at her death and we encounter her entire life in between so I would actually argue quite strongly

355
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,560
 that this is a complete story I might have been more sympathetic to your point with Harrow um but

356
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:14,480
 this one feels much more self-contained than I think Harrow did and I suspect Alexa will again

357
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,680
 feel much less self-contained but this one didn't and that's actually why I don't like it because I

358
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,320
 I think that's my main problem with it is that it feels like a self-contained story being told in

359
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,520
 between like bits of a story I would quite like carry on with like this does not appear to advance

360
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:37,200
 the series in any meaningful way to me so actually I actually almost diametrically disagree with

361
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,280
 you on that I want to come back to the um uh point I think Liz made which is this is a book that would

362
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:49,040
 greatly benefit from a proper dramatic personi and the guest list was the most annoying thing

363
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,960
 about the novel because it's very cute but I would actually like to know what the fuck is going on

364
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,720
 and who all these people are like and that was the other thing which is I did because I have read

365
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,560
 Harrow a year ago two years ago a year ago I can't remember now but a while ago I do not remember

366
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,880
 the finer details of Harrow in a way that would mean I could pick up anything from the series the

367
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:17,920
 wider series I've got no idea who thingamajig is hecked I vaguely remember her coming up in a

368
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:25,760
 previous book but like yeah so that's that is Camilla one of the original cavaliers from Gideon

369
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:33,840
 the ninth she was in Gideon yeah okay and yes I'd be I'm on and look up now how long it was since

370
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,960
 I read the previous installment yeah so I did just read them so maybe it just follows on much more

371
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,920
 for me because I've done that and it holds its own as a novel much better but again I think the

372
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:51,200
 pacing is really off for a novel oh yeah I agree like I think I think structurally is a mess

373
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:58,320
 maybe that's unfair but like it and like I'm not I'm not a critic and I'm not a published author so

374
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,080
 maybe this is incredibly unfair of me but it feels much less well constructed than the previous two

375
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:11,040
 did to me I mean with the outside knowledge I suspect this was like act one of Alecto the ninth

376
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,400
 and the point that we get to at the end which spoiler I think is like Alecto is released and

377
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,840
 Harrow's soul goes back into no no but I'm not entirely sure like I presume that's where we're

378
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,000
 supposed to get to part of the way through the fourth book to set up the ending and now we'll get

379
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,240
 that ending all plot all the time hopefully I am slightly worried that the end book's going to be

380
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,480
 more than 200,000 words so that it satisfies the requirements for best series next time please don't

381
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,040
 do that this book is too long I mean it really is too long there were multiple times while reading

382
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,880
 it that I was like oh no this book is easy to put down and hard to pick up again and you know I had

383
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,800
 to go off and read one of the other novels and then come back to it because it's got to be two new

384
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,640
 works to be eligible and best series again by the way so one very long book won't do it oh thank you

385
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,240
 thank you oh oh I guess I'm getting interested in best series now in a way that I maybe didn't

386
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,040
 before I started reading a lot more books so that's quite good yeah and apparently so I just

387
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:21,200
 checked and I read Harrow in February 2021 so it's been like two and a half years and I'm like oh yeah I

388
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,400
 also think when we were saying on the best editor and we don't know what editors do we kind of do

389
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,880
 know what editors do because the job of editors is to say oh yeah no this is great but this section

390
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,280
 in the middle feels like there's some pacing issues what can we do about that and and and I feel like

391
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,240
 this is a very successful series and the more successful people get the less editors are inclined

392
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,880
 to mess with the thing that they think works so I feel that somebody should have said there's a

393
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,240
 great 120,000 word novel in there let's find it because I think that probably it I think if I had

394
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:01,040
 one criticism of the series as a whole it would be that I do think each of the books are a bit

395
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,440
 longer than they really need to be it's a mean embarrassing long time to work out that no-no

396
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:13,840
 was was um Harrow and Gideon I mean like 20 pages but still shall we do the next one the spare man

397
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:24,080
 by Mary Robinec Co-Hull this is a story about a wealthy heiress whose spouse is accused of murder

398
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:30,880
 and who takes it upon herself to try and demonstrate that their spouse is not in fact a murderer

399
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,720
 also the heiress is chronically ill or has chronic pain sorry and she has a very cute dog

400
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,680
 yeah so so this is also a book in dialogue this time with a movie called The Thin Man um unlike

401
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,680
 the Wells where unlike you probably should have read us a while ago I recommend not watching

402
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,080
 The Thin Man before you read this novel because um because it didn't help at all because The Thin

403
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:02,000
 Man is a very funny movie and this is a relentlessly unfunny novel you know this is the novel I found

404
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,560
 least funny of the six on the short list by a mile and considering this it's supposed to be a

405
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,920
 humorous novel that's a problem I mean there aren't very many jokes and they don't land very well

406
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,160
 and they are mostly instead of coming out of wit and people doing witty things they're kind of set

407
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,400
 up as I'm gonna tell a joke now and sometimes they go oh this person said something funny let's talk

408
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,240
 for a few paragraphs about how funny the thing they just said was and I'm like well it wasn't

409
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,200
 particularly it was just like ordinary an ordinary conversational aside this is not funny this is

410
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,600
 the the oh I just read it to the thought Mary Robinette Cowell lovely lovely person she is must be

411
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:43,120
 terribly unfunny I think you are laboring from a misapprehension because I do not think this is

412
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,600
 supposed to be funny like the cover does not mention that it's supposed to be funny none of the tags on

413
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,880
 goodreads mention being funny the blurb does not mention being funny I don't think this is intended

414
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,440
 to be a comedy as I am reluctant to ding it on the basis it isn't one I think it's just supposed

415
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,320
 to be a mystery I like hide mystery but I don't think it's supposed to be a comedy mystery I mean

416
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,400
 I don't find any of the books on this short list for me anyway but I think it's supposed to have like

417
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:19,440
 a light frothy kind of you know newlyweds sparring tone that I don't think it really gets very well

418
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,520
 yeah yeah I think it's supposed to be bands I think the scowlsy book definitely has bands this one

419
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,160
 does not particularly have that oh I should know I should know I did have um it's time for a

420
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,320
 Españez opinion da da da da dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dingle so

421
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:43,040
 Españez found uh no the ninth incredibly frustrated frustrating and really didn't like it uh the

422
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,440
 spare man she thought was awful um and the reason she thought it was awful and I suspect Alison will

423
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,880
 agree with this take is that she was like I don't understand why this is science fiction this could

424
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:00,400
 have just happened on a cruise ship and I think that is my core I enjoyed it I enjoyed some of the

425
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,520
 like world building and I enjoyed some of the things that happened and I thought it was a nice quick

426
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,160
 read but I agree with her that I don't think it's a particularly science fictional book and like

427
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,120
 I don't think it does anything particularly noteworthy and so like it will probably be towards the

428
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,880
 bottom of my ballot because even though I did enjoy the process of reading it I'm not sure it

429
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,400
 like excited me in a sort of I'm going to put this on a Hugo ballot kind of a way we should say I

430
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,640
 enjoyed it better than the scallowsy and the Baldry but like I definitely think it's less

431
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,680
 interesting than the other three um I think there's the and then you might disagree with me you

432
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,160
 might both might disagree with me here but I think on this shortlist there are three interesting books

433
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,840
 and three kind of potentially well done but not particularly interesting books and I definitely

434
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,720
 feel like the the koala is one of the is one of the ones that does not particularly like excite me

435
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,760
 on an intellectual level oh oh it excited me on an intellectual level and by that it mean

436
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,640
 you know it kind of had me wanting to stamp things on an intellectual level shall we start with

437
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,960
 if I'm given a choice between a future where we've dismantled the general the gender binary but

438
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,080
 capitalism is alive and well or one where we've dismantled capitalism and the gender binary is

439
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,880
 alive and well I'll take the second one thank you very much this is a book where rich people do

440
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,880
 rich people things and not only get away with it but use the fact that they're rich endlessly to

441
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,480
 push the plot forward and I just wanted to stab them through the eyes all the fucking time sorry

442
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,200
 and then they tell me they're funny which they do a lot I really did not like this novel and I

443
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,920
 didn't like it because it is all about how if you have privilege you could use it to get your

444
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,120
 own way a lot and that's kind of what the plot is yeah I mean I deeply disliked it I think for

445
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,920
 part of the same reason I listened it which is if you're going to set up a plot where you know I

446
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,400
 think the idea of a mystery where you know a woman has to solve it because her husband has been

447
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,520
 wrongfully accused of murder and he's a detective but he can't do any detecting is a great set up

448
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:07,040
 but you can't then also make that woman like the solar system's richest woman and she spends a lot

449
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,680
 of the beginning of the book basically going around doing a kind of don't you know who I am

450
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,880
 here's my extremely high-powered lawyer on on video call by the way I did think kind of a lot of

451
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,920
 the lawyer stuff was supposed to be funny about her the fact that she's continually on time delay

452
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,560
 as they get further and further out on the cruise liner in space but it never kind of got particularly

453
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,280
 funny it just ended up being a bit sort of like a cagey this lawyer person comes in so I think

454
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,800
 the problem there is that by starting off of this premise and then having someone kind of try and

455
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,600
 lampshade it by saying I know I shouldn't use my privilege for this but I'm going to just end it

456
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,400
 up not working and so then I wasn't rooting for her to solve the mystery I was almost

457
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,520
 rooting for all the service people that she's kind of mean to along the way and she just try and

458
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,720
 count it at the end by you know being nicer to some of them but when she's you know going oh well

459
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,560
 the martini is made by this bartender and not very good I'm like I do not care that you are

460
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:18,400
 getting a substandard martini and while we're talking about um there is a service dog in this

461
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:25,360
 book and they relate they talk repeatedly about how you must not you know the service dog is a

462
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,960
 working dog so you shouldn't do things that detract from the fact the service dog is working and then

463
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,800
 whenever it suits her the service dog is sent off to do some non-service dog thing and I'm like oh

464
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:45,440
 god you know I really hate it when this happens in the real world you know I don't I it's fine that

465
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,240
 you're getting to bring your dog into the cinema because it's a service dog if you then get it to

466
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,960
 jump up and down on the seats and eat and eat other people's popcorn that is still annoying

467
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,800
 right you know if it's if it's a working dog it has to be working right at least most of the time

468
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,120
 and it's not what I like is that we have contrived to have two Hugo novel episodes one in which

469
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:13,600
 Alison runs about cats and the other in which Alison runs about dogs this is very good oh yeah so

470
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,280
 I don't talk a lot about the fact that I don't believe in private pet ownership but you know

471
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,800
 I agree with that there's a novel for a lot of I will use the dog as a convenient distraction

472
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,680
 here and I think it maybe undermines what you know from my non-expert view is a pretty good

473
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,200
 portrayal of PTSD and chronic pain and some of the more interesting stuff was about how she can

474
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,200
 essentially dial it up or down but there'll be consequences later although I was waiting for

475
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,880
 the consequences to really kick in at a key point and they didn't so much you know but that is a

476
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,760
 great concept among the more science fictional things about it yeah and I think one of the

477
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,680
 things I like about this is the portrayal of of chronic pain and mental health I thought was

478
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,680
 very good and something you don't see as often as it would be nice to see in SF. So yeah I agree with

479
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,440
 that for sure I have liked everything else I've read by Cole so I think this is just

480
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,360
 an aberration really if it's a series I'll probably won't read the next one unless it's all the Hugo

481
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,680
 Ballot I don't think it is a series I think it's standalone if this wasn't the Hugo Ballot I would

482
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,640
 not pick it up because I've previously put down and closed one of Cole's levels after 100 pages I

483
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,840
 know they're not for me but it's on the Hugo Ballot so I'm reading it I do want to say one more thing

484
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:36,640
 which is I also didn't find it very satisfying as a mystery like I didn't find it never had that

485
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,600
 kind of oh so that's what was going on kind of oh yes moment it kind of like occasionally

486
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:49,760
 things trickled out but didn't seem to have the right weight okay so I'll trip back to the thin

487
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,320
 man one of the things about the thin man that I think probably this book is doing is that the

488
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,600
 mystery is not the point of that film and not the point I believe the sequels that the mystery is

489
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:05,920
 something on which the comedy between the main characters the detective couple is placed that

490
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,520
 they're they just kind of are funny all of the time every scene they're in is funny and they do a

491
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,160
 lot of funny physical comedy and funny verbal comedy and I think that is what she was trying to

492
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,840
 catch here so I think that's why I don't I do think it was intended to be a funny novel that is

493
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:28,080
 also a mystery I I was quite surprised by the suggestion that's not the case so I maybe maybe

494
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,280
 I'm wrong about this or maybe or maybe it's possible that Cowell didn't notice that the thin man is funny

495
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,400
 okay I have a very interesting article about Cowell about what she's taking from the thin man I think

496
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:47,360
 one of the things that strikes me as a binary or not a binary a um parallel between your

497
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:51,840
 description of the thin man on a previous episode and this book is that they are both depictions of

498
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:57,200
 married people who are married where they are just married like and they have affection for one

499
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,880
 another and I like that and that's not something again you don't I think obviously not everyone

500
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,960
 jives with Cowell's just depictions of these things but I do like that one of the things in the

501
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,600
 calculating style as well was like a happily married couple who are happily married and that

502
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,040
 I do enjoy in her work so I can see why the thin man might have resonated for her on that level

503
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,960
 I wanted more fleshing out of the husband in that case he is a bit of a cipher yeah I one of the

504
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,320
 takes I read on this novel was that it's the same husband she always has in all of her books

505
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,840
 um which I thought was interesting um I don't know I haven't read enough Cowell to really know whether

506
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:43,200
 that's fair have you read the oh there's one of the calculating styles novels towards the end

507
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:52,560
 which has like a husband who is a senator and he is quite different in a way if I recall correctly

508
00:47:52,560 --> 00:48:00,160
 um back on the wood book is a few while since I read them then it is nettle and bone

509
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:06,960
 by Tkingfisher which I picked on the episode one of the episodes leading up to Eastercon so

510
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:15,600
 I pre-seed it there I forgot you picked it sorry do one of you two want to give a summary it is a

511
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:22,400
 fairy tale book in in that it lives in the world of fairy tales it is deeply unsettling in the way

512
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,600
 that um a lot of fairy tales are in their original forms but often not in the forms in which they

513
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:35,120
 are now read to children so it's got quite a lot of things pulled out of myth and I think almost the

514
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:42,640
 first page Tkingfisher who is the pen name of Ursula Vernon quotes from an english folk tale

515
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,320
 where she is building a dog out of bones and she reflects on the folk song where

516
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:55,920
 somebody is making a harp out of a woman's bones and other part body parts and I I that's

517
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,600
 obviously the sort of thing I like and I instantly kind of want oh no it's that sort of here we are

518
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,680
 in the world of the world of fairy tales in which people are not necessarily nice and it proceeds

519
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,920
 along those lines and people are not necessarily nice and it has something very much in common

520
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,960
 with legends and lattes which is that as our heroine goes along trying to complete her task

521
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:23,120
 which is much much less savory than opening a coffee shop she finds a lot of people who help

522
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:29,120
 her but they are deeply difficult and unsettling and strange people who are not necessarily always

523
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:35,600
 aligned with her own needs but they form a group working together in a much more satisfying way

524
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:42,640
 than in the coffee shop book yeah I think I'd agree with that I love this especially after reading

525
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:49,040
 the other five I was like oh god a good book oh that's so nice I really enjoyed it I mean I think

526
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:56,320
 I also like the aspect where so our heroine heroine is kind of the third she's the third child of

527
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:02,480
 the king so she is a princess and her you know she's trying to basically um kill the prince who's

528
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:09,680
 married both of her oldest sisters because he needs to be removed but I liked how there's kind of like

529
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:16,080
 the queen is in there as well and you know there's the inevitability of well all I can do to keep

530
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:22,080
 the kingdom together is to do what I can and use my children sort of as pawns on the board and I

531
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,720
 liked you know I don't think she completely forgives them mother for it but she kind of comes around

532
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,080
 to understand like the situation she was in and what she had to do because nothing is too light

533
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:38,880
 and fluffy it is just kind of the reality of the world she's drawn I like that I liked all the

534
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:46,480
 different the different witches so I think there's sort of multiple figures who have magic or powers

535
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:53,280
 or witchcraft we've got the dust switch and uh different fairy godmothers or possibly cursing god

536
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,040
 mothers and I thought that was an interesting like to have these different ladies of different

537
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:03,360
 personalities all doing magic in different ways I can't say my mind is in like completely blown by

538
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:11,200
 it but I do enjoy it it's a lovely kind of little whimsical dark fairy tale I like the chicken

539
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,840
 there's a demonic chicken I love the demonic chicken yeah demonic chicken is great when they

540
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:23,680
 turn this into a movie the demonic chicken will be played by Alan Tudyk no it's really good I can't

541
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,400
 I mean I read ages ago but I remember it being good I will say it felt very much like a young

542
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,720
 adult novel to me which I think is probably like a lot of kingfishers works have been

543
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:43,520
 um young adult uh novels so that makes sense I think it's really good and I think it's the best

544
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,520
 of the novels on the ballot but I don't think it's as good as like previous best novel winners have

545
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,720
 been oh there's been some turkeys that have also been some turkeys that's true and it's definitely

546
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,240
 better than Wonder Woman I think you're right on the adult thing and the one thing I might

547
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:05,760
 do it for is the main character is you know in her 30s for most of the book and yes she's been very

548
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,720
 cloistered and sheltered but she sometimes feels a bit like a young adult teenage protagonist

549
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:18,720
 yeah no I'd agree with that she is she she is played but she's reading very young for somebody

550
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:25,280
 who's supposed to be in their early 30s even if they have been um living in a nunnery for for 15 years

551
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,920
 yeah and it means the romance feels a bit weird yes that's fair yeah gotta love me a good strong

552
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,480
 silent paladin type though like those and I think that I guess I might be what I mean by

553
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,240
 feeling very young adult which is that I think young adult books everyone reads like a kind of

554
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:49,600
 teenager and in this there's not I liked all the characters and they who did all feel different

555
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:57,040
 but there was only like one character who didn't just feel like kind of a teenager to me but maybe

556
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:04,640
 that's unfair oh the mother doesn't the fairy godmother doesn't the dustwife doesn't the demonic

557
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,000
 chicken doesn't the demonic chicken could be quite teenage and the bone dog put it this way I was

558
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,160
 imagining the main character as being in her teens but I did not pick up on an awkward thing with

559
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,960
 paladin because the paladin was also reading like a broody teenager to me and so like they both

560
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:27,360
 felt pretty compatible uh and I know like text you willy they are not teenagers but like that was

561
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,400
 very much how I was imagining them and it has to do with the the voice I guess yeah it feels like

562
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,000
 you know a princess going off on a quest with the wit and the fairy godmother and then you think

563
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,320
 you kind of expect the princess is a teenager not a grown woman and so maybe that expectation also

564
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:49,520
 plays into it you could subvert it a little bit more yes I'm not sure she's learned enough from

565
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,040
 her 15 you know she's done quite a she's not got 15 years of experience in that nunnery right

566
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,480
 it's not showing in what she does I guess the problem is that I've got

567
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,560
 and they've got a fuck all experience of the real world as well but they definitely manifest as

568
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:13,280
 grumpy 50 year olds rather than teenagers yeah but you don't you don't have to be grumpy Sue Mason is a

569
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:20,800
 is a spinster right and a Liz I'm heading for it I'm gonna get some cats but like neither Liz nor Sue

570
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:27,440
 come across as teenagers to me if that makes sense like I think there is a even if you are very

571
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,240
 sheltered there is a definite teenagerness to the character in this book that I feel like you do not

572
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,720
 have as you age even if you do spend most your life in a very sheltered but it's a very it's a very

573
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,600
 minor ding and I think it's mostly to do with the again coming back to like I think a lot of king

574
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:48,960
 fishes books are in the young adult kind of wheelhouse so like I'm not sure it's like something she's

575
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,360
 tried to do and failed as much it is just like something I noticed as if that if that makes

576
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,440
 sense I mean this is an adult novel not a young adult novel but it feels more like a young adult

577
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,040
 novel than a lot of a lot of adult fantasy might yeah it's just not that long it's quite

578
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,680
 it I would have thought it was accessible I'd happily give this book to teenagers

579
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,200
 which is always one of the things I think about I mean I give books to teenagers that people

580
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,160
 wouldn't because I remember what I was reading when I was a teenager so people like you couldn't

581
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,640
 give that to a teenager I was like that's fine I think if this was in the load star category I would

582
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,840
 not blink an eye at it really if being suitable for a load star as well yeah I mean maybe that's

583
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,400
 just because you know YA and Adel cross over a bit more but you know a wizard's guide to defensive

584
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,080
 baking was in the you know the load star and had a teenage protagonist and this does not feel

585
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:43,120
 dramatically different I like them both but yeah yeah it's got a lot of hard words here about the

586
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:50,320
 way in which women are treated in fairy tale worlds and indeed often not in fairy tale worlds

587
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,880
 that you know you might not want your kids to know about until they grow up and experience

588
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,080
 at first hand but there we go I was just going to say that Christian Cushor's books which are also

589
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:04,880
 young Adel in theory have a lot of this about like women's place in the world and you know the

590
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,560
 control of women and nobility and things like that so it felt like I came from the same well

591
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:17,760
 I also like those a lot so I've been to know if any experts in kind of children's or young Adel

592
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,000
 fiction are listening but I think I've read in general I think I've read that um YA does tend

593
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,640
 to deal with more adult themes than adults think it does if that makes sense I would also say I

594
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,000
 didn't like it as much as defensive making. Tense of baking is great though so you know that might be

595
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,440
 why but it is but it is still very like because I'm like trying to think of interesting things to

596
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,160
 say about the thing and it's way more interesting to pick up a pick at like the very minor criticisms

597
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:52,160
 I have than I really liked it so like is tricky. I found this very satisfying I like this better

598
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,720
 than a defensive baking I like defensive baking well enough but I thought it was a romp whereas

599
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:04,560
 I felt like this was really getting into the the very very satisfying meat of myth and magic and

600
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,360
 and how they work and what the trade-offs they're alike and I like that sort of thing.

601
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,320
 And also I quite I did like Bone Dog quite a lot I thought Bone Dog was quite a good dog and

602
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:19,360
 you know having I don't want to you to think that I'm entirely against animals um yeah when

603
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,840
 they're kind of magic magic bone dogs that's pretty good and I love the fact they put fur on him later

604
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,480
 I thought that was probably a good move. I did like the way it starts in media's res with her

605
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:35,680
 like animating a bone dog. Yes I think also so so legends and lattes and casual preservation

606
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,200
 society which both about as long as this book very much tell a story in a very here is the

607
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,800
 start of the story and here is the end of the story and here we are going through the story

608
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,120
 one beaters of time as you know it was if anything more complicated than that would

609
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:56,240
 overwhelm us so I do quite like this was told in a in a more imaginative way and nevertheless in

610
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:01,360
 quite it's quite a short one. Yeah I think structurally this is more impressive than

611
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:07,280
 several of the other books on the shortlist like in terms of how it is written I think you are right

612
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,800
 and I guess I loved it was a great place to start I was I was very into this book as soon as that

613
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:21,920
 dog was made and then it was yeah it's good. Right so then it is time to do our rankings

614
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,040
 who wants to do their ranking first? I'm still thinking it's a bit tricky because I've definitely

615
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,480
 got a top three in a bottom three years just the ordering within those might change but okay I

616
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:39,680
 shall I start because I think I've got a nailed on order yeah go on them all right so I'm making

617
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:46,160
 a spreadsheet I'm checking it twice gonna find out who's naughty and nice so I'm gonna put

618
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:54,400
 Kaiju in sixth. Oh I see we're going in reverse order. We're going in reverse order I think the

619
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:00,960
 reason I'm putting Legends of Blartes in five is that I have read several uh John Scalzi adventure

620
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,440
 books which didn't really tax me very much and had lots of quippy people in them and although it's

621
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,800
 not a I'm not on fond of that form it doesn't really feel like I haven't seen it before whereas

622
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:17,520
 Legends of Blartes you know is slightly fresher and then in four I'm going for the spare man I

623
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:24,080
 enjoyed it more than you two by what sounds like a country mile but I did I did quite like it.

624
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:32,720
 In third I am putting Nona the ninth because I wanted it to be about 20% shorter and make roughly

625
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,960
 100% more sense then I am putting the daughter of Dr. Moreau because although I didn't necessarily

626
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,480
 think it could hear as well as it might have done I thought it tried to do some interesting

627
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:49,280
 things and I did enjoy it in general and then at the top Nettlem Bone the only one that was

628
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,680
 previously picked on an episode of Octa Thorb and it was pit by me because I have great taste

629
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:01,840
 boom my picks all right Alison right so in sixth place in sixth place the spare man um I really

630
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:06,080
 did hate this book in fifth place Legends of Blartes because as far as I'm concerned it's not

631
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,720
 really a science fiction novel it's a it's a well what would you say alternative universe copy shot

632
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,080
 oh no nothing happens it's fine nothing happens in this book and it's fluffy

633
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,600
 in fourth known of the ninth it has been bumped down the list because it is not in my view a novel

634
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:26,080
 and also it doesn't make any sense and also it's far too long for what it is in third place

635
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:31,680
 Kaiji Preservation Society because luckily I have not read a John Scalsy novel for about 12 years

636
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,000
 so I'd forgotten that they're all alike so as long as I only read one about once every 12 years it'll

637
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,400
 be fine I felt that this was a perfectly serviceable science fiction adventure story in which stuff

638
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:46,480
 happens and it it is also a pandemic book that actually uses that fact quite well and use it to

639
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,800
 help propel the pot and it is fine it's not great um you'll see we're into not great books here in

640
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,200
 second place the daughter of Dr. Moreau because he's just trying to be really interesting and the

641
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:04,800
 fact that it doesn't pull it off really isn't shouldn't be as that much of a um downside and I would

642
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:10,320
 like to see I'm definitely going to read a load more of Moreno-Garcia's books which is not true for

643
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:16,640
 anybody else on this list except probably I will read a lepto and um and then in first place

644
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:21,840
 Nettle and Bone which is a genuinely good book that I enjoyed all the way through and have only

645
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:27,600
 minor reservations about but what I really like in science fiction is like really interesting

646
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,440
 science fiction plots that challenge me and do a lot of interesting world-building and I don't feel

647
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,840
 any of these six books do this I'm not going to put no award ahead of all of them but you know

648
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:42,400
 honestly guys could do better all right and then Liz so I mean there's not a lot of suspense here

649
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,480
 but I will say that I'm putting the spare man in sixth because I don't think it did

650
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,560
 successfully any of the things it was trying to do and I would have stopped reading it if it

651
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:58,240
 went on the shortlist and in fifth I'm putting legends and lattes which does at least do most

652
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:05,040
 of what it attempts to do even if what it does is basically you know some orcs invent the cinnamon

653
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:11,920
 bun and the ceiling fan well done um in fourth we are going for the Kaju Preservation Society

654
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,760
 because it's fun enough I mean I liked it more than I was expecting to actually because I again

655
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,840
 I would not normally read John Scalzi's books unless they're on the shortlist because

656
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:29,040
 I find their hit rate is not great for me but I finished it it was entertaining did you know

657
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:36,480
 tech billionaires and maybe not great guys I did learn that from this book in third I will put

658
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:42,960
 no one other ninth because like I liked it but I don't know what's going on and second it's a

659
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,160
 daughter of Dr. Morro by Sylvia Moreno-Gossie which I do think is genuinely really interesting

660
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,600
 and I have read other of Moreno-Gossie's books I just don't think this is one that particularly

661
01:02:53,600 --> 01:03:00,640
 appeals to me and in first place I'm going to put Netlum-Bong by T. Kingfisher which is pretty good.

662
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:09,440
 So Liz has also described the consensus list. Liz you are the average this year I did not

663
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:16,880
 realize how much Alison liked John Scalzi that is wild to me third crazy that is that is by far

664
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:23,280
 like the Kaju is the one that splits us the most I I apparently thought it was much worse than both

665
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:31,040
 of you third third good lord I should have been meaner about that book in the Kaju section third

666
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,720
 but it's yeah it's it's only because it's only because I really don't like voting for books that

667
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:43,200
 instalvers the series third John I didn't say where I was putting no award oh where are you

668
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:49,600
 putting no award yes no so are you putting no award above or below any of these books Liz maybe

669
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:55,040
 I'm I'm thinking about it but if my personal view is you should you should put something to

670
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:00,720
 low no award if you would genuinely prefer that nothing got the prize rather than this book

671
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:14,800
 I think I think I only no award things for philosophical reasons by which I mean either

672
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,560
 either stuff like the puppies where I'm like no philosophically I disagree with these people

673
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:24,560
 or the philosophical reason of something not being a novel so like if you know you mentioned the

674
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:29,840
 Clarksworld short story where it's basically a non-fiction piece with lots of footnotes it that

675
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,600
 is the sort thing I might put below no award if I'm like well this isn't the short story so what

676
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:41,280
 are you doing but I I very rarely I probably won't just because I feel I wouldn't be appalled if

677
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:48,640
 the spare man won but I'd be quite surprised I feel like writing books is hard history I couldn't

678
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:54,560
 do a bad job so writing books and pandemics is hard we should we should be nice to our authors

679
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:00,720
 we're glad they write books for us I am yes I'm trying to think the last thing I put below no award

680
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:06,640
 and I'm I think I'm much more liberal with the no awarding than you are but I probably won't put

681
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:12,800
 it below anything I just I reserve it for the cases of where I really feel very strongly opposed but

682
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:19,360
 actually if the spare man wins the spare man wins I'm not going to actually be upset do we have a

683
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:24,880
 few minutes for what we would have liked to have seen on this ballot I got how long do you how

684
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:31,520
 long do we have like I could have an entire separate but separate shortlist but we do the

685
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:40,160
 octa thought 2022 awards shortlist I don't have anything to contribute the only one I read was

686
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:46,400
 let let alone a bone that was eligible and that's on it so I just nailed marina oh no you I pretty

687
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,040
 sure you read at least one other thing that you have had as a pick which is eligible Tom

688
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:55,680
 oh which one's that see you've lost chances oh you know that's true should just be all aging

689
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:01,200
 Tricovsky sorry what am I talking about right the fact that there are four age of Tricovsky novels

690
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,800
 on this ballot is a bloody hour age so you've lost chances it's better than all of the books on

691
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:13,520
 this ballot except possibly nettle and bone um no it's better than all of them by an absolute

692
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:18,480
 country mile um I really didn't like the ending of city of lost chances I thought it fell apart

693
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,080
 but apart from that I really really enjoyed it all the way through um so possibly I just didn't

694
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:27,040
 understand the editing it's always a possibility we haven't discussed it in detail um um Sea of

695
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,760
 Tranquility is much better than any of the books on this ballot and satisfies my proper science

696
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,400
 fiction requirement and also one the good reason why don't understand why it's not on the ballot

697
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:42,080
 those would be my two obvious ones but actually Plutoshine Plutoshine is better than several of

698
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:47,920
 the books on this ballot so oh my god okay that we're definitely going to get letters right in people

699
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,520
 um no so actually so yes so I did read it went to the clock uh finalists so that's interesting

700
01:06:53,520 --> 01:07:01,600
 I don't so yes so city of last so I think I'd keep the our top three uh is nettle bone daughter

701
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:06,800
 daughter daughter known of the night I think probably the three um replacing a knot those three

702
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,360
 so what so I guess if I could put three on here that replaced the kaiju legends and lattes and the

703
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:19,520
 spare man city of last chances um and then probably I really liked the anomaly I know that like that

704
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,480
 was a bit of a divisive book but I would like to see that on there um and then probably the Simon

705
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,680
 Jimenez because I haven't read it but like I'm sure it's great oh yeah here we are I will say

706
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,720
 there is an open question here because there are a couple of books which I was very surprised not

707
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:42,160
 to see on the ballot in a sort of did they decline way rather than a how has that not made the short

708
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:50,160
 list way because I would be astounded if bable wasn't in the top six nominated books and I suspect

709
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:56,720
 that might mean that we find out that it was it got a quang declined the nomination a lot of people

710
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:02,320
 have said this I will be I will be interested to see what the ballot would have looked like without

711
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:08,960
 declined nominations and what would have fallen off and how like our bottom three tallies with that

712
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:15,120
 because I suspect I would dislike bable because I didn't like quangs uh is it the poppy war that

713
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:20,400
 was the first installment of a spare series and I really didn't like that book so unless bable is

714
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:25,200
 very different I suspect I wouldn't like it either um but I was surprised it wasn't on there and

715
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:30,000
 then like you know tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and sea of tranquility are both like names that

716
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,680
 you might have expected to see on there as well oh yes I haven't read tomorrow and tomorrow and

717
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:39,440
 tomorrow right like even though when Liz recommended it it totally immediately fell out of my brain

718
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,000
 and then Lillian said Alison you must read this book in a very book talk way you know this book

719
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,200
 will change your life and so then I decided to read it so but the reason I haven't read it is that I

720
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:56,160
 put my name down on the Libby list on my library and I am number 493 in a queue waiting for one of

721
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:01,680
 three copies so it might be a what this is not quite a fair comparison because I didn't put a hold on

722
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:06,320
 netland bone but when I put holds on all of these books from the library legends of latte's was

723
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:13,600
 by far the most held book it was one I had to wait the longest for um so that was interesting I always

724
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:20,880
 like I was like working out how popular they are with like the library users uh by comparing the

725
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,680
 number of holds anything we haven't mentioned that you think should be on this list oh yeah I mean

726
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:31,280
 I mean definitely I didn't even I'm not even as big a fan of bables a lot of people but I

727
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:37,440
 definitely think it should be on this short list above some of the others well should be on there

728
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:42,320
 probably venomous lump sucker from the cloud list I also like the coral bones more I know

729
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:50,000
 John's making the thumbs down at me put both those on there I would put the mountain in the sea by

730
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,040
 Ray Layla which I picked a few weeks ago I might put tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow on although

731
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:01,120
 it's not like if I'm thinking what I want is books that I think are really good and really

732
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,080
 interesting from a sort of science fictional perspective then it's not super interesting from

733
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:12,640
 the SF perspective but I think it's reasonably good um I might put on The Grief of Stones by

734
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,800
 Catherine Addison which manages to be a more satisfying mystery than the spare man I think

735
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,160
 I've only read one of the Adrian Tchaikovsky's this year and it's very middle book but it's a good

736
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:29,760
 middle book it's just if I was thinking of what what's what science fiction from 2022 would I

737
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,800
 give someone as an example of good science fiction yeah there's a lot that I would take off this

738
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,920
 Ego list and a lot of things I would put on instead I think if I was using that metric as

739
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:45,360
 opposed to how good the books are and isn't the only one I would keep on here is the marino gossier

740
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:50,880
 and maybe that makes me an absolute mad lad but like netler bones very well done but it doesn't

741
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:57,120
 it doesn't feel interesting in the way that that dr. maro does in what it's trying to do maybe

742
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:04,400
 but I wanted to ask you the middle tricovsky was it as middle as known other night because I feel like

743
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:15,200
 no in that I think it does like I mean I know what's going on boo and I think it reintroduces

744
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:20,320
 you to the characters you need to be reintroduced to much better so it's not it's not quite as

745
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:25,600
 middle book but I think also the thing about another ninth is it's very different from the first two

746
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,720
 books and she's obviously going for a different thing with every book in this series whereas

747
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:36,960
 iza void feels more like a space opera book from a space opera trilogy that is building to a great

748
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,080
 big space opera finale and I thoroughly enjoy them all but I'm not sure I would pick that one

749
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:48,640
 as the one to give someone all right anything else any other mentions or it's a good year for

750
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:54,720
 science fiction but a terrible year for the hugos oh I think it's a terrible year for both because

751
01:11:54,720 --> 01:12:00,560
 like I found the clerk list also extremely underwhelming I think the anomaly and venomous

752
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,280
 lump-subcar are the two best ones I've read on that shortlist so far haven't read the coribones yet

753
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:11,440
 but like I didn't think any of them were great so like it feels like slim pickens and I think I

754
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,720
 wonder whether that's to do with this is the year where books that should have been written in 2020

755
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:23,520
 in 2021 should have been being published and I wonder whether we are seeing that effect in the

756
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,960
 science fiction of 2022 and I wonder if it will return to some sort of form in the next couple

757
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:34,400
 of years that is my suspicion and that was the old thought podcast and it's goodbye for me it's

758
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:38,960
 goodbye for me it's goodbye from me
