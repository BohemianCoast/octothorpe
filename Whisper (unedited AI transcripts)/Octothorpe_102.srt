00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 John there appears to be a cow in your room somewhere.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,320
 He said "Boo not Moo".

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,920
 It's all sort of sheep really b-b-b-b-b.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,840
 So in this episode John makes animal noises.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,120
 Meh.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,320
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 102nd episode of Octa Thorpe,

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
 a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,400
 which is coming to you on the 1st of February 2024.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,760
 I'm John Coxin.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,200
 I'm Alison Scott.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
 And I'm Liz Batty.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,240
 Glasgow have opened their hotel bookings and Hugo nominations processes.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,400
 That is just a public service announcement.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,200
 You also might not have got an email because they've had

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,360
 continuing problems with actually getting emails out to people.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,400
 So lots of people say that their Glasgow emails are going into

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,840
 into holes.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
 If this has happened to you obviously check your spam,

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
 but also all of the information is on their website and their Facebook page.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
 So they have got it out in other routes.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,280
 Yeah, I never got an email about hotel booking opening,

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,200
 but I did get the Hugo email twice.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,440
 Yeah, I am getting most of the emails two or three times.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,440
 So that's, I guess that's good.

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,840
 It's better to receive an email twice than none.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,960
 Yeah, I mean, it's a good job that I am paying attention to their other social media,

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
 because otherwise I would not have known like hotel bookings are open.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
 I mean, I'm staff, so I was all right, fine.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,360
 And also on hotel bookings, and indeed this happened to me and I forgot to mention it.

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,640
 When I tried to book, there were only bookings available for double rooms.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
 So if you needed a single or a twin in many of the hotels,

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
 you had to book a double and then go talk to the convention booking people.

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,800
 And I think that is still the case in some circumstances.

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,960
 So if you go and look at your hotel and they have doubles,

35
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,920
 but they don't have other sorts of rooms, do try that.

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
 I assume there were no single rooms, to be honest.

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
 I assume everything is just like a double book for single occupancy,

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
 for which you do get like a fiver off.

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,960
 I think that's right.

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
 But there are twins.

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
 And they may not be twins now, because twin is, we are,

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
 we use a lot more twin rooms than the general public.

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
 So there's often a shortage of twins.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,200
 [Music]

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,800
 And we have some letters of comment.

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,680
 Christopher J Garcia wrote in to say, "I win victory!"

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,080
 So yes, yes he does.

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,480
 And he says he is hoping to be at Worldcom.

49
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,440
 But who knows with this crazy world?

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,840
 I don't, I don't know, with this crazy world, Chris.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,480
 That's the short answer.

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,960
 So yes.

53
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,240
 But yeah, thank you very much for writing in Chris.

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,440
 Chris also spends an unreasonable amount of time

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,680
 staring at the OctoThought logo,

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
 which I very much appreciate.

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,040
 Anyone who is a fan artist appreciates it whenever anyone spends

58
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
 lots and lots of time staring at a piece of art, what they did.

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,200
 It makes you feel like Michelangelo or something.

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,840
 And the campaign to get the OctoThought logo painted on the Vatican starts here.

61
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
 Sistid chapels due for an overhaul, right?

62
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,440
 Anything else or Chris or shall we move along?

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,960
 I think I am still technically a member of the Catholic Church,

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,320
 but maybe that's the sort of thing for which they would excommunicate you.

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,080
 So we had a fantastic letter of comment from Bill Higgins,

66
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,720
 who listened to our episode where we played if we ran the Zucom.

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
 And we said, "If you have been in any of these scenarios,

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,160
 please write to us."

69
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,600
 And Bill said, "I know what this scenario is."

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,160
 So Bill knows who the 12 year old in the games room was.

71
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,680
 And we'll link to his Wikipedia page in the show notes.

72
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
 But you know, Bill says he went to a convention,

73
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,840
 WindyCon in 1978 and shared a room with friends who'd brought along a new student

74
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,120
 called Dallas Eggbutt.

75
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,160
 And he doesn't remember a lot about his conversations with him, but he seemed nice.

76
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,840
 And then it turned out in 1979 that Dallas Eggbutt had disappeared from campus,

77
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,520
 that he was possibly a troubled genius, 16 year old studying computer science.

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,360
 He was a big fan of D and D,

79
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,520
 and maybe he was hiding in the labyrinth of steam tunnels below the campus.

80
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,800
 Apparently he was missing from months.

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,640
 This parents did indeed hire a private detective who wrote a book about the disappearance,

82
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,360
 and this turned into lots of newspapers and TVs,

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,440
 trying to explain D and D and why it might be the sinister mystery

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,280
 and why this teenager had gone missing.

85
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,520
 Yeah, and the detective did in fact send people to look for him at the Nastvik in Louisville.

86
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,400
 I remember this story in real time because when it happened,

87
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,080
 it was the thing that took D and D for being a weird cult game that only a very few people played,

88
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
 something that enormous numbers of people played.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,400
 It was fantastic publicity for the hobby, even as people were going,

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
 "Oh, it's all a tool of Satanism."

91
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,560
 Yes, and I knew that there were rumors about D and D as a tool of Satanism,

92
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,880
 and I mean, it's plot point in "Strainty Things," but I didn't know the exact reason why,

93
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,440
 or that it overlapped with this particular scenario.

94
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,520
 So, yeah, it was really interesting, and you can in fact get this private detective's book

95
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,400
 still on Kindle for about three quid, so I might have to pick it up and read it and find out more.

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,480
 It was brilliant to just get a letter saying,

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,360
 "We were kind of like, 'If you have been in these scenarios, let us know.'"

98
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,960
 And I thought we were going to hear about like the snake that was in ops,

99
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,360
 but no, we heard about one of the other scenarios,

100
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,160
 so thank you very much Bill for writing in.

101
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
 More letters like that, please.

102
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,560
 We also heard from Raj on Mastodon, who said that he was sorry that putting.cool

103
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,400
 doesn't contain delicious desserts, but he was losing a chunk of time browsing the articles,

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,600
 and he also wrote in with the things he enjoyed from 2023.

105
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,080
 If you read, consumed, listened to other things in 2023, please continue to send them in,

106
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,960
 because we will discuss them on a future episode.

107
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,800
 But thank you very much for sending them in, Raj.

108
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,320
 We had a letter from Colin Murtar, a long-time listener, first-time writer,

109
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,000
 who wrote to say that as we knew, but probably didn't mention last time,

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,440
 poor things has been made with the absolute love and support of the Alistair Gray Archive,

111
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,640
 so although it isn't set in Glasgow, it is absolutely a wash with Alistair Gray features,

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,200
 and is a very faithful rendition of the book, I understand, and also says that they loved,

113
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,240
 "Why don't you love me?" but when it came out in her back, went all over Manchester trying to buy

114
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,080
 a copy and couldn't find one. Oh, and every comic shop in Liverpool, and every comic shop in Manchester,

115
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,080
 even after the book had been spotlighted in the Observer, that's possibly why the,

116
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:52,640
 as a result of the book being spotlighted in the Observer Colin, and indeed also mentions ducks by

117
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:59,920
 Kate Biesen, and says these important works aren't necessarily picked up and supported by comic

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,200
 shops, which I think comic shops can't do everything. It's quite a hard business running a comic shop,

119
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,360
 possibly a lot of people who go to comic shops aren't really interested in actual novels in graphic

120
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,840
 novel form. I don't know. I have been lent a copy. I think I read the copy of Friend of the Show,

121
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,960
 Alex Ingram, who also sent us a letter about "Why don't you love me?" saying it was originally

122
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,960
 published in Aces Weekly. Yes, Colin also read it on the website as it was coming out,

123
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,680
 so I was wrong when I said I didn't think it would be published that way. It obviously had.

124
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,320
 Yeah, so Aces Weekly is the online magazine from David Lloyd, so it was originally designed for

125
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,400
 screen, not for printing. And I don't know if that means it's not eligible for a Hugo, because it

126
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,320
 was previously published. No, the way it works is that if it was never previously nominated,

127
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,880
 it's nominated and the year it's collected. That's why Wheel of Time was nominated as a

128
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,360
 compilation when it was, because none of the previous installments had been nominated separately.

129
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,000
 I think so, but comics can be weird about when an arc is deemed to have ended, can't I?

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,080
 Until there was for Scholstitution, Liz. It's not like we're going to be doing that at all this week.

131
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,320
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

132
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,440
 bad, Liz. I can't believe I don't have it open already, to be honest.

133
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,040
 Shall I quote the bit of the Constitution? Oh yeah. Best graphic story or comic, any non-interactive

134
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,520
 science fiction or fantasy story told in graphic form appearing for the first time in the previous

135
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,160
 calendar year? That's the same wording as novel, right? Now, best novel just says a science fiction

136
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
 or fantasy story of 40,000 words and more. It doesn't have that appearing for the previous time in the

137
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,280
 first calendar year, but weirdly. Well, all right, let me let me let me reconstitute my argument.

138
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:45,360
 DIGA was eligible as a single work. Oh yeah, fairies. I mean, I think we always nominate graphic

139
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,680
 novels in the year the graphic novel comes out, yeah, rather than all the time it appeared on the web

140
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,600
 individually, I think. It would be interesting to have a look at this in future, though, that is,

141
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,960
 I didn't realize I just assumed comic was the same wording as novel, but with comic instead of novel,

142
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,200
 and it is interesting that it's not. I can't remember if you've kind of, this has been treated

143
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,400
 as weirdness of if like, you know, the comic with six issues and the last one comes out in November

144
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,280
 of one year and the collection comes out in February or whatever. Ah. Karen said this,

145
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,080
 congratulations on our 100th episode. Thank you very much, Karen. Thanks, Karen. And says,

146
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,880
 have I mentioned that I host a little free puzzle exchange on my front porch? It's a great way to

147
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,160
 play catch and release. And that is, I assume, jigsaw puzzles, because we know from past that

148
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,240
 Karen likes jigsaw puzzles. He said it's a photo which we might stick in the chapter or maybe.

149
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,960
 I think it is jigsaw puzzles because if you zoom in on the picture, it's a picture of lots of jigsaw

150
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,720
 puzzles. It is indeed. And, and the thing about this is that jigsaw puzzles is a great way to do

151
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,480
 this because in fact, my WhatsApp group passes jigsaw puzzles around at great rates because

152
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,960
 lots and lots and lots and lots of people like jigsaw puzzles. My jigsaw brings all the boys to

153
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,840
 the yard and they're like, it's better than yours. We've told you about wrapping and singing on the

154
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,560
 podcast before, Sean. I am a little bit sad for reasons that will become clear. I can't prolong

155
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,840
 this. I told you so as much as I would like. But we had from various people on the subject to Pico

156
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,120
 Con. Basically, it turns out that at the time we recorded Pico Con was not set in stone. It is

157
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,560
 now set in stone. I did put a pick up in the show notes with the date. But yeah, so we heard

158
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,280
 from a couple of people who basically said when they were at university, the bookings for the

159
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,720
 Student Union space didn't open until after Christmas. And so it may be that that is true for Pico Con.

160
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,200
 The only, the only actual primary source we have is Exeter University. Thank you very much to

161
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,480
 Jersey Griffin and Freudian. And then also Edward Moreland wrote in to disagree with me.

162
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,680
 So Edward says he feels like tears of the kingdom is going to lose out to Baldur's Gate 3.

163
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,600
 And I had not considered that possibility. But a lot of other people have also said that to me

164
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,360
 Edward. So I think you're in good company with that opinion. It will be interesting to see which

165
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,840
 one wins. Also, I hope it means I get a free copy of Baldur's Gate 3. Come on Hugo Verpaket.

166
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,880
 Probably not. It depends who's doing the Hugo Verpaket and whether they're prepared to spend

167
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,120
 a vast amount of time currying favor with games companies like I did for the sample one.

168
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,880
 I was hoping to set a precedent though. But we did get a lot of games.

169
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,560
 You did? No, it was good. Do you think they will also send me a PlayStation 5 so I can play

170
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,880
 Baldur's Gate 3? I think it's unlikely that they will send you a PlayStation 5 list. I regret to

171
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,560
 report. So we also heard from Tobe's Valois, a long-time listener first time writer who said

172
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,160
 I am looking forward to the next episode of OctaThorp as I assume you'll be covering the Hugo

173
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,720
 Controversy. And thank you for pointing us at that coat Tobe's because we were like, well, we

174
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
 were just like having a relaxing week. We were like, what is this Hugo? And then we looked at the

175
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,720
 internet. We were like, oh no. Since Tobe's let us know about the Hugo Controversy, Liz has been

176
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,240
 doing a lot of work to understand exactly what's been going on and why. And she now fully understands

177
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,120
 everything that's happened and will summarize it now. I just want you to know how serious I am

178
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,000
 about this. I've actually put down my crochet for this bit. Can I just check Liz? On a scale of

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,760
 one to ten, what would you say is your full understanding of what has happened? What do you

180
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,480
 mean on a scale of one to ten? I'm missing something. I don't think it's actually possible to fully

181
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,080
 understand. I don't think there's a person on the planet who fully understands what's happened.

182
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:31,520
 Oh, I see. This is fun for Rob Hanson, 2062, to unravel. I fully comprehend the mysteries.

183
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:40,480
 I am going to try and summarize the current thing that's going on with the Chengdu Hugos. It might

184
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,640
 take me a little while. If you have already been reading like the internet for the past week and a

185
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,360
 half, then you may skip to the next chapter, which is a good bit and has Marvin in it.

186
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,480
 Prof. Institute Knowledge. We have known for some time that Chengdu have to release the full Hugo

187
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,280
 nomination stats within 90 days. And 90 days was last Saturday, and they did in fact release the

188
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,160
 full nomination stats. Hooray. Oh no, we have questions though. There was a brief period where we

189
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,840
 thought the most controversial thing was that it has taken 91 days, and that was a glorious 12 hours

190
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,760
 that I miss. I actually said in a place I won't reveal online, what if the stats are a big letdown

191
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,880
 now? And they're just not interesting. Wow, I wish I was in that universe. In the first two

192
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
 minutes after the stats were announced, I got various people congratulating me and I set various

193
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,640
 people congratulations for where they had appeared all the nomination stats. This was before we'd

194
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,560
 actually read them. They released the full nomination stats, which for anyone who hasn't looked at them

195
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,160
 are generally the rounds of EPH which cover the top 15 nominees. They also do generally release

196
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,200
 the total number of ballots that voted in each, sorry, nominated in each category. We should say

197
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:57,200
 again what EPH is for the benefit of people who are new listeners. EPH is E-Pervous Hugo. It is the

198
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,600
 way of nominating for the Hugus, which is basically a system that kind of apportions your

199
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,760
 nomination points according to how many items you nominate. And essentially it is an anti-slate

200
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,960
 mechanism that was instituted after the sad puppies. And it works pretty well basically to dilute

201
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,480
 voting slates because it will reduce the total number of points for items that kind of come

202
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,960
 and sit together on people's ballots. If you want a full explanation of EPH, there's actually quite

203
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:32,480
 a good one in the 2022 Hugo nomination stats, last year's ones, which have a lot of extra

204
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,720
 information, helpful numbers, interesting stats, explanations of the voting process. In contrast

205
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,960
 to 2023s, which do not have any of that. Thank you, Nicholas and Kat. Yes. Immediately upon opening

206
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,640
 the 2023 nomination stats, there are a few things that jumped out. The first is that there are a

207
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,880
 number of nominees who have enough points that you would expect them to be on the final ballot

208
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,360
 who are declared not eligible and no explanation is given. Those include "Bable" by R.F. Quang in

209
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:07,200
 Best Novel, Zira and Jay Zhao in the Astounding Award, Paul Weimar in Fan Writer, and the

210
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,520
 "Novelet Fog on Temple" pagoda by Haya. And Tan Man. No, but Tan Man is slightly different.

211
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,760
 Okay. So those are just declared ineligible and there's no reason given. There are items that

212
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,720
 are declared ineligible and there's a footnote that explains why, which include items that were

213
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,360
 not published first in 2022 and one that was removed because one of the authors on the Hugo

214
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,440
 Subcommittee and there declared ineligible. There's also a very weird thing with Sandman where it

215
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,680
 got enough votes to be on the ballot in both best short form and best long form dramatic

216
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,880
 presentation. But then one entry says not eligible because it is eligible in the other category

217
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,960
 and then the other category it just says not eligible. So those things were missing entirely.

218
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,320
 I mean, there's a few people who declined nominations, which is, you know, normally there's a few,

219
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,800
 so that was not unexpected. But yeah, there was no there was no explanation given for these.

220
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,720
 It is now evident from statements made by R.F. Quang, Zira and Jay Zhao and Paul Weimar and Neil

221
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,720
 Gaiman that they did not know that they had been declared ineligible and cannot think of any reason

222
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,520
 why they are ineligible. So they ruled ineligible. No one knows why the, I think, predominant explanation

223
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,640
 from the internet is that they were ruled ineligible because someone on the committee, either because

224
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:30,480
 of overt messaging or just to cover themselves felt that they would be not approved of in China

225
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,480
 and so decided to knock them off the the finalist ballot. And then it got better way of putting that.

226
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,240
 No, I think that's fair. I think that's our working assumption.

227
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,440
 And to say that is our working assumption because we have no information.

228
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,000
 We have a tiny bit of information from a piece in PR2 where China did say that it would administer

229
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,480
 the hugh goes in accordance with wusses constitution and local laws, which people are reading the

230
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,680
 tea leaves of and saying that means we will censor anything we don't like. Which I think is not

231
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,920
 an unreasonable assumption. I think that is the point where they told us they would make these

232
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,440
 sorts of judgments. This is made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

233
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,800
 Yes, I mean, I was going to say if I want it doesn't, it doesn't quite make sense to me

234
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,440
 because I'm not quite sure why you would single out exactly that set of finalists. I mean,

235
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,600
 some I can kind of understand. I mean, Babel certainly is written by an author born in China,

236
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,040
 but now living outside China. People have noted other if that was the if that was a hard of

237
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,480
 ass rule, there are other finalists that would have been mysteriously ruled that weren't so so yeah.

238
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,680
 Yeah, there's a very good blog post by Ada Palmer, which I think we should link to in the show notes

239
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,520
 where she talks about self censorship and censorship and how her regime censorship works.

240
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,040
 And one of the impacts of that is that it's extremely inconsistent. So people have pointed

241
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,520
 out that Babel has a mainstream Chinese publisher, but it may just depend on what the particular

242
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,200
 person who decided that some some finalists had to be taken out was thinking on the day.

243
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,720
 It doesn't need to be consistent because actually consistency is one of the things that comes with

244
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,880
 transparency, which we do not have here. I don't think we can speculate any better than other

245
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,520
 people have on the internet. We have no extra information. We don't really know anything extra.

246
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:29,120
 Just there are a set of nominees who were ruled ineligible and they should not have been by any

247
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,840
 ruling we can find if you're confined solely to the WISFIS Constitution. I think that is fair.

248
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,400
 There is definitely something happening here, which goes above and beyond anything that has

249
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,440
 previously happened with the administration of this award. And we'll get onto this in more

250
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,280
 detail in a minute. Anytime anyone asks the man who released the stats, he just cites vague rules

251
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,760
 and does not elaborate. Because that was one of the things that someone asked on the anonymous

252
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,040
 Claire Discord was like, you know, how similar is this to previous things that have happened?

253
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,200
 And I think the answer is very dissimilar. So if you're relatively new to the Hugo's, this isn't,

254
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,520
 this is new. Yeah, I mean, I think there's been the occasional issue where eligibility has been

255
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,200
 got wrong or where votes have not been canonised properly. And so stuff has left left off the ballot

256
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,120
 that should have been on or potentially been on the ballot that should not have been, especially

257
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,280
 for things where the eligibility is quite difficult to determine. But I don't think anything has just

258
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,240
 been not eligible when it clearly should be. There's also some issues with the ballot based on

259
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,800
 digging around in the EPH point transfers. I'll point your transfer. That doesn't even make sense,

260
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:41,520
 John. It wasn't intended to Liz. So one, one thing is that because of the way EPH works,

261
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,280
 every individual essentially gets one point that is split across everything nominated on their ballot.

262
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,480
 The practical effect is that the number of points of EPH that never exceed the number of people who

263
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,320
 nominated in a particular category. I checked the stats for the past four years and yes, the number

264
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,160
 of points never exceeds the number of people who nominated in a category. In 2023, in four categories,

265
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,320
 it does. I think it's just that the people nominating in 2023 were more engaged than previous Liz.

266
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,680
 Liz, does that answer the question? No, you can't have something that's some some more than 100%.

267
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:22,560
 You can. You can give 110% Liz. I've seen sports movies. Have you covered the ludicrous

268
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,120
 absolute nomination figures here? She's working on it. She's working on it.

269
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,000
 No, I'm getting to them. I'm getting to them. The other issue, I mean, there's also some

270
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,720
 strangeness in EPH in best related work in which the number of total points which

271
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,560
 should always ever go down as stuff is removed goes up again and then back down. It's weird.

272
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,240
 I mean, the other thing is those things are definitely, there is no way under EPH these numbers can be

273
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,160
 correct. There are also things which are like, well, these numbers could be correct, but they're

274
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:59,600
 really weird. In quite a few categories, there are very, very high numbers of nominations. I mean,

275
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,440
 we knew the nomination numbers were high because they announced like the total number of nominating

276
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,160
 ballots, but that is explainable, right? Because you've just got a lot of members who are nominating.

277
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,760
 However, it's really weird when you have, for instance, in best series, like the top set of

278
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,920
 nominees all have over 800 nominations, and then the next one has 50. Like it is this very weird

279
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,440
 pattern where the top ones have a huge number of nominations and then the number falls off.

280
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,320
 And this is most pronounced in like best novel and best series, but it's also there in quite a lot

281
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,400
 of categories. Like there's a lot of categories where the numbers just look a bit higher than you

282
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,360
 would normally expect. I mean, including fan cast. Like, you know, in theory, according to these

283
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,440
 nomination stats, Octa thought got 150 nominations, which is almost as many as our number of regular

284
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,960
 listeners. I think it's 125. So no, but let me look it up. So yes, I will say that in 2021, when we

285
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:59,760
 were not in the ballot, we got 20 nominations in 2022. When we were, we got 46. And in 2023,

286
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:08,400
 we got 125. So that is a pretty like, it is big jump, probably a bigger jump than is possible.

287
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,960
 Yeah, it's true. Oh, that's hard because we doubled from one year to the next year. And if

288
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,280
 we doubled again, we would have had 80. So 120 is like probably too many. But it's not as too many

289
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,440
 as it might sound. I'm probably doubling every year. It might be better to assume 20 extra every

290
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,480
 year, in which case, like it would be 60 out. I think the thing is, in a lot of categories,

291
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,040
 the top end was a bit higher than you would expect. But like the bottom end is still low.

292
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,760
 Like if everything shifts up, that's one thing, but like the bottom end of fan cast,

293
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,800
 like by the time he gets a 15th nominee, it's still like five nominations or whatever. It's not

294
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,440
 like it pulled the whole thing up. It's just the top. And I would say the last thing is,

295
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:59,120
 there's some of the redistribution of votes, which is a bit strange. Basically, in EPH, you can see

296
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,560
 when someone is eliminated, where their their who else's points totals go up, which means that

297
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,760
 they were on the ballot of some nominees together. Now let me explain that in a better way. So in

298
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:17,280
 EPH, when an item gets eliminated, it means that all the ballots with that item on will give slightly

299
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,360
 more points to the other items on that ballot. Basically, you get more power as stuff that was

300
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,720
 on your ballot was eliminated. And so you can see where the points go when any one, you know,

301
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,920
 potential finalist is eliminated. And you can see in a lot of cases on this ballot where there is a

302
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,840
 mix of nominees from Chinese fandom and from Western fandom, you can see them kind of redistribute

303
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,600
 how you might expect when one of the Chinese nominees for best artists is eliminated. Their

304
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,520
 votes go to other Chinese nominees. And mostly when one of the Western nominees is eliminated,

305
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,360
 their votes go to other Western nominees. But there's a few kind of strange examples where

306
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,920
 this doesn't happen. There's one in in best novel, the redistribution of the nominations for a

307
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,360
 novel called the Red Stone, which all seem to go to the mountain in the sea, which was spotted by

308
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,000
 Commestras for Lapton. I should say also lots of people spotted the errors in the kind of EPA

309
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,760
 and the weird distributions, including Marshall Mreska, Heather Rose Jones and Commestras

310
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,720
 Flapton, and James Quinn, who came up with the EPH system, is also looking at it on blue sky.

311
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,880
 But yeah, there's stuff like when David Pomerico is eliminated in best edit, it's a long form.

312
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,880
 None of his votes redistribute to any of the other American editors on the ballot. They all

313
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,600
 redistribute to only one Chinese nominee, which is just a really weird pattern that you wouldn't

314
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,000
 expect, especially when, you know, the person who gets eliminated after him, their points

315
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,880
 transfer to nearly all of the like top, they're transferred like six of the top seven left on the

316
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,920
 ballot. And then when this other editor gets eliminated, they all go in one direction, which

317
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,520
 basically, which to the point where you can work out that like there must have been like 72 ballots

318
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,600
 that only had like these two editors on of the top 15, it's just a weird, it's just weird patterns.

319
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,240
 I spent a lot of time staring at figures and graphs in order to bring you this segment,

320
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,920
 and I hope you now understand basically. I mean, this is good a show. I don't understand it other

321
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,960
 than understanding the vibe, but it's basically very similar to single transferable vote, but for

322
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,800
 nominations instead of voting. Oh, no. Oh, no, I think it is. You have like, you have your preferences

323
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,640
 and as they get eliminated, your other preferences get redistributed.

324
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,680
 But there's never a penalty in SDV for having multiple things on your ballot. There is interior

325
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:36,880
 penalty in EPH if you nominate five things and they all have sufficiently low totals, they all

326
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,880
 get eliminated before you get to the later rounds. You'll never get anything on the ballot.

327
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,880
 Yeah, I guess that's true. I get the values, which it's designed to be kind of fair and proportional

328
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:54,800
 and to never reward kind of runaway success. Yeah. From a value standpoint, yes, it has the same vibe.

329
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,880
 Quite like it from a vibe standpoint, but I might be alone. No, I like it.

330
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,280
 I think if that's a, is that the summary of what we think has happened? Because I think it would

331
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,840
 be good to have a little bit of reaction here, because I have a reaction I want to get in

332
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,200
 before we start talking about all of the implications. I think that is the summary in a very technical

333
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,040
 way. You know, and I kind of stopped way earlier and just said, look, the stats look weird.

334
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:31,280
 My reaction is as follows, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo. After I kind of started to look at the stats

335
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:37,920
 a little closer and realize they were all screwed up, it made me very unhappy because this was my

336
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:44,480
 first ever individual Hugo nomination after 40 years of phalak. And it was so it's really,

337
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,160
 it really sucks. It sucks to be a Hugo finalist this year, especially if you, you're in that sort

338
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,960
 of position. People have been calling for, well, why don't we rerun the awards or something? I don't

339
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,280
 think that's very practical. I don't think it's going to happen. I think it just sucks. And we now

340
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:06,800
 have a slightly, a slightly tainted set of awards, which is a bit sad. And I think there's no way that

341
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,520
 can't take some of the joy away from from the people who won and the people who were finalists.

342
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:19,680
 I want to say something here, which is so my, Españo, my wife was also a finalist and she

343
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,840
 is also very conflicted about that. I don't understand why the nominations were fiddled,

344
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,800
 because they declared anything they didn't want to be on the ballot ineligible by magic anyway.

345
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,760
 So I don't really see why they went into the numbers. Like, if they were going to just do it

346
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,240
 by fiat, I don't understand why not just do it by fiat. And I will say like, obviously,

347
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,960
 I think any finalist who was on the ballot prior to this year, or prior to 2023, I should say,

348
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,120
 like there is a very good chance that they would have been on the ballot, like in 2023,

349
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,800
 if they'd been on before. So I think those people are probably less conflicted. But if you're a

350
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:05,040
 first time finalist or the first time finalist for a long time, it must be very, very, very sad.

351
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,000
 My gut feeling is that I don't understand what the motivation for the fiddling is,

352
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,720
 but my gut feeling is that like no one in the team had like a special interest in getting like

353
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,320
 Alice and Españo, for instance, onto the best fan artist ballot. And so I think that if and if

354
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,480
 the awards have been run the way they usually run, Alice and Españo would still have been on that

355
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,200
 ballot. It's, but the thing is that the voice in my head telling me that's not true is way quieter

356
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,040
 for me than it is for someone who's in that position, because I've had anxiety and I know

357
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,000
 how those little voices in your head work. And so it must really be horrible. And it's really

358
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,920
 annoying that it's tainted that whole thing. And you can't, you can't take that taint away,

359
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,240
 because it wouldn't be rerunning the awards, or it wouldn't be rerunning the voting, it'd be

360
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,520
 running rerunning nominations. And there's no way that people wouldn't nominate the things,

361
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,800
 like, you know, Españo said that she didn't make it on legitimately. So I'm sure lots of people

362
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,400
 would nominate her, because they're like, fuck those people who made her feel sad,

363
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,920
 she deserves to be on the ballot. And so I don't, there's no way you can go. The only way to go

364
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,160
 back and have a fair Hugo is to invent the time machine. And we can't obviously do that. I mean,

365
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,320
 despite the fact that we've got one as referenced in episode 98, I can't remember exactly which

366
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,520
 one it was, but I don't see a way of going back and having a fair process.

367
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,240
 Just go back to episode 98 and record a pickup, John, you have a time machine.

368
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,880
 Hahaha. But I will say, I think it's also notable that they released the voting stats a

369
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,600
 long time before the nomination stats. And that to me says that there wasn't a problem, or there

370
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,640
 wasn't fiddling in the actual voting. And so I think if you were on the ballot and then you won,

371
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,840
 you got that win on that ballot. And I think if you are a winner, you should hold your head high

372
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,880
 and celebrate the fact you're a winner. Christopher Jay Garcia said it very well when he said the

373
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,240
 second Hugo he won, he won specifically because he was not a sad puppy and everything else in

374
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,560
 that category was a sad puppy. And therefore, Journey Planet got the Hugo and he loves it just

375
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:12,240
 as much as the other Hugo he has. And I think that is a good attitude to take. If you are a winner,

376
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,000
 I think you are a Hugo winner and you are just as much of a Hugo winner as any of the other Hugo

377
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,120
 winners. And if Hugo others is thing, definitely Hugo Girl, because you know, you deserve those

378
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,040
 rockets and display them on your mantelpiece proudly, please. Like the one thing I would hate for this

379
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,440
 to do is to make those people feel like those rockets weren't worth what they're worth.

380
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,240
 They don't actually have the rockets, you know. We will be getting on to Dave McCarty's

381
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,480
 various talents as Hugo Awards Administrator later, but that is foreshadowing. But it turns out

382
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,440
 shipping rockets to winners is not one of them. Yeah, I mean, I think the voting actually,

383
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,280
 the voting feels pretty consistent with the nomination stats being in some way inflated just to maybe

384
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,720
 up the total numbers. Yeah, there were some, there were some hinky things about the voting stats,

385
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,600
 weren't there? Well, there's just a lot of things that win in the first round, which is not necessarily

386
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,880
 hinky unless like there actually wasn't a huge amount of support for some of the nominees.

387
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,320
 But I mean, it is a different voting population and specifically, like everyone from Chicago

388
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,600
 couldn't nominate, but not necessarily vote. But I mean, it's kind of weird when, you know, in theory,

389
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,320
 the founder's strategy had like 900 plus nominations. And yet when it came to the actual ballot,

390
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,760
 it came in sixth. And in fact, only had 313 people who put it above no award. It's kind of weird

391
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,160
 that something that was so high on the ballot did not have any actual, it didn't turn out to have

392
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,840
 any support at the voting phase. I would let's say two things, which is firstly, we know

393
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,240
 that where you place nominations, the way you place the category aren't always one to one. And

394
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,160
 the best example I can think of this is we discussed on a previous episode and God knows which

395
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:01,360
 year it was, but the person who won best fan writer got on in sixth place and was quite far down in

396
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,840
 the raw number of nominations, but EPH bumped them up quite a bit. But then they ended up winning

397
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,040
 the whole category. And so if it's possible for someone who got by far the fewest raw nominations

398
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,600
 to end up winning, presumably it's possible for the reverse to happen. And we've seen that

399
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,600
 in fairly administered awards, or awards, I assume were fairly administered.

400
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,720
 Yes, that's true. The reason I argued, I think the votes are solid is because I think if they

401
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,120
 weren't, they would have come out at the same time as the nonce. The behaviour of the Hugo

402
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,040
 subcommittee makes me think the votes are unlikely to be rigged. Does that make sense?

403
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,320
 It does make sense, yeah. Okay, so I think it is possible that there is inaccurate data in the

404
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,040
 voting, but it's clearly not as much. The inaccurate data, the reason the nomination statistics were

405
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,840
 further delayed was because of the, I think, is because of the unexplained ineligible,

406
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,360
 because I think if it was just that the voting data was, the nomination data was corrupt and

407
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,720
 hinky, we'd probably have stopped. The row would have been much less. So that's the first thing.

408
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
 And the second thing is I do think it was just they were so desperate to say the most

409
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,640
 nominees ever, that they just dumped a load of erroneous nomination data in there,

410
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,800
 forgetting that somebody was going to look at it later. I think a lot of people didn't think

411
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:23,680
 that the nominating statistics got much attention, which, you know, if they'd been paying attention,

412
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,120
 they would know that the nominating statistics always get a lot of attention.

413
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,720
 I think I agree with John in that I can't understand why you would, like, if you're going to tweak

414
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
 the nomination stats, why don't you do it by just inventing a bunch of extra ballots and putting

415
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,680
 them into the system? But that would not explain why the numbers don't add up.

416
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,560
 So it's kind of weird that you're like, I don't know. I think what I'm saying here is,

417
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,400
 if I was, like, faking some Hugo nominees, I would do a better job.

418
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:57,040
 Liz in wants to fake Hugo's better controversy.

419
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:05,680
 So one of the explanations is that a standard form of protest in China is that you release

420
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,800
 something that is clearly nonsense as a way of protesting because that's a form of protest

421
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,040
 that is often acceptable. I understand. And then nobody says anything because everybody knows

422
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,800
 that you don't say anything because it's China. And so we've had a combination of that form of,

423
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,160
 I have released nonsense data because I know it is a form of protest against the repression and

424
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:33,360
 censorship combined with, but in Western fandom in particular, everybody says everything because,

425
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,000
 you know, people do thereby creating a storm.

426
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,280
 Do we want to segue from that to the reaction of Chinese fans?

427
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,920
 To go back to the thing of, like, did the people who did this not realize that the nominations

428
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,160
 would get quite a lot of scrutiny? Have they not been paying attention? There have been a lot of

429
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:57,040
 rumblings over the last few months that the Chinese people on the committee were not the fans

430
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,120
 that originally wanted to hold the Worldcon. And there is a letter in file 770, which was posted

431
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:10,480
 yesterday by a Chinese fan. And it's really interesting because that fan basically goes into

432
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,040
 some detail. But it is not our intention to defend the arrogant, haughty and insolent Dave

433
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,000
 McCarthy, more on whom later yet, while he was the target for the most firepower, some bugbears

434
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 masquerading as Chinese were stealthily making their way through the organizing committee.

435
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,200
 They were never science fiction fans in the first place. They were not a part of fandom.

436
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,480
 A couple of media companies executives have somehow gotten involved in the convention,

437
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,400
 taken over everything including the Hero Wars, and used their few contacts in the media world to make

438
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,920
 a bid splash in the press and in government hospitality receptions. They then passed the job of external

439
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,520
 surrender to McCarthy, who would bend over backward with small favors and the job of internal repression

440
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,200
 to the Chinese workers who had to be forced into surrender through the use of intimidation.

441
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,840
 That's from a Chinese fan. And so I will say, there's been quite a lot of debate and we will get on to

442
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,960
 this. As to whether or not the reason Dave McCarthy has acted how he has was to try and protect.

443
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,120
 The Chinese people who were involved in this decision. But I think that might have been quite

444
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,840
 a pro-kill perspective, because certainly the Chinese fans seem to be utterly fucking furious.

445
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:17,360
 This is not just Western fans applying different views of how it should work to a world con held

446
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:24,000
 in a different country. The Chinese fans who we have reports from seem to be hopping mad about this.

447
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 So the question is, who was Dave McCarthy protecting and the answer appears to be local

448
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,240
 functioners. The reason I read that out and the reason I wanted to do that before we get to Dave

449
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,480
 is because I think that ties into if it was people from media companies who were involved with this

450
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,760
 and it wasn't the local fandom who might have been much more aware of the world

451
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,440
 cometer why they wanted to run one. They wouldn't know, right? They wouldn't necessarily know

452
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,680
 the Spanish traditions, especially Spanish traditions the other side of the Pacific.

453
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,320
 I had not put that together until you guys had that discussion, but I think that might be right.

454
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,240
 And certainly that seems to accord with stuff that's coming out of China itself.

455
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,480
 Yeah, I think you might be right. And also I think, yeah, if you end up with a group of people

456
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,120
 running the world con who, you know, are doing it because they see particular opportunities in it

457
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,440
 and not because they have spent 10 plus years really, really wanting to run a world con and

458
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,640
 bring the Hugo Awards there, then you might not realize. And also I think it is, in no previous

459
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,440
 year, have I scrutinized the stats in quite this much detail. I have never summoned every column and

460
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,000
 row and tried to reconstruct individual ballots. Yes, but Nicholas White has.

461
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,840
 I mean, I think, no, but I think Nicholas White has produced stats, which I am sure he has checked

462
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,720
 because he is a conscientious man. But I don't think external fans have ever dug into the extent

463
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,160
 that we are digging in. I managed to reconstruct basically what the ballots must be for certain

464
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,560
 nominees. I mean, I've looked at transfers, but I've never tried to go, is this number actually

465
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,480
 explainable because we've kind of always trusted them to be so and having checked, like, some

466
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,040
 retrospectively, they have been like that. So I guess you might have thought if you had like

467
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,760
 numbers that looked superficially pretty good and you wouldn't spot any errors unless you dig deep,

468
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,680
 deep, deep, deep in, you might think it was okay. Can we move on to Dave McCarty? As soon as the

469
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,960
 world con ended, Dave was asked where the nominating stats were in the voting stats and said they

470
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,840
 would be the Addentew course. And then he kind of got into a big row with people. And the upshot of

471
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,000
 that row was he was like, we'll not, we'll release them on the last possible date. And of course,

472
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,440
 the voting stats came earlier, but the nominating stats did come out slightly after the last possible

473
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,920
 date. And at that point, Dave, I think must have known that this was going to kick off quite a big

474
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:47,200
 row. And when people started asking him questions about it, he got stroppy. And I mean, not just a

475
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,600
 little bit stroppy. He was phenomenally rude to people. He was rude enough that it's been picked up

476
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:01,040
 all over the wider internet, not merely in a little corner of fandom. It was as if all of these years

477
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,000
 of understanding how you do social media had vanished in a trace. And it was all right for Dave just

478
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,760
 kind of tell people that they're stupid and not reading things properly and didn't understand what

479
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,760
 they were reading. And could they now go away please? And and all of that. And I feel like this was a

480
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,320
 very, very difficult and sensitive situation. And Dave decided to make it a lot worse. He has

481
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,760
 since apologized, and we will put a link in the show notes to the apology. He's apologized for his

482
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,560
 profoundly offensive behavior when he released the stats, but he hasn't apologized for his profoundly

483
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,960
 offensive behavior in China, where he posted multiple photographs of him whining and dining with

484
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,040
 Chinese with the Chinese local organizers, talking about how marvelous China was at every possibility,

485
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:55,280
 launching a new Chinese symposium or award or foundation or something where Dave McCarty was the

486
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,240
 only non Chinese person involved. And all of that stuff, which I feel is actually a much bigger deal.

487
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,480
 And he did all this at a time when he must have known that the data was profoundly corrupt.

488
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,480
 And he did not at that point resign or consider resigning or do anything to indicate he was not

489
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,240
 happy with that process. But I think a lot of this makes a lot more sense if you think

490
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,560
 that Dave genuinely didn't think it would cause a big row, or if it did, he could win the ensuing

491
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,600
 argument. He has said he genuinely didn't think it would cause a big row. He has said he thought he

492
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:37,600
 was only on his public Facebook post, talking to the few people who had asked the questions,

493
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:43,840
 not realizing that those few people were asking questions on behalf of say, all the hugot finalists.

494
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,040
 But I think that if I had been in his situation, which you wouldn't have been because China would

495
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,720
 have come along and said we're going to mess with these figures and you'd have gone, Oh, I resign.

496
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,720
 Depending on when you find out, right? Like if they had said we're going to do this,

497
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,920
 I might have resigned before that happened. If I had ended up in a situation where 90 days after

498
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,640
 the deadline, I have been merrily assuming the stats are all completely kosher. And I do not know

499
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,960
 there has been any interference, which seems highly unlikely, but let's give him maximal benefit of

500
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,880
 the doubt here. If I got today, say I look at the stats at day 85 and I think I'll bugger. There's

501
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,480
 a real problem. The first thing I do is I start talking to people off the record saying I'll

502
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,080
 bugger there is a huge problem. I start trying to diffuse the situation. I what I don't do is 75

503
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,880
 minutes before midnight in my time zone on the day where I have promised to reduce the stats. I don't

504
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,840
 post an RC comment about Oh, I think there's still over an hour left in this day. And then

505
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:43,600
 miss the deadline I've set for myself due to my own incompetence. I don't do that. I don't do any

506
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:50,320
 of these things. And so there's there's obviously and I don't think I'm the most competent man.

507
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,240
 I think I'm relatively confident competent by my mistakes all the time. I handle situations badly

508
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,600
 all the time. I don't think I've ever handled one this badly, but like, there's still time, John.

509
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,520
 There's still time. But both Alice and Elizabeth can testify that I have had

510
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,120
 rails with them where I've not covered myself in glory. The fact that I can see how you would

511
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,120
 get out of this or no, not how you would get out of it. But if I was in this situation,

512
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,680
 there is a way I would deal with it. Dave did not do that. For me to try to interpret his

513
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,040
 motivations is extremely difficult because he very clearly has extremely different motivations

514
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,200
 to me. And that makes it really hard for me to put myself in his head. And so this whole

515
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,960
 thing's really difficult. I'm like, well, you wouldn't do it like this. Like, there's no decision I

516
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,680
 would have made at any point that would let us hear. And I don't fundamentally don't understand

517
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,800
 why he made these decisions. And then we get on. Well, no, then we get on to Liz. Liz, you said

518
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,960
 not five minutes ago that if you fiddled with the Hugo's, you'd do a way better job.

519
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:58,160
 I'm never going to be Hugo and administrative. I can't really I can't really fathom

520
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,120
 Dave either, except that I know like personality wise, Dave is much more argumentative than me. And

521
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:09,360
 I can see so but I think hypothetically, where I in Dave's position, where I had these stats.

522
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,480
 And I had to release them because I promised to release them and they were going to look weird.

523
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,120
 I would just have released them, made the statement he made a few times that we followed all the rules

524
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,360
 and I can give you for further explanation. And then just stop there. There, people are going to

525
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,040
 still debate it. People are going to still argue about it. But there's nothing you can add to this

526
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,960
 conversation here. You just have to stop and say these are the nominations. Yes, I think if I had

527
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,800
 been in Dave's position, which as I said, I would not have been because I think that he has behaved

528
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,000
 in a I he cannot have behaved in an honorable fashion throughout this process. I think is what

529
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,560
 I'd have to say. But if I were in that situation, I would channel Francis Erkwart. If people said

530
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,400
 there's something dodgy about this, I'd go, you know, this is a statement. There isn't another

531
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,120
 statement. I understand that you might assume that something strange has happened, but I couldn't

532
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,360
 possibly comment. I mean, I would add, I think we've seen throughout the Chengdu process that

533
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,880
 they do not respond to random inquiries on social media. They do not put out a lot of

534
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,560
 press releases. They put out what information they want at the time they want and they don't

535
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,240
 really engage with fans all over the internet asking them questions. And so, yeah, okay, if

536
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,360
 you're going to do that, why not stick with that? That at least would not result in everything going

537
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,480
 through for some reason, the Facebook page of the Hugo administrator where he has a big

538
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,960
 argument and insults a bunch of people. I want to pick up something that John said,

539
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,880
 which I think is very relevant here, which is he said, well, if I was in this position, I'd go and

540
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,800
 I'd make soundings off the record with people I trust and who could provide me with useful advice

541
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,800
 on how to manage the situation. I feel that Dave has been very isolated throughout this process,

542
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,840
 that he's not got a lot of help from people around him, even people around him who were

543
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,840
 engaged with China, but certainly not people around him who were not engaged with China. Now,

544
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,960
 that might be because he didn't ask for that help because he thought he knew what he was doing.

545
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,320
 The one other thing I'd like to say before we get off Dave McCarty is to talk about Lenin's notion

546
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:13,600
 of the useful idiot, which is the westerner that a communist regime uses in order to promulgate

547
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:21,440
 their ideas in the west and that you could do this by making life easy for them and they therefore

548
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,960
 think that maybe have a more favorable view of your regime than an unbiased observer would.

549
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,000
 I'm also going to say I'm also going to repeat something I said earlier and I'm going to link

550
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 to a Facebook post, which is a public Facebook post, in our show notes with no further comment.

551
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,120
 The Chinese fan that I quoted earlier on in the episode, I'm going to restate this, which is

552
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,880
 they pass the job of external surrender to McCarthy who would bend over backward with small favors.

553
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,320
 And then I'm going to post to a Facebook post made on the 23rd of October, 2023 by Dave McCarty,

554
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:01,120
 which is a picture of lots of empty carrier bags with the text "I fit all the gifts in my luggage".

555
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,560
 I mean, I think there is also something we might be missing, which there can be like more of a

556
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,520
 gift-giving tradition to guests that you are missing out on. Yeah, there's all sorts of things

557
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:19,760
 where you know I do a talk or a presentation somewhere and I am given like a mug, a branded

558
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,880
 mug or a notebook and a pen and that kind of thing. So I mean, I'm sure there was definitely a lot

559
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,720
 of like here are some Chengdu pics and pieces that we give to all our forum visitors kind of thing.

560
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,480
 Okay, shall we move on to the rest of the Hugo Sub-Committee?

561
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,960
 I think pretty briefly, yeah, because there were a bunch of people on the Hugo Sub-Committee,

562
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,520
 including North Americans and Chinese people. But Dave is the only one who ever made any public

563
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:52,640
 statements about the Hugos. I think Ben was off being co-chair and the other two people were essentially

564
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,960
 doing the administrative work of the Hugo team in North America. And I don't think we got any data

565
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:07,360
 from Chinese fans involved in the team at all. So yeah, so the list of people is Dave McCarty,

566
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:16,880
 Ben Yalo, Amari Rudolf, Diane Lacey, Xi Chen, Zenyu Jiang, Zhou Yao, Tina Wang, Dong Sheng Gu and Bo Pang.

567
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,200
 I will just comment that the actual final stats are titled, 2023 final Hugo stats final Joe

568
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,880
 Doc Doc. So he can shoot more at least one other person read them along with Dave.

569
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,960
 Is this sort of forensic analysis, which is why we keep Liz around? At least it's not called

570
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,960
 final, final, to final, final. Hello everyone, it's John here with a quick pick up before we

571
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,200
 release the episode on the 30th January, which was Tuesday. Worldcon Intellectual Property

572
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,080
 released a statement announcing that Dave McCarty has resigned from the organisation.

573
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:57,760
 Kevin Stanley has resigned as chair of the organisation and Dave McCarty, Chen Xi and Ben Yalo

574
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,240
 have been censured for actions of the Hugo Administration Committee of the Chengdu

575
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:09,200
 Worldcon and Kevin Stanley has been reprimanded for public comments regarding trademarks.

576
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,040
 We plan to get to the trademark debacle next episode. That was a conscious choice because there

577
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,600
 was a lot in this episode and we will discuss the ramifications of the other actions in the

578
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,240
 next episode as well. So a lot of people have wondered what is Glasgow doing about all of this

579
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,600
 as Glasgow 2024 is this year's Worldcon. The first thing is that none of the people who were on the

580
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:39,040
 Hugo Subcommittee in 2023 are working for Glasgow in any capacity. Ben Yalo was but is no longer

581
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,120
 and none of the others were on the stuff as well as far as I know. They have also announced that

582
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,920
 they will release the long list of nomination statistics immediately after the Hugo Awards,

583
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,320
 which is the traditional time it's always been released until this year. It sometimes delayed by

584
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:58,320
 a little bit but not much and that they will announce eligibility decisions and withdrawals

585
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:04,640
 from the award when the ballot is released. I think this is not a bad thing but maybe some of you

586
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,560
 have differing views. Liz this is your cue. Yeah for once I am the person who really hates it

587
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:18,240
 and have strong feelings. I think basically when you are coming up with proposals to try and make

588
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,320
 the Hugo's more transparent which I do approve of I think you should be very careful to do it in

589
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,720
 a way that doesn't make the whole experience less fun for the Hugo finalists and I think this will

590
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,240
 make it significantly less fun. Imagine that in you know they announce all the finalists and at

591
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,520
 the end of this they announced that like Anne Lecky withdrew her name from the ballot for translation

592
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,400
 state and that you know Anne Leenuets and Charlie Jane Anders withdrew for our opinions are correct.

593
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,760
 This is all hypothetical but if I am a finalist at that point well I really don't want is people

594
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,800
 going oh I wonder which podcast was seventh on the ballot and only got on there because

595
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,600
 someone who was higher up withdrew or oh I wonder why you know this thing was disqualified from

596
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,520
 best novel let's have a debate about his eligibility. I don't mind having that debate but I don't

597
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,160
 want to do it on exactly the day they say oh and by the way here are the actual Hugo finalists who

598
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,560
 should be having like their moment in the sum. So I was much more reasonable than I hoped it would

599
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,800
 be. I was hoping for much more vitriol Liz. I mean I'm already quite annoyed by it.

600
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,440
 Is that a vitriolic enough? I find it quite annoying. That's your version of quite annoyed.

601
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,920
 If you don't know Liz well you don't know but I could tell that was Liz being pretty pretty wound

602
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,560
 up about the whole thing. "I am not as quick to anger as Dave McCarty you said and I was kind of

603
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,320
 thinking well John and I are not as quick to anger as Dave McCarty it were a lot more quick to

604
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:49,280
 act of the licks." True. True. I agree that. I agree. I think Glasgow has done a good thing here

605
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:58,640
 in that I do think it would be nice to be able to know the eligibility especially before the voting.

606
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:05,200
 Like it has never quite made sense to me that we don't get the nomination stats before the voting

607
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:12,560
 but I guess you don't want them to affect the voting. Sorry I still think it would impact on

608
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,120
 the eventual voting very significantly if people knew which ones and got lots of nomination.

609
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,800
 A) Because humans are like that they vote for things that they think are popular,

610
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,960
 very well-known, very well-established effect over many years in social sciences but also

611
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:34,560
 people will start their reading from highest nominations first in many cases so that will also

612
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:41,360
 skew the voting. So that is a good argument. There is an argument for releasing the whole

613
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:47,680
 shebang after the ballot is out but before the final result, after the ballot is closed but before

614
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,480
 the final results but then you just have the fact that people will sort of go no such as such one

615
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,840
 but such as such have more nominations. Well you have that you have that anyway. If I'm honest I

616
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,560
 wouldn't release the Hugo stats because I find it really exhausting that the first thing we do as

617
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:07,360
 soon as we know who won is debate all of the framework of that rather than just celebrating

618
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:12,480
 their win which I think is exactly the same problem Liz is having with the joy of the nomination.

619
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,120
 I think part of the reason I'm not angry at this is because the Hugo's already does this so it

620
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:23,200
 doesn't seem like a massive change. Like and actually if we're going to have this argument,

621
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,280
 I think having it after the nominations come out is way better than having it after the winners,

622
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:34,960
 way better. But I am not a Hugo stats wonk. I am also going to channel the younger people who

623
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,000
 are not us apparently but because I'd have said well 20 years ago you might be right about the

624
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,240
 withdrawals and and in not so much an eligibility for the withdrawals but nowadays all sorts of

625
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,160
 people recuse themselves all of the time in public at various different times before during and after

626
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,760
 the nominations are released and it's just not such a big thing as it was 20 or 30 years ago when

627
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,800
 it was pretty rare. I just don't think it I don't think people are really going oh it's the best

628
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:09,520
 fancy that's not answer. From my perspective next year I will know that Hugo Girl is recused and so

629
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:15,200
 if they get enough nominations they will have declined and I'm not sure I mind but I can see

630
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,600
 like I wouldn't have a problem with them releasing the stats like two weeks after nominations. I can

631
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:25,360
 see the point that doing it straight after is a bit mean but then I was not one of I was annoyed

632
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,520
 when Dave said he'd take 90 days but when it looked like it might be a week I was not at all

633
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,760
 concerned so I wouldn't mind there being a week gap between these things a week to let the nominees

634
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,320
 or the winners settle in and then you crack on with the analysis that that that in general that

635
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:46,720
 would seem good from both perspectives to me and I think it would address your concern list but I

636
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,280
 don't know you might hate it. I'm surprising myself by saying this here but I would actually get behind

637
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,160
 the full voting and nominations that's being released like a week after the ceremony because

638
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,760
 you're right there are people who don't like having them there right at the time and in a normal year

639
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,280
 I don't think the week would make much difference except I'd probably be at home and could dig into

640
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,480
 the stats more rather than doing it you know during the Hugo Loser's party but what I can see is that

641
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,960
 if you wait a week or two to release the names of those who declined or deemed ineligible then you

642
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,280
 have to wait open voting because part of the point of this is so that if there has been an error you

643
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,480
 can see it and correct it. I think in general I understand why Glasgow has taken the line they have

644
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,720
 with all of their reaction to this I think one of the lessons that a lot of the people involved

645
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:39,440
 with Chengdu should have learned is that maybe less is more when it comes to commentary and I think

646
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:45,120
 Glasgow waiting to see how certain things pan out before having a response was wise they still

647
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,120
 haven't issued like an explicit statement as far as I know they have they have said how they're

648
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,440
 going to administer the Hugo Awards but they haven't like made an official statement on the

649
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:59,520
 Bruha Ha which might or might not be wise I can see there's a logic to waiting until certain things

650
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,920
 have died down I'm not sure everything has died down yet so I could kind of see that but I think

651
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,360
 in general Glasgow seem to be trying very hard to do the right thing and not add fuel to the fire

652
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:16,000
 and I think in general I applaud that. I feel that as people who do a fortnightly podcast

653
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,960
 this is quite good for us because we I feel this podcast has been very different from the one

654
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:29,080
 that we have recorded today after the Hugo

655
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:50,000
 Awards.

656
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,320
 I yes I think one of the things we'll be picking up in the future episode is some ways forward

657
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,600
 for waspus and what it might want to do about it and but we are not the only people who have thoughts

658
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,080
 on this so things are probably still happening in this space all over the place.

659
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:18,200
 Liz you've probably read a book or something I mean I have um so I'm actually going to nominate

660
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:23,720
 for my pick this week a book that I read in December so it's not super fresh in my memory but

661
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:28,360
 actually it has stuck with me since December and therefore I think it is worth mentioning

662
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:36,120
 so I'm going to pick a book called The Reformetry by Tana Reeve Dew which is a horror novel it's

663
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:43,160
 set in kind of Jim Crow Florida and it's about a young black boy called Robbie you know has like

664
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,440
 a minor altercation with the white youth and ends up being sent to reform school it's it's heavily

665
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:55,960
 based on a real reform school that existed during the 1950s if you've read The Nickel Boys by Colson

666
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:01,160
 Whitehead it's kind of very similar backstory to that and so obviously this was you know a deeply

667
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:07,400
 deeply unpleasant place to be sent but the the twist it do puts on it is that Robbie essentially

668
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:13,080
 can see supernatural figures can see these ghosts or hints as they call it and of course there are

669
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:20,600
 a lot of ghosts in in this school which has been a site of of murders and like other horrific

670
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:26,840
 goings on for many many years and so the book is all about Robbie and his like interactions with

671
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:31,480
 these ghosts and how he sort of survives at reform school but also about his older sister who is

672
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:38,520
 like working to get him out it has a lot of quite dark passages it isn't entirely you know it is

673
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:43,960
 quite a difficult read in places but it's also very uplifting because I think a lot of Robbie's

674
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,760
 seeing ghosts is not a terrible terrible thing seeing ghosts in some ways is something that

675
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,960
 allows him to feel the presence of his dead mother these ghosts are just boys some of them who are

676
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,320
 at the reform school who he forms relationships with and I think the plot strand of the sister

677
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,800
 is also really interesting because she is trying to work to get him out in this system and so she

678
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:10,680
 ends up kind of working again with a lot of kind of white or not black people in the in the south

679
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:16,920
 who all are trying to be allies but often doing it in a very imperfect way she talks to black

680
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,280
 lawyers who are helping her but often they have their own agendas and their own ways they want to

681
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,600
 do things that are not necessarily immediately getting her brother out of reform school I think

682
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:32,200
 it kind of has a really a really nice spin on this story which is a little bit similar to the white

683
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:38,040
 head but balance is really nicely what was it's a very grim story with also the relationship between

684
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:43,880
 families and found families and people in the community and how they pull together or don't

685
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:50,200
 in these situations and I really I really enjoyed it it's also 2023 but and therefore eligible for

686
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:56,840
 the 2024 pukos I have discovered and actually this will come up in my pick but I really enjoy

687
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:03,480
 basically earlier that puts me in the shoes of places that I could only kind of academically

688
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:09,640
 understand but I can't emotionally understand like I understand that Jim Crow Florida was a bad

689
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:15,880
 place but reading a book with characters set in that place will be really interesting because

690
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:21,640
 because it will actually force me to like emotionally relate to it in a way that I might not otherwise

691
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,800
 so I am this is a very interesting pick this is one of the reasons that I like reading books and

692
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:34,120
 consuming other media that was produced in the past because if you go far enough back people

693
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:42,280
 people cannot help but fill everything fill the right of what topic they're writing about

694
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:49,320
 their worldview comes over all of the time in everything in a way that does I find for me I find

695
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:55,400
 that very immersive often or even when it's not immersive it's like oh wow people really

696
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:01,640
 didn't think differently yeah and I would say this one it kind of really does get you emotionally

697
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:08,040
 into that mindset of people who are continually aware of kind of how much a lot of their neighbors

698
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:14,840
 either overtly dislike them or like them up to the point where they are the helpful

699
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:20,120
 helpful black neighbors but they will only go so far yeah it's so it is quite emotional it does get

700
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:24,840
 very tense at times when Robbie is trying to balance his responsibilities to certain

701
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:30,840
 to try and get through things in the reform school but also get justice for the the ghosts of the

702
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:35,560
 boys have been killed there is really quite tense all right Liz I'm buying it all right

703
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:41,880
 I'm already too behind on my pleasure to read all of your picks this year but you know I will

704
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:50,680
 continue trying Liz this book's 182,000 words long is it yeah sorry this likes long books no I don't

705
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:56,520
 like long books I hate long books I often call books way too long Liz loves long books and she

706
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:02,040
 cannot lie you other others can't deny so I remember feeling this book is quite long but I don't

707
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:07,000
 remember it feeling like super duper over long but I also like read it well I was on holiday and so

708
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,840
 you would be times when I would otherwise be just sitting around doing nothing for four hours in an

709
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,960
 airport so I'll pick some short fiction next time how about that John thanks Liz appreciate it let me

710
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,680
 let me help you catch up John because my pick I said I can't really do pick this week because

711
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,640
 we've got no time and literally the only things I've consumed in the last week are printed play games

712
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:33,320
 and back chat about the Hugo Awards and my pick is in the former category here which is a game

713
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:40,280
 called dangerous space and it is a printed play Roland Wright where you have a single sheet of

714
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:45,000
 paper and you play on that but they sell you lots of different sheets of paper for a very

715
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,280
 small amount of money you could get I think the first four and their kind of mix and match this

716
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:58,600
 is a science fiction adventure where you have a a character who is trying to infiltrate a spaceship

717
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:04,040
 and do some things like rescue some people or whatever and things are trying to stop them

718
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,840
 and your your goal is to get out so you can mix and match people and ships I may have mentioned

719
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,000
 dungeon pages last year which is a was a kind of fantasy version of this but this is the science

720
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 fiction version I think we're getting 52 sheets one a one a week for the whole year if we have the

721
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,680
 more expensive version of this which I do I played one really early on when they had not quite

722
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:31,400
 worked out what rules they wanted and in fact due to interventions from various people including

723
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:37,400
 one John Coxon of this parish they massively improved the rule sets so does it's much easier

724
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:43,160
 to play I think than it was when it first came out and it is it is great it takes about 15 or 20

725
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:48,680
 minutes to play a sheet and you can play it perfectly well on the iPad and the whole thing's

726
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:55,640
 fabulous and really very charming in its way and it worked very much money and unfortunately

727
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:04,200
 this is 2024 art so it will be eligible for the you goes in 2025 but dungeon pages is eligible vote

728
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:09,880
 for that which is their fantasy one I have indeed so I also I backed this whole kick star because

729
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:16,280
 I also played dungeon pages it's worth noting that the core set and the year long adventure are

730
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,960
 different products so if you buy the year long adventure you don't get the core set but but

731
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:25,800
 they're like not expensive get both but no it is I do enjoy it and I have already played it so that

732
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,280
 is great from both perspectives I realized I should probably explain what a role on writers

733
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:36,440
 which is it's a game where you roll dice and move around and fill in squares on a map I'm going to

734
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:43,560
 pick uh the kitchen which is I don't know what its eligibility is it was it was premiered at the

735
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:49,560
 BFI London Film Festival in October 2023 but it wasn't released in cinemas uh in the UK until

736
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:57,000
 January 24 it is the directorial debut of Daniel Kluer so you may know him from get out he was the

737
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,320
 lead in get out which is a very good movie which you've heard me talk about before and he has made

738
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:12,760
 a movie about dystopian London in the sort of near future it's kind of about the disconnect

739
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:20,360
 between private landholders and social housing and communities and the money in the land they

740
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:26,440
 occupy I think you could probably pick calls in some of the world building but the central

741
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,880
 emotional journey of the movie is so fantastic and what the movie has to say what the movie has to

742
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:38,120
 say about the way London and other cities are evolving is is so relevant that I am inclined to

743
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:44,440
 uh not dwell on it too much so yeah I really really enjoyed it and then we went to there was an

744
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,520
 exhibition of the costumes from poor things at the Barbican to enter the Barbican which is also

745
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:55,560
 where a lot of the kitchen was filmed especially the bits in the funeral home is probably the best

746
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:00,520
 way to describe it which were filmed in the conservatory at the Barbican so we went and had a look at that

747
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,080
 while we were there for the costumes from poor things and the Barbicans fabulous like it just

748
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:10,920
 looks like the future that was the old thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye for me

749
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:18,840
 and it's goodbye from me

750
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:31,960

751
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,400

752
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:43,000
 Chinese listeners write in yet Chinese written as please write into John and explain it great length
