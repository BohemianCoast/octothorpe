1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 We are recording this as a pick up because something very surprising happened.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:14,720
 It did. We are thrilled and delighted to discover that we are a finalist for the BSFA award for nonfiction,

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:22,760
 which was announced after we recorded our podcast but before it dropped so we're doing an extra special bit.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,120
 And this is it.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:36,360
 And we are nominated in nonfiction alongside Anna McFarland, Joy Sanchez Taylor, Mark Bould, Francesca Barbini and Val Nolan.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,680
 So congratulations to all the other people.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,080
 They have all been nominated for writing and editing books and we have been nominated for this.

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:55,760
 It's fair to say that this is an outlier in BSFA award nonfiction nominations.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,320
 We're quite pleased though.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,120
 Bewilded. Is that the word you use, John? Bewilded.

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:09,640
 I am, I think Bewilded captures, I'm delighted and I'm very excited and also I was quite surprised when we were on the long list.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,360
 So my surprise at being on the short list is quite a lot higher.

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,160
 I remember I told John when he got back from the pub, I said, "Check your email."

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,520
 Liz, Liz is on location and so her audio may be a bit more muffled than usual.

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:34,400
 Yes, we recorded early because I am on holiday and so this is an unplanned emergency octa-thaw session we have convened to say,

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,080
 "Yeah, it's very exciting. I don't think I've ever been nominated for any award."

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,720
 So that's very exciting.

18
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,480
 I think we're the first podcast to be nominated for BSFA award.

19
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,600
 I mean, I haven't taken every single nominee, but I think so.

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:55,080
 And yes, when I looked at the long list, I was like, "Oh, that's a good bunch of serious academic and critical works.

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,760
 We're on the long list."

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
 And I thought there would be a short list of own.

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,720
 And so it's very nice for us to be on it, but I am slightly bewildered, but also pleased that people like it.

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,240
 I'm from John, who is as previously established, John is a novel, so not eligible.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
 Sorry, John.

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,840
 [LAUGHTER]

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,200
 Is John a novel?

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,760
 Yeah, I'm trying to do a running gag.

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,160
 It is. No, yeah, we did decide that I was a novel and therefore...

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,720
 When? When?

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,800
 Last episode, episode before.

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,560
 Oh.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,360
 You probably weren't listening.

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,960
 Shh, don't give away my secrets.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,400
 It's hard to get running jokes going when...

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,080
 Well, let's do it. Remember what we said on the previous episode.

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
 But we'll try. We'll keep going.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,520
 But it does tie into the running joke where Alison doesn't listen to the podcast, so that's good.

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,160
 I listen to the podcast repeatedly.

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,120
 I listen to the podcast where we recorded to that.

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,280
 I listen to the podcast and editing it, and then I sometimes listen to the podcast when it drops.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,400
 And this is very embarrassing, really.

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,080
 Sometimes if I'm feeling a bit sad, I just listen to a back episode of the podcast and it cheers me up.

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,600
 I... I... I'm mine.

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,880
 That's very sweet.

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,000
 You are just callers, Alison.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,800
 It's not the same.

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,280
 Um...

49
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,840
 My colleague, Martin, posted on my Facebook post about this saying,

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,320
 "Did they read your scientific papers?"

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,320
 And I... I think he saw science fiction and thought, "Aha!"

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,840
 But, uh... But even if they had nonfiction,

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,280
 we've managed to go off topic listeners and we've been recording for a grand total of four minutes

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,640
 and fifty seconds.

55
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
 So...

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,840
 Oh no, I've got one more...

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,000
 Because we ought to say extraordinary general meeting.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,440
 What? Just...

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,840
 Just as a complete non-sequitur.

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,920
 Well, this was like it's an emergency opt-of-thought.

61
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,960
 And I was... I wanted to say, yes, it's our extraordinary general meeting.

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,080
 I like to think of it as an emergency holographic octa-thought.

63
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,000
 Anyway, we've recorded enough, Alison.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,320
 Can I be played by Robert Piccardo?

65
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,760
 Well, I have to fight before it.

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,960
 Who's Robert Piccardo?

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,240
 We're making Star Trek jokes now.

68
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,840
 We've played the emergency holographic doctor in Star Trek Voyager.

69
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:18,080
 Thank you very much to BSFA members for nominating us and the voting openers today.

70
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:25,360
 So do go and read those very good works of critical science fiction and vote.

71
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
 Members of the BSFA and members of the Eastcon are eligible to vote

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,800
 in the BSFA awards and the awards are going to be given out at Eastcon at the award ceremony.

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
 Yeah, and it's a good fiction shortlist, so you should also go out and read as much of that as you

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
 can before the voting deadline.

75
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,480
 Yeah, lots of great fiction on there.

76
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,960
 Yes, agreed.

77
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,920
 I'd love to say it includes books I've read, but I'm not sure it does.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,480
 This was the octa-thought podcast drop-in.

79
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,200
 Yeah, please chop most of the nonsense out of that.

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,520
 There was a lot of nonsense about fashion, so on.

81
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:18,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 52nd episode of Octa-Thorp, a podcast for science fiction and

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,600
 science fiction fandom.

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
 This episode is coming to you on the 3rd of March 2022.

84
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
 I'm John Coxon.

85
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
 I'm Alison Scott.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,160
 And I'm Liz Batty.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:36,480
 And today we have a letter of comment all about boxing from Christopher J Garcia.

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,760
 I feel we brought this one on ourselves, really.

89
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,240
 Yes, basically there are lots of boxing organisations.

90
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,640
 If you'd like to know more, talk to Chris about that.

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:55,200
 He does also say that he likes the games Hugo and he talked a little bit about short films and

92
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,000
 says he would like to see more of those on the ballot, but they don't end up on the ballot.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,440
 So that's sad.

94
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,040
 He makes a recommendation for a short film called The Fantastical Flying Books of Mr Morris Lessmore,

95
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,000
 and we will link to it in the show notes.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,960
 We will.

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,760
 I think I have that.

98
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,720
 I think it was a free film on iTunes at one point in the days when you still bought

99
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,760
 media for it to be on your computer, as opposed to just streaming everything from some sort of

100
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,800
 amorphous mainframe somewhere. But he is also on YouTube, so you know, now I can stream it

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
 from some amorphous mainframe somewhere.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,920
 Hoorah!

103
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,640
 Thank you very much for writing in Chris.

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
 Thank you, Chris, for writing in.

105
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,520
 We think we should also add that he did explain all the boxing organisations by

106
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,800
 analogies to science fiction and fantasy awards, which is obviously the best way to explain

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
 things to this podcast.

108
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
 So basically, for explaining anything to us, you have to do it in terms of science fiction awards.

109
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,960
 Yes.

110
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,560
 How would you explain the hugas in terms of science fiction awards?

111
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,760
 Recursively.

112
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,840
 Yeah, you'd have to shove them. Never mind.

113
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,200
 Peter Sullivan emailed us to tell us where to find the Christmas TAF website,

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,840
 and we'll put that in the show notes.

115
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,720
 And Ming wrote on Facebook to ask how I would want to have without getting the most votes

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,240
 is this some sort of "fanish first past the post" system.

117
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,840
 And Alison commented saying that it's much more complicated than that, which it is.

118
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,800
 Basically, there were four people in that race, and in order to win, you had to have at least

119
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,640
 20% of the vote on either side of the Atlantic.

120
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,360
 So you had to have 20% of the US and Canadian votes and 20% of the European votes.

121
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,440
 And I was the only candidate that got 20% of the votes on both sides of the Atlantic.

122
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,400
 So Liam Proven and Graham Charnock got more votes than me but did not get.

123
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,920
 The right number of votes on both sides.

124
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,760
 I had not realised until I went to find that for Ming that in fact,

125
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,480
 Liam got vastly more votes than you.

126
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,960
 Just enormous numbers more votes than you would have.

127
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,440
 I was only shy on the US side by about one or two votes, not for many.

128
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,840
 So we're very sorry, Liam.

129
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,600
 But look, look, look what a great fan John has turned out to be wearing.

130
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,160
 You just, you know, pissed off to Prague and have babies.

131
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,760
 Just the one baby, actually.

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,600
 I was gonna say plural.

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
 No, Liam needed one more North American vote.

134
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,320
 And I believe I'm right in saying, I might be wrong about this,

135
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,480
 but I'm pretty sure at the time someone noticed that one of Liam's North American nominators

136
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,800
 does not appear on the list of people he voted.

137
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,640
 So, you know, when you're running for TAF, get your nominators to vote for you.

138
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,640
 That is a wise campaign strategy, regardless of opinions or self promotion.

139
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,800
 I should say I have voted for Anders for TAF this week and would suggest that all of you do the same.

140
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
 I have also already voted for fear.

141
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
 I got my very nice and early.

142
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
 So yes, recommended.

143
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,720
 Yeah, so do vote for TAF this week.

144
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,320
 Remember your second and third and fourth place votes, because all the candidates are very good.

145
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,320
 The rules have since been changed such that the 20% rule is only applied when there are

146
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,800
 three remaining candidates on the ballot.

147
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,760
 And so if that rule had been in place in that form when I was running for TAF,

148
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,280
 I suspect I would not have won, because I suspect Liam would have achieved 20% in the second round

149
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,920
 of vote allocation, and Liam would have gone.

150
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,440
 But, you know, these things happen.

151
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
 Liam could just stand again at some point.

152
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,040
 Liam, if you're listening, which I know you're not, run for TAF.

153
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,400
 Yeah, we can discuss separately the practicalities of running for fan fans when you have small children.

154
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,320
 There was a tweet from Peter Sullivan as well that said for a really serious challenge,

155
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,160
 try and get a five-way tie in TAF and get all of them to meet the 20% rule on each side of the Atlantic.

156
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,880
 That's not so much a challenge as a fix.

157
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,640
 And actually, I'm not sure how that would intersect with the 20% rule doesn't get applied until

158
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,960
 there are three candidates, because if no one's eliminated, how does that work?

159
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,640
 I assume it's solved by a football match in the gardens of the Birmingham Hilton Metropole,

160
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
 and if you know otherwise, you should write in.

161
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,680
 We also heard from Duncan McGregor, who wrote on the subject of the Games Hugo,

162
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,040
 "In the grimdark future of the Hugo Awards, they are all games, and I desperately tried

163
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,200
 to decide whether to vote for the latest Tilaris expansion, thousand-year vampire,

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
 or the next Warhammer 40,000 Tyranid Codex or something.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,040
 This seems tricky. Thanks for that vision of Hell, Octorp."

166
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,200
 And, firstly, you're welcome.

167
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200
 I responded saying Necrons all the way, and Duncan revealed that he has

168
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,000
 a Necron Christmas jumper, which is 10 out of 10, and should definitely win some sort of Hugo.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,800
 "For the benefit of our less connected listeners, what's a Necron?"

170
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:55,360
 It's a race of beings whose souls were harvested by the Catan and distilled into robots to do their

171
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,000
 bidding, and they worship a god who's probably buried on Mars.

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,560
 And so the Adeptus mechanic has probably actually worked,

173
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,320
 worshiping the same god, and that could be a bit tricky if it ever wakes up.

174
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
 "In what universe?"

175
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
 "One forty thousand."

176
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320
 So they're basically sort of, I've just saw some good-ling,

177
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,040
 skeletal robot zombie warriors.

178
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,480
 "Yeah."

179
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,840
 "And maybe Alice and Chadros won with a Christmas hat on?"

180
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,320
 "What we need is a Necron with an Octo-Thought Christmas jumper."

181
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,880
 "Ooh."

182
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,560
 "We do need that."

183
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,040
 "I will do that."

184
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,280
 "I used to play Necrons when I was a nipper."

185
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,960
 "Saying ever more elaborate fanart challenges for Alice and tune in next fortnight to see

186
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,920
 what we come up with."

187
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,200
 "I love the fact that we're talking about Christmas jumpers in February,

188
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,800
 rather than say October when it's commercially viable."

189
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,320
 "Ock to Thorpe, the podcast of commercial viability."

190
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,320
 "Readers, if you want, you can email me and Liz and place bets on what we can make Alice

191
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,400
 and draw, and we will try and get her to draw it without telling her what it is,

192
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
 and that will be very fun for everyone."

193
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,200
 So if you have any ideas, do get in touch, and we can have some fun.

194
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,640
 Sorry, Alice, in advance.

195
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,120
 "How are they going to get touched?"

196
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,800
 "They're going to email me or discord me. I'm around."

197
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,040
 "Yeah, this is not- this is the sort of thing that does not work when I podcast scales to people

198
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,320
 who do not know us personally. Then we have Twitter accounts, you can tweet us."

199
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,960
 "You can probably DM the ock to Thorpe account, because I'm not sure if Alice and remembers password."

200
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,640
 "I get forwards, though."

201
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,800
 And finally, we heard from Laurie from the Hugo Girl podcast,

202
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,000
 whose To Be Redpile has been sidelined because I mentioned six weeks on last

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,680
 Friday's podcast, and sorry, Laurie. I hope you like it.

204
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,800
 I found out that Liz and Alice and have not read it, and so at some point in the future,

205
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,680
 I was about to say near future, but you know, what even is time?

206
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,840
 I will be encouraging them both to read it so we can discuss it on the cast.

207
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,120
 So keep your ears peeled.

208
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,880
 And also be cool if Hugo Girl discussed it on their podcast,

209
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,280
 because it did end up as a Hugo finalist.

210
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,360
 On the subject of Hugo Award finalists, the deadline for nominating for you goes is the 15th

211
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,480
 of March, which is just under two weeks from when this episode will drop.

212
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,720
 So you should all nominate things.

213
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,640
 Nominate the things you like.

214
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,840
 I will be nominating things.

215
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,520
 I like one of which we may be discussing later.

216
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,560
 Ooh, foreshadowing.

217
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,360
 We put a list of some of the things we like on the fan categories in Corlobulot's blog.

218
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,760
 So for instance, I will be nominating the fabulous banana wings.

219
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,400
 I will be nominating the excellent Sumason.

220
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,960
 I will be nominating the incomparable Become the Teapot,

221
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,000
 and I will be enthusiastically getting behind.

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,120
 It's Banya.

223
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,600
 I'll be nominating Sandra Bond.

224
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,760
 So those are, for examples of fans I will be nominating in different categories.

225
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,040
 So yeah, do get on and nominate.

226
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,800
 Who are you nominating, peeps?

227
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,160
 Well, I'm definitely nominating Sandra Bond now that you mention it.

228
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,480
 And I'm nominating Claire Brawley and I'm nominating Mark Plummer.

229
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,600
 I am going to nominate for fan artists, as well as the people on that list.

230
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,920
 I'm going to nominate Olarika O'Brien.

231
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,640
 And then, like science fiction books, I'm definitely nominating the actual star,

232
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,160
 but I still haven't read enough science fiction books published in 2021

233
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
 to fill up my nomination categories.

234
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,040
 I am going to nominate the Unraveling by Benjamin Rosenbaum,

235
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,520
 which is a 2021 novel.

236
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,960
 I am going to nominate something from Mythic Quest,

237
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,920
 and I am torn as to whether nominate to nominate,

238
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,080
 like the whole of season two in best romantic presentation, long form,

239
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,720
 or whether to pick my favorite episode of season two,

240
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,080
 or whether to pick the episode of season two,

241
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,920
 I think everyone else is going to nominate.

242
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,520
 So I have to do some thinking there.

243
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,520
 Because my assumption is if there is one episode which appeals to Hugo Voters,

244
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,360
 it will be the one about young Carl Longbottom becoming a writer.

245
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,600
 Oh, is Alison's gone fingers in her ears because she hasn't seen it yet?

246
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,200
 It's not really a spoiler though.

247
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,040
 No, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

248
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,320
 I didn't hear it anyway.

249
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,720
 So I think I'll probably nominate that episode, yes.

250
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,280
 But I did also like the one where they have to decide if they're wolves or sheep.

251
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,400
 That was great.

252
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,360
 And it's like a bottle episode all in one episode,

253
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
 and it is a great episode.

254
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,640
 But maybe not the one which will appeal most of the Hugo Voters.

255
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,600
 Maybe not.

256
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,960
 It seems likely that if Mythic Quest got a Hugo finalist spot,

257
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,920
 they'd be quite excited about that given that they've got a nebula in their show, wouldn't it?

258
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,480
 Possibly.

259
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,400
 Oh, I just want to tell you, John, while I was looking up the name of the episode of Mythic Quest,

260
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,240
 you can apparently now read the tears of the Inarron story.

261
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,800
 It's presumably terrible, so I might have to look at that.

262
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,520
 [Music]

263
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,280
 Ch icon are planning to be hybrid, but the exact details of that haven't been announced yet.

264
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,520
 They also haven't announced things like platforms,

265
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,720
 and whether they have a virtual membership or any of that sort of stuff.

266
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,520
 They have, however, appointed a virtual program lead, which is Eddie Louise.

267
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,760
 I had a chat with Eddie a couple of weeks ago that was very interesting.

268
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:38,400
 Eddie led tech for both the firecons, so she has very good chops here,

269
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,560
 and she also has been involved in the nebula weekend.

270
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,920
 That's where her background in running virtual events are from,

271
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,120
 that she's very excited about the possibilities of virtual,

272
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
 and all the other decisions have been made.

273
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,360
 She's kind of talking about all the sorts of highly engaged virtual programming that

274
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,240
 we try to do, the sort of things we try to do with punctuation,

275
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
 and the sort of things that I particularly like.

276
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,360
 So I'm quite excited about that.

277
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,800
 I ended up talking to her because I had volunteered help on fanzine lounge,

278
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:19,280
 and if I'm not going to be at Ch icon, then I'm very happy to kind of run the virtual

279
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,400
 fanzine lounge for them.

280
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
 If I am at Ch icon, I guess I'm going to be doing some stuff on fanzine lounge.

281
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,840
 And I've promised a note on what a virtual fanzine lounge might look like,

282
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,120
 which I very much need to get on and do.

283
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,920
 I will be going to try conz hybrid stuff if there is any.

284
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:43,200
 I have a Ch icon supporting membership, so hopefully there will be something included in that.

285
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,320
 I quite enjoyed the discount virtual stuff, but I have to be honest,

286
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,240
 probably not enough to pay an uplift to a virtual membership,

287
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
 if it's more than a supporting membership.

288
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,240
 So I do kind of hope.

289
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,480
 It was only $25.

290
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,560
 I didn't get $25 of value out of it, and so if it costs that much again, I would not pay it.

291
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,200
 I don't think.

292
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:16,000
 And I don't really see what the 25-pound boards, or $25 boards, but maybe I'm just not thinking

293
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,560
 about it properly.

294
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,560
 It was mainly the right podcast for this argument, but I mean, you could say,

295
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,960
 what does $50 for a 14 membership get you?

296
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,920
 It essentially gets you at this point, sort of voting rights, nominating rights,

297
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:35,840
 site-section voting rights, and the Hugo packet, which is all free stuff donated by the people who

298
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,640
 made that stuff.

299
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,840
 So I can see an additional monetary cost could be involved in the virtual program,

300
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,240
 but I think the $50 you pay for a supporting membership,

301
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,480
 if I'm trying to put a dollar value on what I get out of it, it's like,

302
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,920
 I'm sure you could actually do a feasible sporting membership for much lower,

303
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,040
 if it weren't for the fact that you have to set it to a certain number because of the

304
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,600
 multiple of supporting rate conversion or whatever it is.

305
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,400
 I take your point, but the number of books I read in the last Hugo voter packet,

306
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,120
 I think I thought it was well worth the money.

307
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,160
 Yeah.

308
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,800
 So I appreciate it doesn't cost the worldcon that much to do it,

309
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,960
 but I definitely get that much value out of it.

310
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,720
 I guess I'm drawing my argument a bit here, which is unhelpful.

311
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,160
 But no, I mean, and I'm sure lots of other people did get the value.

312
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,880
 I'm just not sure I did really, but that's fine.

313
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
 Different strokes.

314
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,480
 The one of the things people point to as the cost of the virtual membership

315
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,880
 is actually the stream out and stream in costs of the physical convention.

316
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,720
 And I am beginning to argue more forcefully that the virtual members shouldn't be picking up

317
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,240
 those costs, that it's actually part of the cost of putting on the convention,

318
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
 or they shouldn't be picking up all of those costs.

319
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,360
 So, and certainly that was the argument is that you have to have better IT

320
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,240
 in lots of different ways to do the stream out and stream in,

321
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,080
 than you do just to have people in their own homes using their own equipment.

322
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:14,320
 One of the things that we're going to discuss today is what you want from an

323
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,400
 Eastercon bid. So those who are listening in the states, or those who are more familiar with

324
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,600
 Worldcons, will be familiar perhaps with the thing called the Fanaging Position,

325
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,840
 which is a kind of standard list of questions that sent out to Worldcon bids.

326
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,840
 But we don't really have an equivalent for Eastercon.

327
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:38,080
 And I was curious what Alison and Liz and the listenership that you thought are the key bits

328
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,120
 of information you would like to know about an Eastercon when you're deciding whether or not

329
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:50,160
 to cast a vote for it. So, full disclosure, Alison and I obviously have horses in this race,

330
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,480
 because we are both involved with upcoming Eastercon bids. Liz is currently listening,

331
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,560
 you can't see, but she has leaned back. Her hands are on the back of her head, her elbows are wide,

332
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,760
 and she looks like the most relaxed person in the world, and I'm very envious of her.

333
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,200
 She looks so smug listeners, you don't understand, so smug.

334
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,480
 She does look like a person who is not bidding for an Eastercon and feels like she might have

335
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,360
 dodged a bullet. And I think as I feel like somebody who actually threw myself in front of the bullet.

336
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:30,080
 So Liz, do you want to start? Do you want to kick things off with what you look for in an Eastercon bid?

337
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,000
 Can I put in something that's only slightly relevant here, which is that in a search to find

338
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,760
 out what other people put into their Eastercon presentations, John asked for previous Eastercon

339
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,520
 material, and so far that has turned up as well as some serious presentations. The bid video for

340
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,520
 the 1988 Eastercon, which is hilarious, and which I suppose that's no reason I couldn't put on

341
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,440
 YouTube for the delight of an edification of what to thought viewers. Well, and I just really liked

342
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,400
 that because it was nice to see what Eastercon bidding was like for the year I was born. Yeah.

343
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:14,080
 Oh, it was the year before you were born. This was done for 1987, but it also turned up like a

344
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:23,200
 kind of script with timing details for the second Jersey bid. What do I look for in an Eastercon

345
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,800
 bid presentation? I like to know who's doing it and why they might be good at the jobs they have

346
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,560
 chosen to do. I like to know where you're having it and why it is a good place to have it,

347
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,720
 and if there are significant drawbacks to that location that you can't avoid, it's nice to know

348
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,520
 those upfront as well. I don't think I want you to necessarily show me that you have a fully

349
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,800
 fledged code of conduct and harassment policy and access policy, but I want you to tell me that

350
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,400
 you are committed to having those things. And then I would like to know why your Eastercon

351
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,120
 will be particularly fun. Essentially the way I'd like to know what your Eastercon is going to focus

352
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,400
 on, what you think is a key part of Eastercons, and what you're going to do to make that happen.

353
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
 Oh yeah, and I think also if you're planning to ditch any massively significant bits of

354
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,920
 Eastercon tradition, it's possibly good to mention those in the bid session. Like if you're not

355
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,360
 planning to have any guests of honor, you should probably tell us. If you're planning to do it in

356
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,720
 a campsite or butlins, then you should tell us. And also you should be short and sweet because

357
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,800
 it's Sunday morning and I'm probably hungover. That, yep, that's all very fair, brilliant stuff.

358
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,120
 You've got to disagree with me now, John, are the podcast no fun?

359
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,680
 Oh, I'm going to let Alison go next. Children's agree with me.

360
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,960
 I think Liz has covered most of the main things, but under who's running it and why,

361
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,720
 you do kind of want to get a sense A that they're covering the set of work that has to be done.

362
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,720
 There's something about financial probity because there's some assumptions about

363
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:09,280
 Eastercons being not for profit and the committee not benefiting from it. And it's all very assumed,

364
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,680
 but I think, and we tend not to say it out loud, but one of the things we do is we look at the

365
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,160
 people who were running it. And if it wasn't a group of people that were already in that network,

366
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:26,000
 I think people probably will be saying, well, why you, what is it that you're hoping to get out of it?

367
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,600
 Something about Eastercon philosophy, maybe, but I don't know if people really care. People just

368
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,440
 want to know that it's going to be in a nice place and they'll have a good weekend. If you're

369
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,240
 going to be not on the UK mainland, I think you probably need to say quite a lot about why.

370
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,960
 So one of the things that they say in the Worldcon vanishing position is for what dates are you bidding?

371
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,840
 And generally speaking, for Eastercons, we're bidding for Easter, but it's not absolutely guaranteed

372
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,920
 that will always be the case. There's a reason why Worldcon moved off the Labor Day weekend,

373
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,000
 and those reasons also pertain to Eastercons, to some extent, which is if you could only get the

374
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,720
 site you want some other time, people might do that. If you actually go and look at the

375
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:14,400
 vanishing position, it's all full of things like what's the nearest airport to your city and what

376
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,560
 the airfare is like? And I'm like, oh, for God's sake, can people not use Google?

377
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,080
 I think that probably is covered a little bit under Liz's Eastercon traditions,

378
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:32,000
 proviso. But yes, no, I think that is a good point. The one thing that stands out to me that neither

379
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,480
 of you have mentioned is price. I like knowing what the price of the membership is and what the price

380
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,320
 of the hotel is. One of the reasons why, although I know going back to your point about the vanishing

381
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,400
 position and flights to nearby cities, I think having an idea of how much it costs to get to

382
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,480
 the location is good, which kind of folds into your point about offshore Eastercons as well.

383
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,200
 I haven't not been to any of these concerts they started, so I've never been put off by the price,

384
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,120
 but I think it's something I look for. It does, but if we were to decide to hold Eastercon and say

385
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,840
 Bristol or Aberdeen, I think there would be quite a lot of criticism about the cost of getting there

386
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,880
 from London and I think there probably shouldn't be, you know, or getting to Bristol from Glasgow

387
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:24,160
 or whatever. So, you know, I think it's right that the Eastercons should move around the UK.

388
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,360
 You could obviously say, "Oh, it's cheapest for everyone on average if we always hold it

389
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,600
 in the Hilton Metropolitan Birmingham, plus it has an excellent garden suitable for football matches."

390
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,760
 I think you've got a counterbalance, considerations of cost with the considerations of access,

391
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,320
 and I for one would love to see, for instance, an Eastercon held in Cardiff or in Northern Ireland,

392
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,120
 and although they would be more difficult to get to than some other venues, I still think

393
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,120
 that would be fabulous. So, yeah. So, there's a thing about beer as well, which is that if you

394
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,280
 do not say anything about beer, people will ask you if you're going to have real ale, and

395
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:07,760
 we have just discovered that at least one recent Eastercon covered its entire food and drink spend

396
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:17,200
 requirement on taking over the real ale bar over the weekend. So, so it's not marginal. We start

397
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,160
 to get people going, "Oh, the beer thing is marginal," but it probably isn't marginal. There's a real

398
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,160
 question of whether if you don't have beer at your convention, you could possibly satisfy the

399
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,440
 square the circle of making the convention work. And there's a load of questions that people will

400
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,640
 ask you whether you say anything about them or not. You should probably say something about

401
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,920
 children and how you're going to deal with them, because although there are not that many children

402
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:49,360
 at Eastercon, it's really important that people with kids can still get involved in Eastercon and

403
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,640
 are not expected to just leave their children with their other partner for the weekend and go

404
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,280
 off and have a jolly. I would also say that at the moment, I would probably like to know what your

405
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:08,000
 plans are for virtual and/or hybrid conventions. Should you need to go for that? But also to say

406
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,680
 that there's another thing I judge off your Eastercon bid presentation, which is not necessarily

407
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:19,440
 the content of your presentation, but can your bid team put together a good presentation and

408
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,400
 present it and, you know, have slides and do it all in the right order? Because if you can't manage

409
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,320
 to put together a five-minute presentation to tell me what you're going to do in two years time,

410
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,320
 then I have a lot less faith that you will actually put together a good convention.

411
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,480
 I guess fair. Yeah, I remember when the Hugo Loser's party was being run by the subsequent

412
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:47,200
 WELKON, somebody explaining to me that it was the first major event that the winning team

413
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,120
 organised, and it was used as a sort of prior warning by the Shadowy Cabal that actually runs

414
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,560
 the WELKON, because if the sitting WELKON couldn't manage to run a party, then you knew there was

415
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,800
 a major problem. And the bid presentations like that, you want to see that they could do a bid

416
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,720
 presentation. One thing that Liz touched on that we haven't talked much about is obviously

417
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,360
 access policies are important, but discussions of the accessibility of the venue. And Liz, you

418
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,000
 did say like, where is it? But obviously, I just want to highlight that that doesn't just cover

419
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,560
 the geography, but it covers kind of whereabouts in the city, is it, and how easy is it to

420
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:30,480
 navigate? Is it two minutes walk from the station, or is it all sedatively on a motorway junction

421
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:42,960
 miles away from anywhere? Liz, do you want to pick first? So my pick is Deep Breath,

422
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,920
 the 50-year mission, Colon, the next 25 years Colon, from the next generation to JJ Abrams,

423
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,960
 Colon, the complete uncensored and unauthorized oral history of Star Trek. It's a very long title

424
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,720
 for a very long book, but it is exactly what it says on the tin, basically. It goes from Star Trek

425
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,800
 next generation to the JJ Abrams films, and it's all done by essentially accepting interviews of

426
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:13,200
 nearly all the major players in the entire franchise. So it's basically a deeply nerdy book for people

427
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,320
 who like Star Trek. If you want to hear a lot from the writers, and very candidly about what

428
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,480
 they thought went well, what they thought went badly, they interviewed a lot of people who

429
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,640
 spent a short time working on Star Trek, and then left the interview everyone through Deep Space

430
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,400
 Nine, an enterprise and Voyager who were quite candid about what worked, what didn't, what kind

431
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,360
 of the network wanted them to be, and also at the end of enterprise, how they really thought they

432
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,760
 were finding their feet, just as they got cancelled, and then it goes on, and you know,

433
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,240
 just to say about the JJ Abrams films would also talk about kind of all the different attempts to

434
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,720
 reboot it in the intervening time, like different film proposals and so on. So yeah, it's a very

435
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,480
 long book, I haven't read it in one city, but I sort of been dipping in and out of different

436
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,480
 chapters and reading about the different sections, and yeah, it's made me want to go and watch

437
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,760
 some Star Trek again. Excellent stuff. I am sort of in the middle of a original series watch, but because

438
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,080
 my television platform of choice merges all of the videos I'm currently watching from every service,

439
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,840
 except Netflix, so I forget the things I'm watching on Netflix, and then I forget to go back to them.

440
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,000
 So I've been about halfway through series three for about a year, so yeah, I need to go back.

441
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,800
 I particularly like the episode where Kirk punches a thing and gets it sorted, and I dislike the

442
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,880
 episode where Kirk is a bit sexist, but the lady wanted it really.

443
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,120
 I bought the whole of the original series planning to do a rewatch, and I managed about three and

444
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,680
 half episodes. I've been a bit glib there, but I do find the approach to gender of some of the

445
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:54,240
 episodes is, oh my goodness, it's hard. This was a very progressive show of its time. Like the one

446
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,960
 where Kirk is accused of sexual impropriety, and the solution is, oh yeah, but he wouldn't do that,

447
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,080
 because we know him, and he's good. And it's like, oh no, that's not how it works. And I get that

448
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,000
 it was a different time, but blimey. It's just hard to watch. There's some interesting and,

449
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,640
 you know, occasionally, hair-raising stuff about this in the 50th mission. I should say there is a

450
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,760
 previous book in this series. One of the reasons it's got so many colons is there is a first 25

451
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,800
 years book, which is all about the original series and the original films. But yes, there are some

452
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:34,320
 stories of the costuming of who can we bring into this show to bring us in some sexy babes.

453
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,480
 And there is a constant thread going through of how they complain about they can never find any

454
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,040
 stunningly attractive women who can act, because stunningly attractive women are never able to act

455
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,360
 or something. And it's very strange. So you can see some of the behind-the-scenes stuff that

456
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,600
 was still going on, and I guess next generation is going back to the mid-80s when they were starting

457
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,240
 up. But you can see some of that. But it's also quite interesting to hear about when they got

458
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,520
 Voyager and they were determined to have a female captain and they cast the original,

459
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,640
 an original actress who they realised very quickly was completely wrong for it, and she realised as

460
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,280
 well. This was completely not what she wanted to do, and then they just kind of flipped it entirely

461
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:17,360
 and put a new actress in there. Hmm, interesting. I feel that we need phonetic punctuation for

462
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,480
 titles like that. We did have big phonetic punctuation. Liz said colon a lot. Yeah, but like, colon.

463
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:32,880
 *gibberish* Sorry, can't do it. *bop* *bop* Sorry, did I burst any ones and he had drops?

464
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,120
 *laughs* I don't know where to go with this. You just made some funny beeping.

465
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,640
 Oh, can I, can I give you one quote that I highlighted from this book?

466
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,920
 Yep, yep, yep, go for it.

467
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,240
 Uh, it's about, you know, enterprise being constantly says, in England they loved enterprise. I've

468
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,280
 done a couple of conventions there, and people are like, 'why did you cancel it?' They were

469
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,520
 baffled because they were successful and popular there. What's here? English people

470
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,960
 write in and tell me if this was you telling one of the enterprise producers how much England

471
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,880
 loved enterprise because I do not remember that being the case. If you go to a convention that's

472
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,440
 about a thing in Britain and you're a representative of that thing, then all the people who like that

473
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,800
 thing will come up to you and tell you how marvellous that thing was, and all the people who didn't

474
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,960
 like that thing will sit in the bar drinking pints or not come to the convention.

475
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,080
 That's how Britain works. I guess, I suspect in America people who didn't like your show and

476
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,760
 more likely to tell you so at a convention, but that's not going to happen here.

477
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,720
 That could be true. Interesting point. I also at some point need to finish next generation

478
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,080
 because I've been about two episodes into series seven for ages.

479
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,840
 I am in television bankruptcy. However, I have watched one more episode of the Expanse since we

480
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:52,880
 last spoke. So obviously, the reason we do picks is to tell you all about the great things in the

481
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,760
 community that are happening and encourage you to go and experience them. So naturally,

482
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,520
 in line with this, I'm picking a decade old out-of-print card game called Android Netrunner.

483
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:11,040
 Android Netrunner was a game published by Fantasyfly Games between about 2012 and about 2017.

484
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,240
 It was designed by a man called Lucas Litzinger and it's based on a Richard Garfield design

485
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,520
 that was originally published by Wizards of the Coast in the mid-90s, just after Magic the Gathering.

486
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,080
 For those who don't know, Richard Garfield designed Magic the Gathering and so is well

487
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,840
 regarded in the space of card games as a result. Netrunner is a particularly interesting game because

488
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:40,640
 firstly, it's set in a cyberpunk dystopia, which I prefer to a fantasy setting because I prefer

489
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:48,400
 lasers and robots to magic. And because it's asymmetrical, so you are two players and one player

490
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,120
 plays the corporation and you are protecting your servers with ICE, which is intrusion countermeasure

491
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:01,360
 electronics from the Neuromancer terminology, and the other player is running on your servers,

492
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,880
 trying to get past your ICE and into the servers. The twist is the corporation installs all of

493
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,000
 their cards face down, so the runner doesn't know what they are until they encounter the card.

494
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,640
 And so there's a real bluffing element to the game, which is unusual in that kind of competitive

495
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,280
 card game. Not many games have that bluffing angle. And so it was really good. It was good as well

496
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,760
 because it wasn't collectible. It was, well, they call it a living card game, which is a thing

497
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,200
 fantasyfly I've come up with. And basically, if you buy a pack of cards, you know what's in the

498
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,880
 pack of cards. And for those of you who are not super into games, you might be like, surely that

499
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,400
 makes sense, but you would be surprised how many popular card games do not follow this simple model.

500
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,000
 So this would be like when you buy a pack of football cards, you could like choose which

501
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,400
 teams cards you wanted, or you could buy the cards that you didn't have yet for your

502
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,960
 Phonini album rather than spending many hours on the playground trying to swap.

503
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,400
 Exactly. Where would be the fun in that?

504
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,840
 Ah, well, the fun is in the game rather than the collecting.

505
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:09,520
 Pretty sure the fun is in the loot boxes. Right. So, um, Netrunner was fantastic,

506
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,880
 and I loved it for a long time and I've still got a bunch of cards, not all of them. I sold a lot,

507
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,720
 but I still got enough cards. I've made some decks. I'm very happy with playing it recently

508
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,440
 in Casa, Cox and Sheriff, and it has been great. The man who designed the modernized version of Netrunner

509
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,640
 went on to make a game called Star Wars Destiny. The problem is that these games went away,

510
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,480
 and it's very sad. But then there was a game called Arkham Horror the Card Game.

511
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,000
 And Arkham Horror the Card Game is interesting because it borrows things from the Netrunner core

512
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:50,400
 design, the kind of DNA of Netrunner lives on, uh, through Arkham. But me and España have been

513
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,920
 playing Netrunner with some of my pickup decks, and they are enormously good fun.

514
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,400
 I've never played another card game like it, which has that kind of bluffing element and that kind of

515
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
 uncertainty if you're playing the runner of not quite knowing what's going to hit you,

516
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,160
 when you're trying to get into the opponent's servers. And so I really do,

517
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,320
 I really do think Netrunner was fantastic. And I'm very sad that it went away. Yes,

518
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,760
 if you find it on eBay, it's good Android Netrunner. Highly recommend. And the artwork's amazing.

519
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,240
 Like on the cards, the arts just so pretty. Mark's going to write, you know.

520
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,880
 I hope so. There's a point where you got to Arkham Horror and I was like, oh no, he's just

521
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,800
 put it around to Arkham Horror now. But if anyone's ever in my house, I have some decks and we could

522
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,720
 play. Which house would that be? My new house or my old house, but basically the house in which

523
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,040
 I am in. Don't go to a house I don't live in. I'm going to turn it but John's old house and

524
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,920
 knock on the door and be like, Netrunner and the new occupants are going to be like,

525
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,360
 actually the previous occupants of this house did also play Netrunner because that was one of

526
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,600
 the things we chat to them about when we were looking around.

527
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:00,800
 That is interesting. We were actually recording six days early, which is only like eight days

528
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,640
 after we last recorded, as a result of which I don't really have a new and interesting genre

529
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,560
 pick for you. However, so my pick is, an anti-productivity book called I Didn't Do the Thing Today by

530
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:23,120
 Madeline Dor, which is all about how you shouldn't worry so much about fitting the things you do into

531
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,320
 arbitrary structures of what needs to be done on a particular date, like having a pick ready

532
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,200
 for octa thought recording, but instead you should find where the mood takes you and build your

533
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:42,080
 creative and professional structures around what is exciting and speaks to you at any given time.

534
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,440
 And there are much more important things in life than checking a box like having a pick ready for

535
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,320
 octa thought. So it's pretty good. I've been listening to it as an audio book. It is full of quotes from

536
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,200
 other productivity writers. So if you are a productivity junkie like I am, you will be familiar with a

537
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:08,080
 lot of what is in this book, but it's very soothing. It's full of stuff that is very reassuring about

538
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:14,560
 the fact that it is 4.30 in the afternoon and you have only done one of the 19 things on your

539
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,040
 to-do list today. And in particular, you've not done any of the things that had to happen today.

540
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,280
 Do I sound a bit worried? But I'm soothed because this book has reassured me that my creativity is

541
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,480
 more important. Yeah, I am not sure my employers would agree that it's okay if I have today thing

542
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,200
 on my to-do list by 4.30 because my creativity has been fulfilled. She does explain how to do

543
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,040
 some stuff as well. Unfortunately, creative fulfilment is not the thing I require in my

544
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,520
 employment. Just in case you are someone to whom Alison currently owns work, the address of the

545
00:40:47,520 --> 00:41:01,520
 author will be in the show-pounds. So, listeners, we're going to talk about a book that we all read.

546
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,040
 Yeah, we've all read it really recently and it is a book that you can nominate for The Hugo.

547
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,560
 If you like, this basically never happens.

548
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,280
 Oct-thought book club. Oct-thought book club though. If it was Oct-thought book club,

549
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,520
 really we would need red wine and also cackling. We've got one out of two.

550
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,440
 So this is also a book that if you read it, you will be reading a work by an Easter Kong guest of

551
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:32,560
 honor because it is The Jasmine Throne by Tasha Sieri. So I always or I always used to try

552
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,560
 to read a book or two by each of the Easter Kong guests of honor and that did sort of

553
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,960
 fall off my priorities list at some point and I'm sort of trying to get back into the habits.

554
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,400
 I think it is a good habit to have. So Liz read it the least recently of the three of us,

555
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,760
 by which I mean that Liz read it on time. She had us as a pick two weeks ago, didn't she?

556
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,440
 No, I specifically did not have it as my pick because I was going to have it as my pick and

557
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,280
 then you all said, "Oh but we're going to read this. You can't have it as a pick." So I had another

558
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,960
 thing as my pick which you briefly complained about because you were also going to read that

559
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,480
 but then we decided getting us organized enough to read one book all at the same time is really

560
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:21,680
 as far as we can go. So yes. It's fair. So I quite liked it. Do you want to tell us a bit about the

561
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:29,920
 book John? So the Jasmine Throne by Touch the Siri is a book about a country which is a colony

562
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:38,000
 of another larger country and it's about two or three characters in that country and their

563
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,960
 interactions with its colonial relationship with its parent country. At the start of the book,

564
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:52,880
 a princess is imprisoned atop a hill but in a more interesting way than it that made it sound

565
00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:01,120
 and we follow her and we follow someone who is from the country in question and we follow a

566
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:07,520
 couple of other characters who are kind of either related to the princess or to the second character

567
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:17,920
 and kind of explore the tensions in that country and explore what it is to be in power

568
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,560
 and also what it is to meaningfully reject power and kind of the difference between

569
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:32,000
 violent revolution with no goal versus quiet sedition with an actual end game in mind.

570
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,720
 And I really liked it. I thought it was good. I thought it was very interesting the way that the

571
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,000
 book handles many of its themes. I very much liked the two central characters. I really liked the

572
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:57,520
 world and it made me very angry in a good way about colonialism and about how countries come to

573
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:04,000
 subjugate other countries. That I think is my kind of, that's the things I took away from it.

574
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,360
 What did you take away from it Liz? Yeah I would agree. I mean what I think is it's a really

575
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:15,680
 impressive and interesting world into which you put some fascinating characters. I do really like

576
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:22,000
 the idea. I think you get a lot of fantasy series where you've got sort of an alliance of city

577
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,840
 states or an emperor who has conquered another country and so to really focus this on the kind

578
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:34,160
 of conquered country and about the kind of colonization of that country. And it's very soon after it has

579
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:41,360
 been colonized as well so kind of it's a really recent wound for everyone, everyone who lives

580
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,600
 who lives there. I thought was interesting and there were some parts I really liked about it because

581
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:53,120
 you get you know these three temple children who were brought up together in Iherania the

582
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,360
 colonized country and they really between them show kind of three different ways in which

583
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:06,240
 you know you can try for revolution and for regaining your country and I think it kind of does a

584
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,680
 great job of discussing kind of the different aspects of how they go about this and kind of

585
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,440
 what their vision is for the future of their country. And yeah there's a great thing where they

586
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,120
 say that the, you know, the project, the conquering country, they say it has reshaped us, it is not

587
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:29,120
 a conversation but a rewriting. So I really loved about how it you know rewrites their history from

588
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:36,320
 the you know perspective of the oppressors. And yeah it is the first of a trilogy so you know it does

589
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:42,640
 kind of you know end a little bit abruptly to give you a hook for the next book but I probably will,

590
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:48,000
 I definitely will pick up the next book and read it and hopefully the third one as well. I'll let

591
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,600
 Alison get a word in anyways. Yeah I quite liked it. I am looking forward to the author saying a bit

592
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,800
 more about it. I probably didn't like it quite as much as either of you two did. As Liz says it's

593
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,560
 the first book of the trilogy and I feel like if they had cut out two or three hundred pages of

594
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,160
 wafting around in the middle of it it could just have been a standalone book in which you put all

595
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,680
 the rest of the plot in as well. I understand that I am not the target market for fat fantasy novels,

596
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:27,120
 this is a fat fantasy novel. Every paragraph is quite nice though it's very lush to read,

597
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,640
 it's very well written, the characterisation is good, all of the major female characters were

598
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:40,720
 interesting and quite complicated and I quite like that. It has a really badly drawn one note

599
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,520
 villain which is not good and is given this absolutely no explanation for why this person is the way

600
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,720
 they are and it just kind of sits there like a kind of clocked in the middle of the story. I

601
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,120
 think it might be intended as a metaphor for Empire but it's not a very good one. A lot of the

602
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:06,400
 other stuff about Empire and colonialism is pretty good. It uses Indian culture as the basis for

603
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:16,080
 its world building and that is very much underused as a way to build fantasy which is good. It then

604
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,800
 does it in a way that I felt still felt like it was hitting the beets of a western fantasy novel

605
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,240
 though I didn't feel oh yes I'm reading something that is about an alien culture as much as I

606
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,840
 would have liked to. That's alien in the sense of alien to me and I thought that was a little bit

607
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,320
 of a shame that she maybe missed a trick there and the other trick I think she really missed is

608
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:46,720
 right at the beginning she kind of introduces the rot as this disease of of breading plantification

609
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,960
 that kills people and she doesn't really she spends most of the novel not going anywhere with it

610
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,680
 and this is a 520 page close typed novel there's a lot of words here something like 160 000

611
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,040
 and you kind of get at the end of the book oh wait that's one of the plot points I'm saving back

612
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,080
 for next time and I was like well that was that that doesn't leave me feeling very good about this

613
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:18,000
 book I would I feel like the the notion that oh I can make more money if I write if I write my

614
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,560
 stories longer I really struggle with you know I don't I just I think that's honestly I think it's

615
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:32,800
 utterb I know we have this argument all the time but I don't think it's fair to say that the only

616
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,280
 reason to write a trilogy is because you want to make money right okay so this is the thing that

617
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,760
 really interested me the thing that really interested me about the novel was the way in which the

618
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,480
 colonialism or the colonization of the country is directly linked to the idea that the magic

619
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:59,440
 consists of the country asserting it of the earth and the water and the fabric of the country as

620
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:06,880
 well as the people reasserting its nature and rising up to fight back against colonization and

621
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:14,720
 I feel that the that this was introduced and then artificially left to one side so that the

622
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:22,000
 story about the people could be expanded for the entire novel but the story tells like the story

623
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,480
 is about the initial stages of that rise up right I'm not sure I think you could have I'm not sure

624
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,880
 you could have taken two thirds of this novel out and had it land the emotional punches it lands

625
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,400
 in the places it lands them and maybe I'm wrong but I mean at least I think you'd need to do it as a

626
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:48,080
 duology okay because I just don't think I just don't see how there's enough space like I thought

627
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,600
 there was some bits in the middle where I thought oh you might be able to cut a little bit of this

628
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,880
 out but I'm talking like you could have made it 140 instead of 160 000 words I'm not saying you

629
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,600
 could have made it 50 000 I don't think this could have been a novella oh no no but you would have

630
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:07,040
 had to have been a novella for the subsequent two installments to fit in a single novel yeah I mean

631
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:15,280
 you know I may be overstating this I did think that I did think it told its story in a in a very

632
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:22,480
 gradually paced way and I think that's fine and I think that's fine for people I mean you know

633
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,560
 I'm probably being a bit mean here I did quite like it I think people who are looking for

634
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:34,400
 worlds in which they could kind of fall into and spend a long time will find a lot to like yeah I

635
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,000
 think it feels deliberate that the kind of pacing of the stories of the characters and how you know

636
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,040
 the the reveal of what is going on with kind of the land of the earth and the waters you know they

637
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:51,040
 are going together so I think you could only speed up kind of the telling of the story as a whole

638
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,320
 rather maybe refocus on one but the other I mean I would also say yeah it's a little bit long I

639
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,040
 think you could probably have it be a hundred pages shorter possibly not by having fewer things

640
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:07,040
 happen but maybe just by you know there's a lot of kind of paragraphs which have a lot of space

641
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,400
 to breathe and you could probably tighten those up a bit and also I think like near the start of

642
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,640
 the book you have Princess Malini who comes to be imprisoned and meets the maid servant who is

643
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,160
 also part of this revolution and it kind of takes quite a long time to get them kind of into the

644
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,280
 same space which is really one of the driving catalysts of the book because what you know the

645
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,880
 relationship between them which turns into a romance is one of the kind of the main I think

646
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,120
 things driving the book because you know the agreements they make with one another and you know

647
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,200
 how they're going to help each other and get their mutual goals like I think you could put them

648
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,600
 together a bit faster and it would maybe you know Malini feels like she has no agency for kind of

649
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,880
 quite a big chunk of the first part of it so you get things moving a bit faster there is how I felt

650
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,680
 and then near the end of the book there seems to be quite a lot of basically wandering around in the

651
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:06,960
 forest I found the last two-thirds of the book very well paced for me I thought it really went

652
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,080
 along and I really enjoyed that I found the first third a little bit slow and I think that is because

653
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,960
 of what Liz just said I think if you had had Malini in pre-air I think it's a classic thing of the

654
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,680
 first maybe 50 pages are set up for the book but we could have had that set up implied I don't

655
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,080
 think you necessarily need to start right at the start of where all the pieces start moving

656
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,600
 you can start at the point where the pieces have got to the point where the story is starting

657
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,480
 and so and so there are a few bits right at the beginning where I think oh you could probably

658
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,800
 make that a lot quicker and especially there's one character in the book that about a third of

659
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,360
 the way through I said to Alison and is like oh I'm not really sure what rail was doing in this book

660
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,600
 and they said aha you will find out what he is doing in this book in the next two-thirds of the

661
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,960
 book and they were right but I think you probably could have spent less time with him I think

662
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:02,160
 those bits in the first third drag I'm also curious I quite liked the baddie but I don't know

663
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,280
 because I liked how personal I liked how personal her relationship with him was but also how

664
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:16,400
 completely her brother couldn't see why I liked that dynamic of he had never I like the other

665
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,480
 brother a lot the other brothers are really interesting character the other brother is a

666
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:27,840
 character that you actually meet all of the time in real life and I like that you know I like to

667
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:35,680
 think that people in books exemplify the kind of complicated characters that humans that I know are

668
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,440
 and they often don't and for the most of the people they do they're just complicated people

669
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,240
 living their complicated lives and doing what they think is best and I like that novels should

670
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,120
 have that fantasy doffles often don't have as much of that as they need so that was good yeah they

671
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,400
 feel like it feels like none of them fit into particularly kind of stereotypical fancy

672
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,200
 archetypes they'll have you know some other things of interest about them and I like the kind of

673
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:08,160
 contrast of the you know familial relationships between Princess Malini and her two brothers and

674
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,280
 between Priya and the other temple children essentially have the same familial relationship

675
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,360
 and upbringing but in a very you know in the very different environment of um

676
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:26,480
 herania I was really interested in the relationship between Bumika and Vikram I really liked the way

677
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,400
 that's depicted and the way that you find out more about Mika through the book and it becomes clear

678
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,400
 that certain things are true but also the way that Vikram is much more complicated than he could

679
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,000
 have been I think he's not super deep but like I found it interesting enough to kind of get my

680
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 teeth into and I take I take the point the chandere is quite he is he is a bad man bad quite like

681
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,360
 that and I wonder whether that'll get expanded on in book two because in this book he's kind of the

682
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:03,680
 he's kind of the boundary condition he's not really the main character he's a thing that everyone

683
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:10,320
 else is reacting to and I and I think as we encounter him more as a character it might be that he has

684
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,200
 some depth or might just be that he's a bad bad man in which case I'll probably also enjoy that

685
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,800
 I think I will probably nominate it for a Hugo award unless I read suddenly a lot of extremely

686
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,360
 good books in the next four weeks which what was the one you said you were going to nominate Liz?

687
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:31,600
 The Unraveling by Benjamin Rosenbaum. So that is after I'm just about to read a

688
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,360
 desolation called Peace which I strongly suspect I will nominate because I love

689
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:42,000
 D'Merecle Empire the Unraveling is the next on my list after that. Yeah next up for me is

690
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,920
 Far From the Light of Heaven by Tardotomson which is you know which is right about to get started

691
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,400
 now and then the next one after that for me is the Catherine Addison Witness for the Dead.

692
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,360
 Oh yes the follow-up or not quite a follow-up but same world as the Goblin Emperor which I did

693
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:06,960
 really love. And that was the Octa Thor podcast and it's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me.

694
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:15,280
 And it's goodbye from me.

695
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:32,160
 You've not even got your video on this.

696
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,360
 Alright let's I will turn my video on briefly and wave.

697
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:43,840
 It's so pretty you've got like crazy geometric like Moorish almost thing behind you.

698
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:51,360
 Yes there's like a sort of mosaic thing on the wall. No nice I like it.

699
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:56,720
 Is your are you holiday? I don't know why I asked Liz if she's holidaying so well.

700
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:04,000
 Oh look at the bath. The bath's like a buddy. Listeners you can't see it but the bath is like an

701
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,520
 altar to baths. Like imagine that there was a church of baths and then imagine what the altar

702
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:16,640
 would look like and that is what Liz baths look like.

703
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,080
 Because basically if you've got a bathtub like this and I don't live in a house with a bathtub

704
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,600
 I'm going to take as many baths as possible. That makes a lot of sense.

705
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,440
 Yeah I think we may have gone even further off topic and John should cut this down to just a

706
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:35,040
 minute and a half. The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin McLeod
