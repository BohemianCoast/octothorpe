00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Let's just go through them. Let's just go through them. Let's just go through them, but skip found artists because they're doing you both staring at me.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Yeah, don't fair enough. I'm 100% Switzerland on the artist.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 93rd episode of Octo the Wop, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 28th of September in 2023.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I am John Coxon.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hi, I'm Alison Scott.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And I am Liz Batty.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And finally, finally, we have the response we've all been waiting for listeners.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 "The match will be occurring. Abigail Nussbaum says..."

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Apologies for not responding in a more timely fashion to your proposed cage match between myself and Chris Garcia.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Now I know that being O'Koron on the podcast is essential for matters of honor, I will be sure never to make such a mistake again.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 As for Chris's challenge, I naturally accept and expect the organizing committee or ever come we both happen to find ourselves at next to spring's action in arranging cage, referee, medical assistance, etc. Best Abigail.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Hoorah! It shall occur.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Let's get this happening people.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 "Strongly suspect the next convention with both Abigail and Chris is Glasgow in 2024. That's the gauntlet for you, Esther."

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Do we know anyone on the programme team for Glasgow?

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 So, if this does occur, I would like to be the like Ringmaster.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Is that what it's called in cage fighting?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I want to be the person yelling in the blue corner with several phransines.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 You don't want to be the Ringmaster, do you? Because the Ringmaster is like the referee and you're what to be the announcer.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Oh, I don't want to be... Well, I could be the referee as long as both of them are not to country.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I would like to get the number of trists, so you could be the referee, John. I'll be the announcer.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Listeners, write in with suggestions for a neutral referee to referee this Abigail Chris cage match.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 You can volunteer yourself if you like.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Please come up with the person in fandom who is exactly the average of Chris Garcia and Abigail Nussbaum.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I'm not sure they even have referees in cage fighting. I have to say, I don't know very much about cage fighting,

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 but I thought part of the point was that there are lots of rules and they just kind of shove them in the cage and let them get on with it.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Well, you were the one who brought up refereeing. I just want to do the shouting. And I stand by it.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Chris says that he's going to buy me a photographer's vest, Ruby sunglasses and cigarette holder, and from this point forward, I shall be set on the S-Coxon, which...

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Mmm. It's very kind of you, Chris. Liz, do you want a... I'm going to have a photographer's vest. I'm looking to get rid of. Do you want one of those?

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 No, I mean, maybe Allison needs it to take all our golf stuff on flights with low-looking limits.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Hehehehehe.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 The really funny thing about this is that Liz wasn't in the chat I did yesterday about the 7 kilogram carry-on limit that I technically have on my trip to Australia

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 and the fact that my carry-on bag cannot possibly weigh less than 7 kilograms.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 It does seem quite harsh.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 You know, people pack for a week in a carry-on bag with a 7 kilogram weight limit, and I can't pack for 24 hours on a plane.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Well, that's just how that goes, right?

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 I mean, fundamentally, the problem is that I do not want to put my laptop into check baggage and I do want to take my iPad on the flight with me in between them.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 No, that is, I mean, that is, both of those are entirely fair. I would not want my laptop.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 In fact, I'm not sure if you're allowed to have your laptop in check baggage because it's got battery in it, but yeah, foreshadowing.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And then he also notes he's never heard "Espanar Sheriff, future host of the Anger Locust podcast origin story."

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 So he enjoyed that.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 We've got a lot of people saying it was nice serious, "Espanar on the pod." I'm glad everyone liked it.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 We'll have to put Stephen on the pod sometime.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Yes, he also notes the Hugo packet is now complete, and this is true, so "Ersatz Culture" noted in 5/7.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I mean, I think I'll try and dig out the link.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 But the fanzine and fan writer categories have now gone live after they were made live unofficially, so it feels like that might have been the impetus that the world come needed to get their act together.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 But yes, so Chris also reports that Hugo packet is now complete.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And then we got a toot of comment from "Ersatz Culture" who told us we've been name-checked on Chinese social media by Arthur Liu.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And this was very good because I opened the page and obviously most of the posts that Arthur did was in Chinese, but the two phrases that leapt out at me was the word "oxo thought" and the phrase "chengdu" is a shower.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And so we have become a term of art in Chinese fandom, which is very pleasing. And we will discuss why now.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 The thing about the explanation that "chengdu" is a shower is that Arthur says, um, by which they mean that "chengdu" is a showy peacock who claims all sorts of wonders for the world come but doesn't deliver.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And that's not quite what the etymology is, but there we go.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I think it's because he's reading it as "chengdu" is a "shower".

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Like a show-off?

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 It basically gets to what it is we're talking about, I think, just from a different route.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Who wants to talk about what happened?

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 I listened to do ask Arthur what he meant, or are you just doing it from Google Translate?

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 That's from a machine translation.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Errrr!

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 But I think so, "Ersatz Culture" in the two did, um, did note that they had emailed Arthur to say that "chengdu" is a shower recur, refers to a shower of "encompetive" and that's not a shower.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 But it's just a shower of incompetence rather than someone that shows off.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I think that was a slight misconception.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 But only very slightly because I think the fact that "chengdu" doesn't have a lot of substance behind quite a lot of things that it's doing, and that is quite worrying at this stage, which is, you know, we're only kind of a month, four weeks out from the convention now, um, is kind of worrying.

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 We don't have much time to, we're gonna have to move into "chengdu" was a shower, and that "chengdu" is a roaring success.

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I hope they're not, because we'd have to redraw the art.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 What the discussion has been referring to is that it looks like "chengdu" have stopped selling, attending memberships. Sorry, attending tickets.

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And it is quite close to the con, so you'd expect them to have some kind of cut-off date, but it sounds like there were people who had applied for fan tables, and they didn't know kind of how many people they'd need, and so they were holding off actually, like, getting tickets.

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And now they may not be able to get tickets, or they may be able to get tickets, but they'll have to buy date tickets instead, which could be a bit more hassle.

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But it seems like they have kind of unexpectedly stopped ticket sales without warning anyone, and you could understand if they may have, you know, stopped ticket sales in advance of the con, but you should probably let people know when you're gonna do that.

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Yes, and it seems to have made a lot of people in Chinese fandom quite annoyed. So this isn't us.

71
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 This isn't us wondering whether or not we're applying our view of how it should work to a convention which is from a different culture.

72
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 This is people in that culture being annoyed by a thing the conventioners doesn't, uh, done and us reporting it, which I think is a, I think is a good distinction to draw.

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Well, and also this didn't really annoy people in the West so much because nearly everyone who had any plans to go at all got their membership by voting last year or has made plans in advance, because obviously you'll have had to apply for your visa by now if you're going and things like that.

74
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So, and there's not that many Western fans going, there are some. I hope you all have a lovely, lovely time. But it was just, I found it very nice that I went on a page of Chinese words and I saw Chengdu as a shower and I was like, ah, I've had an impact.

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Anything else on Chengdu? There's a nice video of the building, which again I got from a South culture, are Chengdu chorus, Bondon? Yeah, and it looks a lot more finished than I could have done.

76
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Given some of the shots we saw in kind of June, July, doesn't look finished, but it looks on the way. It's quite nice.

77
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Reminds me a bit of the new mall and train station they built near the World Trade Centre with big, swoopy ceilings.

78
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Moving from one worldcon to another, I did a panel for Glasgow in 2024 and it was called "Glasco 2024 presents the media of storytelling, print versus screen".

79
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And I was there with AM Justice and RWW Green and Dan Hanks, and it went quite well I think. It was interesting chat.

80
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And I will put a link in the show notes if you would like to watch me moderating a panel or you would like to watch any of those three people being on a panel.

81
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Hoorah. I want to go into a brief non-sequitur here, which is that I've also done "Pints of Science" quite a lot, which is where people go to a pub and they hear from scientists in the pub about their research specialties and you talk for about, I don't know, 15 minutes on your research.

82
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Maybe, maybe a bit long. And then people can ask questions and it's good. But one of the things that has become very obvious over the course of Pina of Science is that the people you're talking to is people that already like science.

83
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And so although it's very good for them, it doesn't really help like get the word out about science, particularly because you're talking to people who already have what is called in public engagement circles.

84
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Science capital, that is people who are already invested in and know a lot about science. And I do have to wonder whether or not the Glasgow 2024 presents stream is not also talking to people who have what I would say is Worldcon Capital.

85
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Or perhaps just Convention Capital. But I do wonder how far out of our bubble they break.

86
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Well, what do we reckon? Well, I think these started as, and Glasgow was bidding during the pandemic and so they couldn't do bid parties. So they were looking for something that they could do that was not bid parties and they concluded that online events like panels and talks and

87
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 discussions and all sorts of things like that were a great alternative to bid parties for a convention that wasn't bidding. And the thing about bid parties that they are also preaching to people who are already familiar with Worldcon.

88
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And I feel like this process has carried on from there, but it's also performing a function to maybe get less well known authors names out there and also to give people practice and things like being on a panel and panel moderation.

89
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And Glasgow is doing quite a lot of good outreach in the Glasgow area. There are a lot of people actively involved in the convention who are not names that are familiar to me from UK fandom or World fandom more generally, but have got involved in fandom through Glasgow.

90
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 That's their entry point in to fandom. And I think that's pretty good. So I think that they're doing outreach in that way. I'm not sure that this particular thing is very outreachy.

91
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 But the thing about panels on the internet is that they kind of stay there forever. So one of these nearworthers that they, they're getting along now later becomes incredibly famous.

92
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 People will go off and find that stuff. So one of the things that I think we probably talked about this because we decided we're going to do it.

93
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 This year's EasterCon conversation recorded almost its entire program and we've had a sort of think about what we should do about that.

94
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And the answer is that we are going to place it with two libraries is the attention, one of which is the South friction Foundation and one of which is phallac.org, not to be like put up on the internet, but to be available for academic research and things of that kind.

95
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Yeah, no, that's a good point. That's a very good point. It is definitely true. I don't have a feel because I'm not like this is only the when London in 20 when black when London 2014 started rolling, which must have been like what 2009 ish.

96
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I think I was still relatively new in fandom. So it is not clear to me how much of an impact London had because I didn't really have like a framework for how to compare it to.

97
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Whereas it definitely seems like Glasgow is getting a lot of people into the community, which I think is like really great.

98
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 So yeah, that is a good point. And the point about them sticking around forever is also a very good point because it does, I think, it does give you like a loie-bree of things Glasgow has done that makes it clear that Glasgow is doing things, which I think is a good point.

99
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 I think it's like a good feeling to have about a world con and might be the diametric opposite of Chengdu in some ways.

100
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I mean, all Chengdu are doing is building an entire new facility. Does that even count? But yeah, I'm not suggesting Glasgow build an entire new facility.

101
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 That'd be crazy. Chengdu does always give this feeling of being something that is not really of fandom in the way that science fiction conventions normally are.

102
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 So building a giant, a child facility and putting your tickets on ticket roster and things like that are kind of an examples of that.

103
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 That it's going to a slightly different crowd. But that's okay. That's that reach of a different sort.

104
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I mean, I think we are clearly Chengdu has led to more interaction between Western SF fans and Chinese ones in all sorts of different places.

105
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And that is absolutely great and probably worth all of the pay just for that really in the long run.

106
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 But then I'm not somebody who's trying to organise the trip of a lifetime to China at the moment.

107
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 To link it all together in a neat bow, that is something I've noticed like a lot of people coming into Glasgow are glass region people.

108
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 So it's quite nice that Glasgow is doing that for Glasgow as well. Everything's great.

109
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 It was a good, I did enjoy the panel. So that was also nice.

110
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And my liaison, Pam Livingston, was an absolute star and she looked after me very, very well. So thank you very much, Pam. You were amazing.

111
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I don't know, Pam listens, but if she does, she was amazing. And if she doesn't, she was still amazing.

112
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Just one more loose thread for this. If people want to go to Pints of Science, which sounds like a fantastic thing, can you put something?

113
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Because I think quite a lot of the people who admittedly have science capital but might like that sort of thing are science fiction fans.

114
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Yes, yes, that is fair. I'll put link in the show notes. They tend to be in May.

115
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 So I've brought this up at almost the worst possible time being as how it is four months since May and eight months till next May.

116
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It's fine. Our listeners are literally organised people and have calendars and consent reminders and we'll definitely not forget about this.

117
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 [Music]

118
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 So we should probably start by saying we're not going to talk about novel because we're going to do an entire episode on novel after the voting deadline.

119
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 What's your best pick in the Vella? Go.

120
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Oh, we're doing it backwards. I've only read one of them so far.

121
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Which one? Into the Riverlands. Any good?

122
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Really disappointing actually. Boo.

123
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Because the first one in the In The Only Vos series I really liked and picked as a pick and this one just doesn't add anything new.

124
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 I've read the first two and they're great but I haven't read the third one yet.

125
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Alison, what are your novela reading?

126
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 My novelas are on my cobalt, all six of them ready for my 24 hour play journey. Gotta read them all on the plane.

127
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Yeah, no, I also have not read. I've got a bit honest. My Hugo reading this year has been... I have not slacked but like, I just haven't got as far as I usually do. I'm not sure what.

128
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 So I've read any of the novelas or novelats. Have I either read any novelats?

129
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I have read two of the novelats. I don't particularly want to vote for either of them so I hope one of the other four will get to be better.

130
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I've read all the novelats except the space-time painter because it's not translated and I tried Google Translate and I think I'm missing lots.

131
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Yeah, Google Translate's much better for non-fiction, for like, like, fancying content and report ours which is for fiction. I think it's really, really hard for fiction.

132
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Yeah, no, the best one I think is probably the John Chew which I know John likes. I also write, you know, like, Marie Vibbot. Okay, those are two best ones.

133
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Oh great, okay, so I think the John Chew is fine. I've... Whoa, wrong head.

134
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I have a real problem with science fiction books that don't have science fiction content and...

135
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 It's got a Superman. When was the last time you met Superman, Alison?

136
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 No, no, no, and the Marie Vibbot is a science fiction story that doesn't have science fiction content. The science fiction content is entirely separate from the actual plot and consequences of this thing, which is about... Well, I mean, you know, it's a perfectly good story but it's...

137
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 But it's science fiction background is just window dressing for it.

138
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 I'm gonna be interested to see if you like the SL Huang which is kind of fiction in the form of a fake nonfiction article which links to lots of footnotes about real AI things in order to discuss AI.

139
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And as a story, it's like, it's not a story and it kind of is like, well, I don't want to read a story which is full of footnotes about things I already know about because it just feels like, why am I reading this article telling me about, like, the heart bleed bug?

140
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Whereas the science fiction. So I'm quite baffled by it's on the shortlist.

141
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Well, you've got to remember, I think, novel and short stories both have, like, really long tales, don't they? So I think it can be that there's, like, 50 stories nominated and one or two nominations can take something up.

142
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Yeah, that's true.

143
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I have read, "If you find yourself speaking to God of Dress God with it, informal you, and I did enjoy it muchly, so, you know, I'll be happy to write for it.

144
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I haven't read the others, but I do intend to read the others." On short story, the only one I've read was "Rabbit Test", which I thought the first half was superlative and the second half sort of just sort of peated out to a close.

145
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Having said that, I haven't read the others. So, like, what do you think? I know Liz loved "Rabbit Test" if I recall.

146
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 I do think the first half is very good.

147
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I've read 506 and "Rabbit Test" is the best.

148
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I think "Rabbit Test" is like the gorilla in this category. Everyone thinks it's a shoe in. People think it is an outstanding story of its time.

149
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Oh, it was okay. I'm probably - I'm hard to please. I'm sorry.

150
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Siri, should we say a bit about Siri's? Because I feel a little bit more qualified to version Siri's than I normally have, as I have read books in four of the six things and, yeah, quite like them.

151
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I think I've read the entire four of them and most of a fifth and nothing of a sixth, so it is very unusual for me.

152
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 What's getting your series, "Rabbit Jackson Bennett", because it's a Finnish series, so he's got no chance of being nominated for this again, and I really liked it, as mentioned many, many previous times.

153
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I feel like, you know, Agent Tykofsky is bound to be back again with a different series.

154
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I do feel a bit bad about Rivers of London because it's been nominated before, I think, and, you know, there's a gap before the next possible nomination, but it will be there, and the Naomi Novick is also in "Load Style".

155
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I also - I probably think the founders' trilogy is the best one of those, but it's very tight.

156
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 So I quite like the Lock Tomb, even though it's not finished. We could always wait until it's finished and then vote for it once it's finished.

157
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I don't think you can.

158
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 But next year is our chance to vote for Brits, so I think next year my ballot is going to be absolutely stuffed with British nominations and votes for British finalists because I am a terrible nationalist in this regard.

159
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I don't think you can vote for the Lock Tomb again.

160
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 No, I think Liz is right, because I don't think there'll be enough extra words added.

161
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 So I think this is probably unless she writes a fifth novel, which I think would be a mistake.

162
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Why can't I vote for the Lock Tomb again?

163
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Because you have to have at least 200,000 words added, so unless the next volume is twice the length of the previous volumes, it won't be eligible next year.

164
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 In that case, I'm going to vote for the Lock Tomb, which I like quite a lot, even though, oh god known as a pile of poo, but never mind.

165
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 I will vote for the Children of Time, because it's the best one and you're the wrong edge.

166
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Is that helpful?

167
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Insightsive Criticism!

168
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 It's very good, it's going to be second on mine, so...

169
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I am also halfway through Fandryside by Robert Jackson Bennett at Liz's Request, so my pick is just saying it does seem to be quite good, seems to be the sort of fantasy I like, and I am really loving it.

170
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And also, after reading Hugo novels, reading something where somebody had put a lot of thought into world building was really a great tonic, and I like that.

171
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Because there's a lot of world building in this novel.

172
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 For Shadowing for Next Episode.

173
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Yes.

174
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I will say, so I'm going to say something which sort of foreshadows our novel discussion.

175
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 So put it this way, I think Fandryside and I think Children of Time are way better than anything that's in the novel category this year.

176
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Is that unreasonable?

177
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Like, if I was looking, reader, listener, for the best science fiction that is on the Hugo Ballot this year, I think two of the best science fiction are in series, and I think probably none of the best science fictions are in novel.

178
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 So, that's like a hot take.

179
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Yeah, okay, that's our hot take.

180
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Series, the good thing about the Hugos.

181
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 No!

182
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 *laughs* However, not a great year for novel.

183
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And then, graphic story.

184
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 I've not read any of the graphic stories in this category, but I'm going to pontificate anyway.

185
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I've read previous installments of Once in Future, Monstrus and Saga, and I do not understand.

186
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Like, they're just not very good, and like, ch-pfft.

187
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 This is the category every year that I'm like, I don't understand what the Hugo Electric sees in any of these.

188
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Like, I read quite a lot of comics, but like, these are not my comics.

189
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 So, I feel like, to the point where I'm like, maybe I just- maybe this isn't the category I should pay attention to, because like, clearly I am so out of step with what the Hugo Electric thinks about this art form that is not useful for me to try and chime in.

190
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 What did you guys think? Either of you read any of these?

191
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 I've read one of them.

192
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Was it good?

193
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Which is Once in Future?

194
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I mean, I like it, so yes.

195
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 I think it's a bit of a step up from the first three volumes, because it's where things start to come together a bit.

196
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 I sort of like a planned five volume sequence. It gets less episodic.

197
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 I think like the character relationships, particularly between Duncan and his grandmother are quite well done and quite coming together.

198
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And I like how colourful the art is in a lot of kind of the other world bits with the knights.

199
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 I do think if you haven't read One, Two and Three, you're going to be totally baffled by Volume 4, but could be the same for Selma Monstrus.

200
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I have one comment on the graphic novel's shortlist, which is that I look at something called Dune, the official movie graphic novel.

201
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And it strikes me that the amount of weight this is carrying from previous texts is so great.

202
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And the likelihood that this is just pictures of the scenes from the movie rendered in graphic novel form seemed very great to me.

203
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And it seems unlikely that it's going to be a shining example of the genre.

204
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And if I'm wrong about that, I'm very sorry guys.

205
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Right, best related work.

206
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Terry Pratchett One's going to win. Haven't read any of them.

207
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Any further comments on this?

208
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I will read the Terry Pratchett One because I am very interested to read it.

209
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And Blood, Sweating, Chrome. I feel like if any of the others are going to win.

210
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Why is it pending? I don't know.

211
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 So I guess I'm discussing all of this as if the main voting block is going to be Western.

212
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 But obviously if the main voting block is Chinese, there is a quite significant chance that Chinese science fiction and oral history Volume 1 might take the prize.

213
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Is that book in English?

214
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 I don't think it is, but I might be wrong.

215
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Because I'm quite interested in Chinese science fiction and oral history. That would be really interesting to read, wouldn't it?

216
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And also I note that it's published by Chengdu Chimes Press.

217
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 So it might have a home-field advantage even beyond just being Chinese.

218
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 But what I don't know, looking at the nominations, what I can't tell is whether or not the number of Chinese nominators was higher than the number of Western nominators, but they nominated more widely.

219
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Or whether it's lower.

220
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Because I think you could explain the nominations either way.

221
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And so I'll be fascinated to see how much of an effect it has at the voting.

222
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 But yes.

223
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 I don't suppose it will win, but I want to have a little nod for Buffalo Leto World Outreach Project.

224
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Because I think the actual model there, where you take something and you try to put it into as many human languages as you possibly can.

225
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 It's really quite interesting.

226
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I don't know how many languages it's in a lot.

227
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Many.

228
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 It's a nice project.

229
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Should I give it a hugo for having a lot of translations?

230
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I don't know.

231
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I mean I also argue that is noticeable for its, you know, primarily for its fictional texts.

232
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And so you have to be awarding them aspects of it, which are not the fictional text.

233
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And so for the Buffalo Leto Project, all I can, you know, vote for is, you know, well done, you go, it translated.

234
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I cannot tell if any of the translations are high quality translations.

235
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Are they well done?

236
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Did they add something?

237
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Can just say, well done, it's been translated.

238
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Yeah.

239
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 That is fair.

240
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I feel, that's the problem, right?

241
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 I feel spectacularly unqualified to make a judgement as to how notable it is.

242
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 In some ways.

243
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I keep thinking about, there are a lot of countries in which there's essentially no science fiction.

244
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 I'm not sure whether this is necessarily the best thing to get translated into those languages, but anything that we can do to get SF to people who literally aren't reading any of it because there is none is a good thing in principle.

245
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Yes, I think, I think I agree with that.

246
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Best dramatic presentation, I would argue that this is another category that has some of the best science fiction on this ballot in it.

247
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And I think those two things are severance and everything everywhere all at once.

248
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And those will be at the top of my ballot, very, very closely followed by turning red and distantly trailed by Black Panther II and Avatar II.

249
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 What do you think?

250
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I absolutely agree with that, except go on, severance or everything everywhere all at once.

251
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 We discussed this already, I'm very definitely on the severance train, and I think you are on the everything everywhere train.

252
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Dithering a bit, yeah.

253
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 It'll be those two, haven't decided yet.

254
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Right.

255
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 I would rather, I think I would rather severance win it because everything everywhere got an Oscar.

256
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 So I kind of think it's already doing well enough, whereas I'd quite like severance to get more recognition.

257
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And I know that's a daft way of framing it, but that's just how it is in my head.

258
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Shout out to Cora Bula here, who said that she hadn't watched severance because she doesn't really like office dramas.

259
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And Cora, I'm sorry for telling tales out of school, but that is one of the biggest laughs I've had this year, so, you know, it got on the pot.

260
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Liz, where are you on that?

261
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 I'm probably with John in that I don't know if everything everywhere all at once needs more awards, and it is really good, but I like severance a lot as well.

262
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I haven't got round to watching Nope, which is the one I hope to get to before the deadline.

263
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I think Nope is very, very good, but it is not as, it is worse.

264
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Jordan Pills films have been going down in quality, which is to say he's been going from like a five out of five to a 4.75 out of five to a four and a half out of five.

265
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 So that he's still maintaining an astonishingly high quality, but I will say like if you've seen Get Out, if you'd put Get Out below severance, you can safely put Nope below severance.

266
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 And if you've seen, if you haven't seen Get Out, watch Get Out instead of watching Nope Get Out is amazing.

267
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 That is the Coxon view.

268
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Yeah, I think it's a tough year.

269
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Like I can see you in which Nope might be the front runner.

270
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Yeah, I mean, I was annoyed. I can't remember what Get Out lost to when it was on the ballot, but I, um, I thought Get Out deserved a Hugo like unequivocally.

271
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 I just thought it was an absolute masterpiece.

272
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 So, um, and I do think that's why I said like, I think this is one of the categories where the quality in this category is top notch.

273
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And the other one where the quality is super high, I think, is best dramatic presentation short form in which I will be voting for Andor and Andor.

274
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Mmm.

275
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Which way round am I putting the Andors? It's the question I find myself.

276
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 I feel very embarrassed about this because I have not yet watched for all mankind and I think it's probably very good indeed because it's got a relatively small audience and nevertheless it's getting, it's finding its way onto the ballot.

277
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 But yeah, one way out for me, Rick's Road is definitely below one way out, which is I think, oh, I just thought it was fantastic.

278
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 That's fair. Liz, what do you reckon?

279
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 I'm just looking at what Get Out lost to.

280
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Wonder Woman.

281
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 It lost to what?

282
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Wonder Woman.

283
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Yeah, no, fuck that. Like, I was outraged at the time and I was still outraged.

284
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Get Out is in every way a better movie than Wonder Woman and everyone who voted for Wonder Woman should be ashamed of themselves.

285
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Mike dropped from the job.

286
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Done.

287
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So one way out is the Andor episode where they have the chanting one way out and Rick's Road is the end episode.

288
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 They are both fantastic.

289
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 I genuinely, it might come down to just how I'm feeling on the day.

290
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And then I think probably, I think, I've not seen Stranger Things for, and I don't think I've gotten up to Stranger in a Strange Land for a Mankind.

291
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 So I'll probably put Balanzashi's next.

292
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 But I'd be astounded if Andor doesn't win it.

293
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 This is another one where if Andor doesn't win it, I will be ashamed of the Hugo Electric.

294
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 It'll be another Get Out here for me.

295
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I've seen them all and Andor is the best.

296
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 You say for all mankind must be great, but it's pretty good, but with some really annoying things in it.

297
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 But it does appeal absolutely directly to, you know, space program nerds.

298
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 So that's it.

299
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Okay.

300
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 So that's why it's going to go the Hugo Ballad is that space program nerds really like it.

301
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And there's a lot of those.

302
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 It's pretty good.

303
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And it has some great episodes, although I don't think they're not one nominated this year.

304
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It's as good as one last year.

305
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 But once it's got momentum, it's going to be on there.

306
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I think it's third or fourth best on that list.

307
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I think for mankind is not as good at the expanse.

308
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 I don't know how common that opinion is.

309
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Well, we are very bogged down in the expanse.

310
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Yeah, they're different.

311
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 We kind of watch an episode and go, "Oh, we really like that."

312
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And then we watch the next one and then we go, "Oh, this episode is in fact,

313
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 this episode is entirely political manipulations that are not obviously forwarding the science

314
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 fiction of Bitsons plot."

315
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,240
 If you feel that way about the expanse, I am now extremely curious how you will feel

316
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,760
 about for mankind.

317
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,080
 And I love for mankind.

318
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,560
 One thing I will say about it, which is why I like it less than the expanse, is that

319
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,680
 several of the scenes I have to watch by being in a different room and hearing the TV because

320
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,960
 I can't actually watch them because they are too excruciating.

321
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,960
 And I find it incredibly difficult to actually watch.

322
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,960
 It's a very intense show for me.

323
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
 For all mankind.

324
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
 Yes, for all mankind.

325
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,960
 You have to watch it from another room.

326
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
 Wow, okay.

327
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,960
 The bit where I can't say it, but there are, in every episode there is usually at least

328
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,960
 one sequence where a character does something and I can see how it's going to go and I'm

329
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
 like, "I can't watch this happen."

330
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
 What's it, second-hand embarrassment?

331
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
 I suffer second-hand embarrassment very acutely.

332
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,960
 See, I normally do, but for all mankind it's fine.

333
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
 Yes, fair.

334
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,960
 Best editor categories, no one knows what editors do.

335
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
 Editors are a mystery.

336
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
 None of us are voting.

337
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
 Next categories.

338
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,960
 Any follow-ups on that, guys.

339
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
 No, that's fair.

340
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
 Best professional artist.

341
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,960
 I will confess I haven't looked yet, but it is one of the categories I always vote in

342
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,960
 because it doesn't take long to look at the pictures and be like, "All right, those pictures

343
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
 best."

344
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,960
 Yes, so I'll say the same that's for fan artists.

345
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,960
 What I care about is how well the artist is representing the book and unless I have some

346
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
 familiarity with the book it can be quite hard to tell.

347
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,360
 Semi-pros-ing, I'll be putting uncanny at the bottom because I don't want them to win

348
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
 another Hugo.

349
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,960
 I'll probably be putting a skate pod at the top, not because I have a good example of

350
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,460
 their output because I like a skate pod and I think one day it should probably win a Hugo

351
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,960
 for best-sowing protein because it has been very consistently good.

352
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,960
 So I don't like fiction podcasts.

353
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,960
 I don't listen to fiction podcasts either, but they are actually not just podcasts.

354
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,960
 Being able to tell whether something is notable is not quite the same as liking the thing it

355
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,960
 is notable for doing, if that makes sense.

356
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,960
 I'm not going to start listening to fiction podcasts to find out what's good, right?

357
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
 Listen, it needs to leave you a question.

358
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
 I'm still using a question, but I'm sorry.

359
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,960
 We're going to avoid discussing Francine, FAN-CAST and FAN-ARTIST because obviously various of us

360
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,960
 are nominated in each of those three categories.

361
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,960
 Nonetheless, obviously all of them are chock full of excellent people and we recommend you

362
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,960
 consume all of them thoroughly prior to voting.

363
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
 Yeah, but do vote.

364
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
 Do support the Fancart categories.

365
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,960
 I think we haven't quite managed to get rid of the minimum votes requirement yet.

366
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,960
 I think it gets ratified this year and we'll be gone next year, but meanwhile we still need you to vote guys.

367
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
 Yes, agreed.

368
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,960
 Even if you vote, no award, please vote.

369
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,960
 Arthur Looze obviously getting jobs vote because he mentioned Dr Thought.

370
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:20,960
 No, fan writer, Bita Carella, who is the highlight of my social media feeds every time they publish anything.

371
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
 I love their Elon Musk.

372
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,960
 He is the funniest character in all of fiction.

373
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,960
 Just, oh my goodness, so good, so good.

374
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:38,960
 And I was introduced to her through the Hugo ballot last year because I hadn't come across her before that, but she is great.

375
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,960
 Right, and then load star.

376
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,960
 I have read two and a half of these.

377
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
 Well, I've read one, so go ahead, John.

378
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,960
 Erm, okay, so I read A Catwoman, which I thought was...

379
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,960
 I thought it was good up until the ending where randomly COVID happens and there's a lockdown.

380
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
 And it talks all about that.

381
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,960
 And then the characters continue having their adventure outside anyway.

382
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,960
 And I was like, I don't know what message it is you're trying to send by including this in your book.

383
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
 Bloodmarked, I'm halfway through.

384
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:18,960
 Very conflicted about bloodmarked because on the one hand it is an attempt to take Arthurian legend and explore what it would be like if it had black women in it.

385
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
 But on the other hand it...

386
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
 There's a lot of proper nouns, it's that kind of fantasy.

387
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,960
 And I don't hate it, but I'm not sure it does much that interests me.

388
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,960
 But the kind of racial components are really, really interesting.

389
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,960
 So I was kind of like half, incredibly in my wheelhouse, and half kind of varied by the numbers.

390
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,960
 Erm, and I kind of find it hard to disentangle those.

391
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,960
 And then I read the Golden Enclave's "Why Naiminovic?" which I thought was good.

392
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:51,960
 At the moment I'd probably put bloodmarked at the top, but I'm not sure I've got enough, like, of a view of the category yet.

393
00:35:51,960 --> 00:36:03,960
 So I'm deprioritising this category because I increasingly find that I am now so far away from being a young adult that a lot of young adult fiction really annoys me.

394
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,960
 So I'm not sure I'm actually going to get rad to reading any of these before the Verdict deadline.

395
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,960
 Last year, "Loadstar" had two of my favourite books on the ballot in it.

396
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,960
 Erm, so I do often read "Loadstar" because I do think that sometimes it has some real gold in it.

397
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,960
 I'm just not sure I've come across the real gold yet.

398
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,960
 Obviously there'd be some amazing young adult books.

399
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,960
 I haven't read in "The Serpent's Wake" but I do normally like books by Rachel Hartman.

400
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
 And then "A Stounding"!

401
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:39,960
 I've read "The Travis Baldry" book and I'm sure I've read the "Everena Maxwell" that got them on the ballot last year,

402
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,960
 which I think was the kind of romance novel, which I very much enjoyed.

403
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
 You're kind of interested in looking at colonialism.

404
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,960
 But yes, I'm not sure I've got a very good view of this category, either of you.

405
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,960
 Isabel Kim has put a package of her short stories in the Hugo packet and I've now had a couple of reports from people going,

406
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
 "Oh my god, these are amazing!"

407
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,960
 Ooh!

408
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,960
 Yeah, Isabel Kim's, er, I nominated one of her short fiction pieces from "Stranger Isons",

409
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,960
 which is a much more interesting take on AIR to, I think, than some of the other ones.

410
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,960
 Yeah, and I've read "The Everena Maxwell" as well, the first novel, the, you know,

411
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,960
 "Fake Dating", "Let's Huddle" for warmth in a cabin one, as I think of it.

412
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,960
 Yeah, I think at the moment I vote for Kim first, then maybe Maxwell, but I have to do a bit more research in this category.

413
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
 Okay, I think that's everything.

414
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:41,960
 Alison, you're going on Juff.

415
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
 I am, I'm literally Juff.

416
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,960
 Yeah, because it's like "Jiff" isn't it? It must be pronounced the same.

417
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
 Juff.

418
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,960
 Erm, so it's "Giff" anyway, and I'll die defending it and also "Guff".

419
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
 Chris Garcia is going to write in.

420
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,960
 Chris Garcia, you're always right, Sid, that was a pretty straightforward prediction, wasn't it?

421
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,960
 Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying, you know, I don't bet on things that I'm sure are outcome.

422
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,960
 I mean, if you didn't get a letter from Chris, you'd check your spam buckets, right?

423
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
 I took it still alive.

424
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
 I messaged him to make sure he was okay, yeah.

425
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
 But yes, "Guff".

426
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
 It's all go. Sorry, it's all Joe.

427
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,960
 Yeah, so literally getting on a plane before this episode comes out, by the time this episode comes out, I will be in Australia.

428
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,960
 I'm taking enormous amount of tech with me. I don't know how that happened. It doesn't seem like me at all.

429
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,960
 But I'm taking a number of, I'm taking a 3D camera and I'm taking a 360-degree camera and I'm taking a telephone.

430
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
 Guess which one's good to get the most use?

431
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,960
 There's a camera and I'm taking a microphone so that I can record a couple of issues of Octa thought while I'm in Australia and New Zealand.

432
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,960
 So we better do that, guys. We haven't actually sorted out exactly when we're going to do it, but we will.

433
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,960
 And yeah, there's just whole box full of tech and I carefully packed it up to make sure it all fitted.

434
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,960
 And then I remember that we were recording today, so I had to carefully unpack it and set up to record.

435
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,960
 I didn't know that. That's amazing.

436
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,960
 I have started thinking about, I'm not administering Guff yet, but I've started thinking about how you can support the fanphones

437
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,960
 and one of the ways you can support the fanphones is by getting me to send you a postcard.

438
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:20,960
 And I will send you handwritten postcards from Australia or New Zealand, probably from Australia, for a donation of £5 or more to Guff,

439
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,960
 which you send to guffeurope@gmail.com.

440
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,960
 By PayPal. If you can't do it that way, then get in touch and we'll find another way you can pay.

441
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:38,960
 And they come in four flavours, which are kind of picture postcards of Australian things, which are at the £5 level.

442
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,960
 And the other thing is a £5 level is a photo of me on the Guff trip, but that won't be a handwritten postcard.

443
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,960
 That'll be kind of sent from an internet postcard sending service.

444
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,960
 And at the £10 level, you can have a special and unique, well, not unique because there's going to be a few of them,

445
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,960
 but a special card that's being designed for the Guff trip.

446
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,960
 And the other £10 level is special requests like, "Could you send it from New Zealand?"

447
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,960
 And "Could you have one with Lego on it?" and things of that sort, they cost £10.

448
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:20,960
 And yeah, please support Guff because this trip's going to be amazing and it's also going to cost a fortune, very sorry guys.

449
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,960
 But I will report back, there'll be lots and lots and lots of Guff reports.

450
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,960
 How much would it cost to get a postcard made of yet Lego?

451
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,960
 You could get them on the Lego store and I think they're about to any quid.

452
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
 Oh.

453
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,960
 And there is an Australia, there's a Sydney one, there's an Australia one.

454
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,960
 Could have fun, have lots of fun.

455
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,960
 Yes.

456
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,960
 And I am meeting lots of fans and this is once again, if you're in a place I'm going and we haven't already agreed to meet up,

457
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,960
 then please get in touch and we'll sort that out.

458
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:54,960
 I've reached out to a lot of people at this point, but I'm sure I've missed some people and I'm sure there's people out there that I don't know about.

459
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
 I do want to hang out.

460
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,960
 That was the Auto Podcast and it's goodbye from me.

461
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
 It's goodbye from me.

462
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,960
 It's goodbye from me.

463
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:23,960
 [Music]

464
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:31,960
 When I was young, there were movie tie-in novels and very occasionally one of them was good, but most of them were not good at all.

465
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,960
 But I suppose 90% of everything is crap, so you know.

466
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:49,960
 I did quite like the movie tie-in novel for solo, which was written by Merlaffte because there is a brilliant scene where Chewbacca and Lando discuss hair conditioning advice and that scene was worth reading the novel.

467
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:57,960
 Like, because it just makes perfect sense, Chewbacca's like, "I've got to get all this out of my hair, who is the person to talk to about personal grooming, that guy?"

468
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
 Fucking, no notes, 10 out of 10.

469
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
 And it's definitely not hard, isn't it?

470
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
 So...

471
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
 Exactly right.
