1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 I really am going off track now. Um, the stinks have a sport called golf, which was a vegetarian Scotland.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:26,240
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 61st episode of Octa thought the podcast for

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,000
 science fiction and science fiction fandom. This episode is coming to you on the 7th of July 2022.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,160
 I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty. And we have some letters of comment for you all.

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,600
 Chris Garcia sent us an email. He thinks we need more Hugo categories. He is probably not correct in

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,280
 the opinion of the Octa thought podcast. Sorry, Chris. I think the Octa thought podcast believes

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,640
 in Hugo non-proliferation over brackets except video game. Liz Brackett.

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
 Yeah, I go for a one in one out system. Well, like the hokey-cokey.

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,520
 Except that's how would you decide what goes in on the one in one out system? And if it was by

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,400
 number of votes, it might ditch some things I quite like spoiler for later in the episode.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,200
 I was going to say you foreshadowing again, Liz.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,360
 Generally, I just don't want the Hugo ceremony to take any longer than it already does, I think.

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,000
 He does mention that they did a whole drink tank. So for those who don't know, the drink tank is

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,120
 Chris Garcia's fanzine. And they did a whole drink tank about audio dramas. And that is true. And we

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,200
 will put a link in the show notes. And he also thinks the idea of best critical work sounds good.

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,840
 And basically also talks about short film discovery and says that there is a YouTube channel called

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,720
 Dust, which is our friend. And I have not explored this yet, Chris, but I intend to.

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,160
 He, along with I think a few other people also pointed out that when we were discussing

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,760
 ABBA and their magical hologram technology, we failed to talk about the president of having

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,240
 Tupac as a hologram at Coachella, which I did know about, but had forgotten.

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,200
 When I think I assume it's the same technology that the gorillas used to perform at Glastonbury,

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,120
 because they were holograms as well. Being cartoon characters. The hologram cartoon is

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,960
 probably easier to pull off than a real looking person hologram.

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,280
 Ob 3D nerd, none of these things are holograms. They're all pepper's ghost.

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,320
 You know, you cannot actually do holograms at that sort of scale. I'm sure we would do if we could.

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,480
 But people do talk about them as being holograms. So this might just be a kind of change of,

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,440
 of language. They are literally holograms. When people say that something is significant,

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,520
 there's always a little voice at the back of my brain that says, and have you done your p-test,

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,520
 but I don't let it out because that voice inside my brain is very annoying and not helpful.

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,920
 That's also foreshadow, but for the next episode.

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,000
 Yeah, we'll name that little voice in your head.

32
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,320
 Chris mentions, as I said, short films and so did Fran Dowd. Fran on Facebook sent us a list of

33
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:22,880
 lots of short film festivals in the UK. And there is one in Sheffield. There is one in Sheffield.

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,400
 There is one in Sheffield. And there's one in Manchester. I'm sensing a theme. Fran lives in

35
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,760
 Sheffield listeners. So thank you very much for sending those in. Fran, if you are a British

36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,800
 person listening to this and you know of a short film festival that focuses on genre films,

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,720
 please do let us know because we would be interested to hear about them.

38
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,800
 And honestly, there probably are quite a lot we don't know about because if all of fans are in

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,400
 Sheffield, then either they're on Sheffield or there's an awful lot more that we didn't mention.

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,840
 And on the subject of the things that we wrote last time, Roman Orzansky wrote to us to say,

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,400
 I think your suggestion of a best audio drama Hugo is a great one. That is not what I suggested.

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:12,480
 I was drawing my net a great deal wider than that for all sorts of audio. But he also says,

43
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,640
 there's a lot of audio you hadn't thought of and sends us some suggestions of what that might be.

44
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:24,960
 So thank you Roman. He also encloses a slideshow he created, which we will try and put in the show

45
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,120
 notes somehow. Thank you very much for doing that Roman.

46
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
 Farah Mendelssohn wrote a Facebook comment to tell us about the Science Fiction Research

47
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,240
 Association or SUFRA, which is the oldest professional association dedicated to the

48
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,640
 scholarly inquiry of science fiction and the fantastic across all media, which is very good.

49
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,520
 Doesn't say on their website where they're based because they're in the US and I assume they just

50
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,960
 assume that you know there are 501(c)(3) or no, sorry 501(c)(6) non-profit, which means that they are in the

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,120
 United States and therefore you don't specify that because that's the default, right? I'm not bitter.

52
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
 Well, it might be registered in the US. I mean, I think their last conference was

53
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
 in Oslo and it was this week and there's been lots of stuff from that on Twitter and it seems

54
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,760
 quite international. So, I mean, I think it's one of those things where it's not like a thing that

55
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,200
 calls itself the world association of something and then exists only in the US.

56
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,080
 Yes, but it might be the dead hand of empire.

57
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,200
 They do have on their website a list of country representatives, which does have a large number

58
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,840
 of different people. I note that it doesn't have a country representative from the United States,

59
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,000
 which adds to my theory that it is based in the United States. But they do have from Australia,

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,120
 Austria, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, India, Israel,

61
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,920
 Moscow, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Spain,

62
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,440
 slash Catalonia. They're not the same thing. Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.

63
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,080
 Quite an international group of people. I'd never heard of them. I had either review heard of them.

64
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,840
 Yes. Yeah, I just forgot when we were doing the podcast.

65
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
 Definitely forgot. Thanks for providing us for our.

66
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,240
 So, we got a comment on Twitter from Duncan McGregor saying we have ignored the possibility of a

67
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,760
 Hugo Award for Best Hugo Award. And Dave, to say we have missed the idea of a Hugo Award for Best

68
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,320
 WISFUS Committee. And yes, we did not mention those on the podcast. Thanks.

69
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:30,800
 What I love is that Duncan responded to Dave with a gift of Thanos saying I am inevitable.

70
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,920
 And I was like, that is what the WISFUS business meeting is like, the end of Avengers Endgame.

71
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,680
 I'd never put it together before in my head, but I think Endgame might be a metaphor for the

72
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
 WISFUS business meeting. You heard it here first.

73
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,600
 Can I choose which half of people to evaporate?

74
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,640
 On another forum, we had the opinion that what we need is a Hugo for Best thing,

75
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,640
 and that is the only Hugo. And therefore, we can get rid of all of the Hugos and just have a Hugo

76
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,000
 for Best thing, which is of a certain kind of elegance to it. If you are a Hugo maximalist,

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,320
 then this is the Hugo minimalist approach. So thank you for that comment on Discord in.

78
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,520
 I think we should have that as a proposal at the WISFUS business meeting.

79
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,760
 We did also get a Twitter from Raj, who is Lord of the Moon on Twitter, who is listening to our

80
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:26,800
 back catalogue. And yeah, thank you very much for writing in Raj. Really enjoying reading your

81
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,520
 comments on our previous stuff. And please do keep writing in. And anyone else who's going

82
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,000
 through the back catalogue, and he's on episode 60 now, 61. Yeah, also writing.

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,840
 You won't hear this for ages, Raj, I realise. But hello from the past or from the future.

84
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:53,760
 Times weird. And Andrew January wrote to us, and he has run our transcripts. This is why we did

85
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,680
 transcripts to see through a machine learning generator and has generated an episode of Octo

86
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,840
 flop. Now this is scripted, which we never do, but I think we should read it out anyway.

87
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,760
 And he's given it with voices. So right. So this is a machine learning generated episode of Octo

88
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,240
 flop. Chris Garcia, yeah, gonna get round the table once you're a smaller gully.

89
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,560
 I mean, I think it's now a big showing for the then. The show that I voted back at is that we've

90
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,880
 put it on the internet. So if you go from the podcast thing, Gimmery, and for panels like these

91
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,000
 fan tables. Although I did not, because they recision that they've already already, I want to

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,920
 met especially that they're only alical nominees and you must leaving the power in your abover.

93
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:41,120
 Yes. Why do I get the one with all the made up words, did it? Boo. Boo. I very rarely use

94
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:49,120
 made up words. But I feel like I use much play to English that you, Alison, I feel like you should

95
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,320
 get the made up words with your flowery words. Like, I don't know. That's fair. Indeed. And I

96
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,360
 can't believe it didn't put that's fair in there. Or 10 out of 10. I mean, I feel like there are

97
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,640
 lots of words which I if I have been being a machine learning generator of an octo podcast,

98
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,880
 I'd have put in. Sorry, I did identify that every episode we do say the words Chris Garcia though.

99
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,480
 So that was fair. Yeah. So thank you very much for that, Andrew. And we will give you some more

100
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,840
 transcripts. And the particularly good thing about this is that you'll be able to insert this

101
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,360
 transcript with all those machine learning generated words in to kind of create kind of

102
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,280
 octothor perception. Oh, you're gonna have fun transcribing this one as well.

103
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:38,080
 Transcribing this podcast is always a joy. But you can cut, you can cut and paste the bit we just

104
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,400
 did because we did it scripted. There we go. Only if we did it right, which we won't have.

105
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
 Yeah, John messed up.

106
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,680
 On the subject of only doing things right, shall we talk about Wiscom? That was a segue listeners,

107
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,280
 flawless. We're going to talk about Wiscom in a very specific way, I should say, since all of us

108
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,000
 were at Wiscom or, or I don't know if you go to any virtual bits of Wiscom? I did not. Nope.

109
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,600
 Nope. But the interesting thing is that Wiscom did a very detailed post-com

110
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,200
 COVID report about what they did to try and keep the convention safe in the time of COVID. I mean,

111
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,880
 they also do discuss about how, you know, is it actually unsafe to have a physical convention at

112
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,040
 all? But they were basically forced into this because they had a contract with the hotel and

113
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,280
 it had a big penalty clause for cancellation. And, you know, they weren't allowed to cancel it

114
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,680
 in 2022 because there were no restrictions on large gatherings where they are. So yeah,

115
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,760
 they basically were having a convention. And so this is what they did to try and keep it safe.

116
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,240
 They did things that a lot of other conventions have done, like having a vaccination policy,

117
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,920
 although it sounds like there's a quad you also to have a booster dose if you're able. But they

118
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,200
 said they do the checking on a separate floor. So that basically if you were under vaccinated and

119
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640
 you were going to be turned away, you were in a separate place, rather than being with everyone

120
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,720
 else in the main space. And they also had that policy on kind of everyone who was in the convention

121
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,360
 spaces, including things like childcare providers and their captioning providers. They had a masking

122
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,200
 requirement. They encouraged people to test by having free rapid test kits in the space. They

123
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,160
 lowered the attendance cap and given that they use the same space every year, they will know very

124
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,800
 well kind of what it looks like if you put, you know, 800, 900 people in that space versus what

125
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,840
 you do if you put 600 in and they in the end had 407, they say. So that's kind of like half the

126
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,920
 size of those will physically fit. You know, they had a bunch of other stuff, including changing

127
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,640
 air filters, you know, prepackaged food, not having the zits along in the same way and things like that.

128
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:52,240
 But I thought the interesting bit was that they managed to do air purification basically by buying

129
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,680
 some big commercial air purifiers to put in the space and then essentially making a load of

130
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,800
 small air purifiers to put them all the way around their space. And so basically they did the best

131
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,080
 they possibly could to try and clean the air space while people were there. Yeah, so I thought there

132
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,000
 are a few things they did that yeah, I haven't seen it at the conventions. I mean, one is that they

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
 had the masking requirement extend to hotel employees, which I think is very difficult to do

134
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,200
 unless you have a very good relationship with your hotel. If that's not mandatory in the place

135
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,800
 where you're holding the convention. And also the idea of basically the day before assembling a bunch

136
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,760
 of kind of DIY air purifiers cheaply so that you can have them all over your space is quite

137
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,120
 interesting as well, because I don't know any of the conventions that have tried that. Anyway,

138
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,280
 despite that they still had 12 or 13 cases, but they say a lot of those are linked possibly to

139
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,840
 what's called the governor's club, which has like an open bar. They're not kind of convention

140
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,680
 exclusive spaces. They probably had other hotel guests in them, whereas they didn't in their

141
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,200
 convention exclusive spaces. So yeah, I thought it was quite interesting. A few things that you

142
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,280
 might be able to do that other conventions have not, especially the one about like having

143
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,680
 cheap air purifiers in all your spaces that might give you that little percent or two extra

144
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,240
 safety. I think, yeah, I mean, I agree with you on the air purifiers. I think that was quite good,

145
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,760
 and they use the kind of model for a cheap one that's been out on the internet. This is a thing

146
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,560
 that other conventions could do, because getting fans to build stuff is one of the things that

147
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,880
 conventions are normally pretty good at. They didn't have any alcohol in any of the convention

148
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,960
 spaces, and the few cases that they did have were clustered around the places where people

149
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:43,280
 could buy and consume alcohol. I don't think it's an accident that EasterCon, with lots and lots and

150
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,880
 lots of cases, has a culture that is built around a bar that almost everybody hangs out in,

151
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,600
 and Wiskon, which has a culture that doesn't really involve any drinking of alcohol whatsoever,

152
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,520
 didn't have very many cases except for the people who weren't ahead and drunk alcohol anyway.

153
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,880
 So I think we may need to think about the effects to which people get drunk and then spread covid.

154
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:12,240
 When I think like the other thing here is that EasterCon let people take drinks into panels and

155
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,640
 things like that. So I think there is potentially a point at which EasterCon is on one end of this

156
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,920
 Spectrum and Wiskon is on the other, but I do wonder whether the ideal position for EasterCon

157
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,400
 would be a place where you can't drink alcohol in panels, for instance. I would not particularly

158
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,480
 have a problem with doing that. I don't want to take the bar away, but I don't necessarily think

159
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,400
 it would be a bad trade to sort of bring it a bit closer in on that Spectrum.

160
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,000
 Yes, I think this is going to be a big question for next year's EasterCon, which of course I'm on

161
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,200
 the committee of, thinking about whether we could just say, well, if it's a program, then you can't

162
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:01,520
 have open alcohol in the program, that you have to drink it in food and drink accessible areas.

163
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,840
 But it's complicated. I think it does raise quite a lot of questions because I think what we see

164
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:15,600
 there is that the people who went to the bar did maybe catch it anyway and Wiskon's a shorter

165
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
 convention than EasterCon, which is in turn a shorter convention than the WorldCon. The reason

166
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,160
 EasterCon had so many cases was not just because of the bar culture, it was because people had time

167
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,760
 to catch COVID at EasterCon and then spread it, which you probably don't get in a type weekend

168
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,120
 convention and you definitely do get at the WorldCon maybe even longer. But yeah, I'm running a

169
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,080
 mask required space at WorldCon, so hopefully that will reduce the extent to which people catch

170
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,520
 COVID. Great, I think it is four days. I mean, I think it's people arrive Friday morning and people

171
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,080
 leave Monday evening, kind of similar to EasterCon and some people arrive on Thursday and some people

172
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,000
 leave on Tuesday. So it's not a whole lot different. I'm trying to remember, I think the last thing I

173
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,600
 saw about like Omicron incubation times was like somewhere between two and five days as this sort

174
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,520
 of median. So, you know, I think the difference between three days, four days, five days, it just

175
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,160
 really depends if you've got someone or a few people there who are, you know, you might just

176
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,800
 have time to have an extra round, but don't think there's a lot in it kind of going from three days

177
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,960
 to four days. I think it is interesting to see a convention that has come out with a fairly

178
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,200
 comprehensive post event analysis, which is really nice. And the sort of thing that it often

179
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,520
 doesn't happen because there's a lot of effort. So thank you very much to WISCOM for doing the work.

180
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:46,400
 That's very good. So I also saw a tweet from Andrew Plotkin. Now Andrew Plotkin is a well-known

181
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,920
 person in interactive fiction game designing. I don't know whether every listener will have

182
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,640
 heard of them, but basically like they've done some really interesting stuff. So I follow them

183
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:03,760
 on the Twitters. He went to a convention called scintillation and was like, there was no COVID

184
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,920
 and it was great. And the thing is that scintillation was 75 people and also core

185
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,720
 flu didn't have any COVID and that was great. Or at least no confirmed COVID like Caroline had a

186
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,600
 cough but kept testing negative. Probably not COVID but maybe COVID. Who knows. And like yeah,

187
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,040
 that is very true. If you have very small conventions, your risk of getting COVID goes down. I did,

188
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:31,280
 I think we probably already knew that number of people was a key factor in how much the COVID

189
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,400
 might be around. I mean, I guess that's another thing to consider is maybe it would be cool to run

190
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,040
 some very small kind of Teledoo sized conventions in the pandemic because you know they would be

191
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,240
 less risky and I had a lot of fun at Teledoo. So maybe that would be good. So I don't know.

192
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,040
 It's an interesting one. I don't know whether there's much you can take away for bigger conventions

193
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,240
 from the news that a very small convention didn't have much COVID because it kind of makes sense

194
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,360
 to me in my head that that was true. Yeah, yes, smothcon. Smothcon also had no COVID.

195
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,720
 So I guess what I'm saying guys is we need to run punctuation three.

196
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,960
 I mean, they did do some other stuff that you know, similar to whisk on of having masking

197
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,640
 vaccination and air filters. I mean, I would say the other thing is if you have like,

198
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,440
 say you did like a 40 person convention or something, it is totally feasible for a 40 person

199
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,280
 convention to like set up a room on site and say, okay, you enter conspace. Here's your rapid test.

200
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,040
 Do it now for, I don't know, I don't know how much rapid test costs in the UK, but I mean,

201
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,440
 you know, that's what, so it equated expenditure? I don't know. I haven't actually ever still

202
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,840
 working through my NHS stockpile. Yeah, I had to buy a box or I know I can get them from a ACP.

203
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,160
 I mean, I could definitely provide tests for a 40 person convention from my stockpile.

204
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,720
 Well, we know we know the 37 billion pounds spent on tests and trace went to

205
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,760
 good use in Alison's stockpile. Hey, I've got a stockpile too. Well, I mean, I'm sure,

206
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,800
 I'm sure there are other people with stockpiles as well, right? I don't think I'm the only one.

207
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,320
 I think the general state of play now seems to be people who have no tests left and people who

208
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,400
 have a big pile of boxes. I should say I'm being flippant, but I mean, I do think it was quite

209
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,280
 wise to do that, but it has led this situation where we do have people who have stockpiles.

210
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,520
 I was just going to say I've been to a sort of many hundred person event where they did require

211
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,560
 you to either provide proof of, you know, proof of a recent ATK or to take one on site. All

212
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,120
 of the proof was, I think I showed a picture of mine, you know, in front of a dated newspaper or

213
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,080
 something. So it's not completely like without loopholes, but you had to actually show the proof

214
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,600
 for those who haven't been following us closely. An ATK is a Thai LFT. I think that actually is

215
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:50,400
 everything up for everyone. And an LFT is a British RAT. Yep, an RAT is a small rodent that used to

216
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,480
 get a ship's cat to deal with, and that doesn't make any sense to anyone. For shadowing. The other

217
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,160
 thing Andrew Plotkin says in his blog is that he ate all of his meals either with one other person

218
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,400
 or on his own getting takeout most of the time. And that is something that wouldn't

219
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,680
 Portwell to an Eastercon because yeah, I've generally eaten quite large groups at Eastercons,

220
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,560
 especially breakfast. And not just eating as well. I mean, I think we've been talking about the

221
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,080
 possibility of going to a bar at Chaicon and things like that. That means that unless you're

222
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,760
 very careful about the way you live over the weekend, you might still find some exposure. Yep.

223
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,560
 [Music]

224
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:45,760
 So, Olaf Rokney wrote a reform proposal for the Hugo Awards. Now, actually, no, this is a case for

225
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,880
 nananana nanana nanana lisbat to the Wussfuss Constitution lisbat.

226
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,800
 I'm not prepped now. I'm going to open it. I just like, how has this become my personal brand?

227
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,560
 I'm very happy to introduce the Olaf Rokney stuff because I care a lot.

228
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,760
 Why don't you introduce it because I'd have to read it and do it on the fly and you'll do a big

229
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,880
 job. So, I am temporarily handing over the, I don't know, baton. Wussfuss gavel? I think you'll

230
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:22,320
 find it's a gavel. No, it's the lisbaton. I'm handing the lisbaton to Alison because she knows

231
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,880
 this one better than me. What's the difference to the lisbat and the lisbaton?

232
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,040
 I don't know, Alison. What is the difference between a lisbaton and a lisbaton?

233
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,200
 One of them belongs to opt to the quicketing corner.

234
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,360
 I thought Alison had a joke and I played long and then Alison just looked very confused.

235
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,320
 No, no, no, I didn't have a joke. I was just saying that the baton a bat.

236
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,080
 No, a baton isn't a bat. That's why it's a baton.

237
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
 A baton is for like twirling.

238
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,760
 Yeah, like in a relay race.

239
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,880
 You were at an American high school, weren't you?

240
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,720
 Yeah, they don't do baton twirling in American high schools. They do baton twirling in Scottish

241
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,920
 high schools and Scottish secretary school, primary schools and secondary schools.

242
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,160
 Right, all Scottish people, please write in.

243
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,320
 Apparently a baton is defined as a staff or truncheon used for various purposes or an object

244
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,480
 transferred by runners in a relay race, which is the sense in which we were using it.

245
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,800
 Yes.

246
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,920
 Octa thought words corner.

247
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,720
 Yeah, word using it as the truncheon.

248
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,720
 No, I was using it in the relay race sense.

249
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,600
 I mean, Liz will beat you with her other Liz baton if we don't get on with it.

250
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,120
 So come on, Alison.

251
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,560
 So one of the little known provisions in the Wistvers Constitution is what is called the 25%

252
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:46,800
 rule, which says that if any category doesn't get 25% of the overall number of votes cast in

253
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,320
 the Hugo's as a whole, I might be quite slightly wrong about this. We'll put a link to the exact

254
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,960
 wording in the show notes. But if any category doesn't meet that threshold, it's not awarded.

255
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,080
 And this isn't nominating votes. This is voting votes.

256
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,720
 This is obviously terrible. It might not be obviously terrible, but here's why it's terrible.

257
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,720
 What it means is that you could have a bunch of happy podcasters say to pick a random category

258
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,840
 as an example. Turn up at the Hugo Awards in their posh togs, very excited and then have them

259
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,160
 announce. Oops, we've decided not to announce this category because we didn't get quite enough votes.

260
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,520
 So nobody's won. Off you go back to your podcasting hole that nobody cares about,

261
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,080
 because 25% of them didn't vote. This is kind of odd because podcasts and critical works generally

262
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,760
 and fan works don't have the same sorts of reach or spread or marketing budgets as say novels and

263
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,120
 in particular dramatic presentations. And it seems a bit odd that this is some kind of model as to

264
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,520
 whether it's worth awarding Hugo's to them or not. I think quite a lot of people agree that even if

265
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,560
 this is a good idea in principle, this probably is the way that you would want to do it. You

266
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,720
 could create drama just by the way that the way in which you do it, which probably isn't how you

267
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,360
 would want to. So people have been thinking about what you might do about it. The original

268
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,640
 provision existed because there weren't very many Hugo votes at the time. There were maybe kind of

269
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:21,200
 500 or 600 votes for the Hugo's overall. So the 25% threshold was 150 votes or so. And it felt like

270
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,320
 if you couldn't get 150 votes for something, then maybe there wasn't a lot of interest in

271
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,480
 that amongst Worldcon attendees. But that's not the case now because we have thousands of votes

272
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,200
 for the Hugo's. They're very popular and that's great. One of the things that the

273
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:43,200
 proposals on the file 770 blog in which they talk about it note is that the 25% rule would have been

274
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,280
 591 at discount. But that is more votes than any category received in the

275
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:56,000
 Hugo's in which this rule was first proposed. And while I'm not sure I disagree that some

276
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,080
 consideration of that in the Constitution is what is, I do think that without carefully doing it,

277
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,840
 it will basically just end up with the fan categories going away by default. And because I think the

278
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,720
 fan categories are actually an important part of the Hugo Awards, I disagree with that. I am

279
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,200
 obviously wearing a hat in which I have been nominated in those categories. So perhaps I am

280
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,800
 biased. It also means the best editor long form is at risk because that gets about the same number

281
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,760
 of votes as some of the fan categories. And so it could go away under this as well. And so,

282
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,760
 yeah, I think it's wise to make sure that the Hugos are not given out by a tiny number of people

283
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,800
 just voting for their mates. But I do think that kind of, I don't know, I think anything above about

284
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 100 or 150 votes probably meets that. So I'm not sure that a 25% threshold is necessary.

285
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,280
 And striking this and kind of seeing what happens and how we could introduce new rules to prevent

286
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,720
 sort of small number statistics going forwards is probably the best way of going.

287
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,520
 I think my general view is the sufficient people still voting in the fan categories. They don't

288
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,280
 feel like they're being voted for by 12 men and a dog. So the simplest solution seems to be,

289
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,000
 let's just ditch this 25% rule and then see what we get. And you know, you'll, this still might

290
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,120
 mean hundreds and hundreds of people voting in these categories. And so that's fine. I guess in a

291
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:24,160
 kind of devil's advocate way, you could say that, you know, there are a lot of Hugo's and as things

292
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,000
 become more and more niche, should there be some way that we, you know, do decide actually this has

293
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,280
 become too niche for the Hugo electorate to really have an opinion on only a small proportion of them

294
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,200
 have any sort of opinion on it. And maybe that's a sign that they should not be

295
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,120
 Hugo's. And so looking at number of votes might be one way to to kind of assess that. But actually,

296
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,640
 I think if you do want to do something where you don't award in the lowest popularity categories,

297
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,120
 then the way to do it would be to look at the number of nominations rather than

298
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,360
 the number of votes because it's much better to say, okay, we're not having, you know, this category

299
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,920
 this year because it didn't get many nominations than to say actually we're having this category.

300
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,520
 Here are all the nominations here are the finalists. You know, they've got dressed up and come ceremony

301
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,280
 and now they don't get an award. I'd much rather did it earlier on. It seems much, you know,

302
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,680
 kinder to the people involved. So if you, if we did want something like this, I would support

303
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,200
 bringing it back at the nominations side of things. I think that probably makes sense.

304
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:29,920
 I don't think popularity is the best measure of how important a category is. I do think it's one

305
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,600
 measure, but I do think, you know, the fan categories have had a long tradition in the Hugo

306
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,760
 voting. And also, there's not, there are other awards for fan endeavors, but there's nothing that

307
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:49,760
 has the sort of reaches even the 25% of Hugo ballots. This is a much more comprehensive assessment of

308
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,800
 what fans think is good than anything else we've got in the space.

309
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:59,360
 I don't want the fan categories to go away because they're unpopular relative to novel,

310
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,560
 but if they became so unpopular that it was 12 men and a dog, I would rather see them retired

311
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:12,160
 than just be a joke. I think there is a consideration here of you need a minimum amount of investment

312
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,080
 from the Worldcon community in order for the award to make sense as a prestigious award

313
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:25,520
 awarded by the Worldcon. I don't think that number is 591. I think it's quite a long way below 591,

314
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,520
 but I saying like every category must have at least, I don't know, 100 nominations. I think that

315
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,600
 would be fair. I think below that you do run the risk. Do you mean 100 across, you mean 100 nominations

316
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,160
 or 100 nominating ballots across a category? The latter. Yeah, we get much more than that.

317
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,840
 There were 274 fan cast listed or something lost here, something like lots, lots, lots.

318
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,280
 So yes, I think bringing it back at the nomination stage is not a bad idea. Whatever happens,

319
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,040
 the earliest such a change could take effect is 2024. So if you're on the

320
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:06,320
 Chicon committee, I mean, I guess I mean Cat here, if it turns out that Best Fan cast isn't going

321
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,000
 to be awarded, do you think you could tell us at the Hugo reception or even earlier in the weekend?

322
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,360
 So that we can just kind of drink all the vodka instead of having to come to the show?

323
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,320
 If it is going to be kept in the voting, it should be announced like the day after voting

324
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,200
 closes, right? Because it should be relatively obvious if like I know that doing the count is

325
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,080
 hard, but how many ballots actually filled one of the categories in should be a relatively simple

326
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,400
 database query, right? So you could announce that very quickly after the deadline, I would have thought.

327
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,600
 I hadn't thought that about our tour. It's a very good point from Liz, because I do think at the

328
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,760
 moment it does seem unnecessarily cruel. It's just fantastically cool.

329
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,520
 I'm actually just looking at it. Best Fan cast, for instance, had more nominating ballots than

330
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:56,560
 Best Editor Short Form, Best Editor Long Form, Best Professional Artist, Best Semi-Prozine.

331
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,120
 I mean, I do think this is about marketing budgets. I mean, the overall number of ballots is driven

332
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,720
 by Disney being in every household in the world. That's the thing. Not sure it does, right? Because

333
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,480
 Best Novel is the leader and I'm not sure Disney are pushing any of the novels all that hard.

334
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,920
 I think Best I thought Best Dramatic Presentation was normally the lead. It probably varies.

335
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,640
 It probably depends how much you've got to the Hugo packet, guys. So better Hugo packets mean

336
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,800
 more votes for Best Novel. We're at nomination phase here. Oh, a nomination phase. I know,

337
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,600
 but I thought I thought Alison was making a point about how the number of votes in those categories

338
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,680
 being proportionately larger than the votes in Fan cast, despite the fact that it's not represented

339
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,520
 at nomination phase is because after the nomination phase, there's more money to spend on that.

340
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,120
 It's both nominations and it's familiarity. Oh, in that case, I disagree with you. Sorry,

341
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,160
 because I don't think the data supports that view. Okay, so Liz, you told us you'd crunched

342
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,200
 the data. Could you crunched the data? You're going to have to give me better specifications

343
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,160
 than that. I can tell you that Best Novel got way more nominating ballots than either of the

344
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,120
 Best Dramatic Presentations last year. But it's votes that count for this at the moment.

345
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,480
 Yeah, but we keep making the argument about nominations as well. So you're going to have to

346
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,320
 specify your data query and I will do it. I think I can see an argument and if this isn't the

347
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,800
 argument Alison was making, it's my idea. So I'm making it and I'm very clever. I think I can see

348
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,320
 an argument that the fact that some things get much more nominations compared to others in the

349
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,040
 nomination phase, but then that's not reflected in the vote is due to the fact that if you get

350
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,480
 something nominated for a Hugo, you might market it based on that and that might increase your

351
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,160
 number of votes. And I can see an argument that the nominations reflect much more the level of

352
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,280
 interest in the community in various categories and then the votes reflect kind of that combined

353
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,520
 with the marketing considerations of these companies that stand to benefit from this.

354
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,160
 I think that is a coherent argument. I thought that's the argument Alison was making. She's

355
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,840
 still shaking her head. So it's my idea and I'm very clever listeners.

356
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,320
 Right. Any comments from the crowd. So one of the things about human conversation is that it

357
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,280
 often goes in areas that neither of the participants, none of the participants expect at the point

358
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,040
 where you start the conversation. And then sort of the things are so good about it. This is also

359
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,080
 foreshadowing for our next episode. Yeah. Do you want to make a comment on how can I make a comment

360
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,160
 on John's actual proposal? Because I don't think it's marketing. I think where's his marketing

361
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,840
 budgets, but it's not marketing budget in a specific way. It's just that if I look at the ballot and I

362
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,400
 see five fan casts I never heard of and I see five films and I watch them in the cinema. Of course,

363
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,880
 I'm going to vote in best dramatic presentation and not vote in best fan cast. Yeah. And the reason

364
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,960
 you've seen them in the cinema is because they're huge projects with huge budgets. And a fan cast

365
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,000
 is just like a fan cast. On the obvious solution is we need cinemas to be screening afterthought.

366
00:32:52,800 --> 00:33:01,760
 No. Agreed. Fan activity is worthwhile even if it's a minority taste. Criticism as well. I think

367
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,960
 we had the best nonfiction Hugo that you were talking about last week, then I think you would

368
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,000
 see that get lower votes as well. Because it's not what everybody wants. It's fine. It doesn't

369
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,040
 mean it's not important. Anyway, so one of the ways to deal with this is to try to find convoluted

370
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:27,040
 ways of solving the problem. But I think Olav has gone for let's just scrap it and see what happens

371
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,560
 and that would also be my preference. Yeah. I mean, has it ever actually been used? I don't know

372
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,680
 actually. That is a good question. I don't believe so, but I think it's come a little bit worryingly

373
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,480
 close. This also means guys, please vote in all the minor categories and get your pals to so that

374
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,560
 we don't have this problem of not awarding. Yeah. Not awarding an award when there are massive numbers

375
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,760
 of votes. I think basically if you have a rule that was enacted in 1964 and has never actually

376
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,360
 come about, then it might be time to get rid of it and say actually, do we really, if this really

377
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,680
 doing what it was proposed to do. Hugo stats nerds write in and tell us whether this has ever been used.

378
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,320
 Picks, picks, picks, picks, picks. Liz, do you want to go first? Yeah. All right. I'm going to go first

379
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,640
 with my pick, which was going to be, you know, some TV or a book or something that you could also

380
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:28,560
 engage with. But actually, it's going to be the best purchase I've made for at least several weeks,

381
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,200
 which is a Roomba. And I have called him Kevin. Kevin the Roomba. I called him Kevin because at the

382
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,360
 moment, there's lots of adverts for the million, million film on the train I take to work in the

383
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,040
 morning. And he got there's a minion called Kevin. So I call him after that because he's just

384
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,640
 delightful. Basically, he hovers my house. I hate hoversing. So I'm very happy to have a robot who

385
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,960
 sort of bumbles about hoversing my house, but he's also just a little bit incompetent. He's second

386
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,400
 hand. So I think he's, you know, his state of the art technology was probably state of the art in

387
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,960
 about 2015. And so he's both brilliant at hoversing and also just a little bit pathetic. I pressed the

388
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,520
 dock button, which is supposed to send him back to his little charging dock to dock. And despite

389
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,880
 him being about five meters away, he went in completely the opposite direction and spent about

390
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,640
 10 minutes kind of wobbling around my office, bumping into things before coming back to the

391
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,800
 correct room and then managing to dock. And when he gets to dock about 10 centimeters away,

392
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,200
 he slows down and goes incredibly slowly. So he doesn't bump into anything and just kind of goes

393
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,880
 click and gets his little charging socket someplace. So basically, he's great. I'm going to buy him

394
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,200
 some googly eyes. And when I put the googly eyes on, I'll show you all a picture.

395
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,280
 Yes, yes. I'm very excited about this pick because I am going to buy a Roomba. I'm probably going to

396
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,560
 wait for it's it's prime day coming up and there might be a sale. And if there isn't a sale, I might

397
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,360
 wait for about Friday and get one then. But yes, I want the Roomba i3. My Roomba is a Roomba 620,

398
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,320
 if you want to know kind of what sort of technology I am dealing with here. The i3 is one of the ones

399
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:09,440
 that you can put virtual walls in your house and you can control it by Siri. So I'll be able to ask

400
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,560
 the air to do the hoovering and the air will hoover, which is a 10 out of 10 innovation.

401
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,360
 Oh, that's that's the best thing though. There's no there's no virtual walls on this one. It would

402
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,160
 do virtual walls if I built like little things to mark the walls. But I'm not doing that. I paid

403
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,400
 40 quid for the room, but I'm not spending 40 quid in a virtual wall for him. So I closed the door

404
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,440
 and then he just sort of like the sort of some sort of terrifying thing on the other side of the

405
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,120
 door. And it was kind of like, or a cat. I think I think he's heavier than a cat is the thing or

406
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,680
 certainly he like drives forward with more force than a cat would when presented with a closed door.

407
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,240
 I guess this depends very much on your cat. But it'll sort of like come along and bump on the door

408
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,840
 and then like, you know, spin around and wander off again. It's like, when's he gonna come back

409
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,400
 and bang on the door again? Yeah, it's science fiction, the future.

410
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,560
 I have a second hand Roomba, which was given to me with the instruction that I would need to buy

411
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,480
 a new battery for it because it was battery was shot and I would need to give it a good clean.

412
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,920
 And so I have bought a battery for it and I have not given it a good clean. And the next stage was

413
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,000
 going to be to get our bedroom clear enough of crap on the floor so that we could reasonably

414
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,440
 use a Roomba in it. And there this project has stalled to speed a year or something now.

415
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,240
 Oh, it is also great incentive to not leave like shoes lying around everywhere.

416
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,160
 We are relatively good about not having crap on the floor. So I'm not sure that's going to be a

417
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,200
 huge problem. Getting to know, I mean, I'm not saying that this is a problem for other people.

418
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,480
 I am merely saying it's a problem for me. So this is my explanation for what I have a Roomba,

419
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,600
 but I have not given it a name and and it's just kind of sitting in a carrier bag waiting for me

420
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,240
 to get my act together. But I mean, mine also can't cope with my coffee table because it's got like

421
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,640
 these cross like these legs in the sort of the shape of a cross. So they're a slight slope.

422
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,640
 So we can get up on the slope and then get stuck and then it just makes us sort of sad bleeping

423
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,720
 noise until you come and put them back down. So it's quite a high maintenance pet really.

424
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,600
 It's also what I needed in my life a high maintenance pet. I mean, you should get a cat, Alison.

425
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:18,240
 My pick is also technology and my pick is a stream deck. Oh, that's exciting.

426
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,600
 Now, whenever Alison goes off on one, I can press a button. I have a little automation that tells

427
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,720
 me the timestamp at which she went off on the one and then the timestamp at which we got back on

428
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,840
 track and that is going to be listeners you don't understand. Those of you who've been to live shows

429
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:42,000
 do understand, but this is game changing, I would say. But it's really good. I've pressed buttons.

430
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,040
 I made a little icons. I've made a little icon that has a little hashtag with this purple and

431
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,600
 then it has different little logos to tells me which thing it does for Octa-Thorp and I have a button

432
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,160
 and Alison, this will make you happy. I have a button that when I press it, it opens the show notes.

433
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:04,480
 Literally, all it does, just show notes there. Instantly one button, 10 out of 10. Yeah, I really

434
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,320
 like it. It's good. I've got 40 pounds off eBay because second hand things are good.

435
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,560
 I think I told you that, didn't I? Yes. Can you reconfigure one to pop up the show notes and then

436
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,960
 put it in the post to Alison? That's something that doesn't make sense to people who are the

437
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,880
 three of us, but it is very funny. So we'll be staying in the episode. Thank you, Liz.

438
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,680
 Last week listeners, I was recording at my parents' house, which is the first time I've recorded

439
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,080
 the podcast away from my desk. So episode 60 was an experiment and no one has written in, say,

440
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,520
 John sounds weird. So I think it's an experiment that went relatively well.

441
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:46,240
 Hurrah. Let's move away from boring chat and talk about the cricket. Oh, the cricket. Liz just

442
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:54,400
 made a lack of a face, held up her Kindle, and started reading. My pick this week is cricket.

443
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,480
 And the reason for that is that I have not been watching anything or reading anything apart from

444
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,600
 Hugo Books because I have been watching and listening to, in particular, the cricket.

445
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,240
 I think I was just spending too much time hanging out with people who kept

446
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,680
 incessantly talking about the cricket. And they kept going, oh, cricket, and saying cricket is fun

447
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,760
 to listen to when you're supposed to be doing other things like working. And I can confirm that

448
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,520
 this is true, that cricket is highly optimized as a sport for listening to when you're supposed

449
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,360
 to be doing something else. And there's an entire massive infrastructure has been built up around

450
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,000
 providing ways for people to experience the cricket without their boss realizing that they're

451
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,040
 experiencing the cricket. But in my case, my boss is me. So I can listen to the cricket if I like.

452
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,400
 And just to help me along my way, England decided to have a period of 13 consecutive days on which

453
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,200
 there was a test match on every day, which was quite exciting. We're still in the middle of that.

454
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,920
 Hasn't quite finished yet. However, England did not do very well yesterday. And also it rains a lot

455
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,880
 in cricket. Who do you? I will say that's not quite true. Because if you watch the cricket that's in,

456
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,080
 for instance, Dubai, it does rain quite a lot less than the cricket that happens in England for some

457
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,840
 reason. So I think it might be country specific rather than cricket specific. I feel like the

458
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,920
 rain's part of it because part of one of the things you have to take into account when judging your

459
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,960
 strategy is that it might rain randomly all the way through or a bit of the time. And that might

460
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,760
 affect how you choose to play the game. Fascinating game. Also, it's been very interesting. The last

461
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,280
 couple of weeks of cricket have been extremely interesting. Is that enough back cricket? I mean,

462
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,400
 Alison, how would you feel if I told you there was a sport where they went for like 21 consecutive

463
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,320
 days, they never got rained off and you know, no one wins until the end. They go every day.

464
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:54,240
 And also there's hours of it where nothing happens. Oh, cricket. Liz refers, of course, to the sport

465
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,240
 of cycling. I do. Oh, no, no, cycling also very, oh, cycling is great there because

466
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,920
 there really is where there's nothing happening because there's lots of things where you can kind

467
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,960
 of watch what's going on and the way in which people are gathering and cycling's also good. I

468
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,120
 have, I'm definitely up for watching cycling too. I've been watching the Formula E but I'm only

469
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,240
 halfway through, so please don't spoil the result for me. You too. I have to deliberately look it up.

470
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,360
 So, you know, it's unlikely. And that was the Oxford Thought podcast and it's goodbye from me.

471
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:34,160
 It's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me.

472
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:51,920
 I do need to say one more thing about Andrew Plockkin.

473
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,520
 Yep. Which is linked to, because I almost said in the locks bit that my previous

474
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,880
 fanzine plotter got a lock this week, which is quite good. It is never too late from somebody

475
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,920
 who was working on the archives of the things that they'd done when they were a much younger man

476
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,720
 and discovered that Plockkin had written about it once and so he tweeted out about that and

477
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,880
 somebody drew it to our attention. But also Andrew Plockkin, of course, I've known for a very long

478
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,600
 time because Plockter had an ongoing correspondence with him because of the, initially because of

479
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:29,600
 the similarity of names but also because of some collective interests around gaming and interactive

480
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:40,080
 fiction. Plockkin wrote a great interactive fiction game in which the narrator is unreliable

481
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:47,760
 called Spider and Web and it is bloody amazing. It is so good. He was my favourite

482
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,520
 interactive fiction writer when I was into IF. I mean, he is amazing. But just the idea of having a

483
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:02,000
 video game in text where the texture being shown isn't the world that you're seeing is, oh, so good.

484
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,160
 If there had been a Hugo Award for Best Video Game in 1998, it might have won.

485
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,720
 Technically, interaction fiction is not video games because there's no video in it. It's a

486
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,120
 text adventure. But that's one of the reasons why it has to be Best Game Hugo because interactive

487
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,800
 fiction is still a vibrant category of gaming in which you could well imagine something might

488
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,880
 turn up for the Hugo. I've got a question now. Sorry, we went off of one. Yeah, I'm now also

489
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,720
 wondering, like, since Plockter is presumably dormant, maybe to rise again in our hour of need,

490
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,320
 but not imminently. Does that mean that any future Plockter lets a comment will get

491
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,600
 read down Octothop instead? Probably not. I only did it because the Plockkin stuff came up as well,

492
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:50,240
 so. So that was two Hugo, two Plockter shout outs. I will just confirm that the interactive fiction

493
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,320
 referred to would have qualified as a video game under the rules of the Discon 3 video game Hugo.

494
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,760
 Find it as games available on personal computers. So, yes. Yeah, what if I have like a

495
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,520
 choose-you-run adventure book and I read it kind of as an ebook to then become a video game?

496
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:15,360
 My core argument for why you can't differentiate is because there are many examples of games which

497
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:21,840
 have both a physical form and also being sold as video game form.

498
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,240
 And my assertion is, unless you are playing interactive fiction through a device that has no

499
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,880
 GUI, you are playing a video game. Okay, so am I the only one of the three of us who has played

500
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,920
 quite a lot of interactive fiction through devices without GUI? No, because I had, well,

501
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,240
 I don't know. Does it count as a GUI if I could load the menu up on my BBC master?

502
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,160
 I played all of my interactive fiction on Windows and Macs PCs.

503
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,720
 Yeah, okay. But basically, these games played on computers that did not have GUIs.

504
00:45:50,720 --> 00:46:12,720
 The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin MacLeod in Com
