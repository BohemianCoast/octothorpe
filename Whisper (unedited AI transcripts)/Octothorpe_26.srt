1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 There's no good word for a video podcast, that is vlog.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,560
 Just take video, just take video, let's just take video.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,520
 Anyway, I think you might find something that's fun in all of that.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,480
 *snort*

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,160
 Baby, figures crossed.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,160
 Alternative episode title.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,640
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 26th episode of the Octa Thought podcast.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,920
 This episode will be going out on the 4th of March 2021 and I'm John Coxon.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,160
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,000
 And we have some letters of comment for you all this week.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,800
 So firstly, I'm going to start with a letter of comment from Roman Ozanski who

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,800
 thought we did not particularly fairly treat the NK jemisin novel,

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,720
 the city we became, because we said things about it but none of us have read it.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,360
 So I've got two reactions to this which is firstly, all I was doing was reporting that my wife

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,640
 didn't think it was great and that does affect my opinions on whether or not I'm probably going

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,680
 to read a book. If other people do not take opinions from their loved ones then that's fine.

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,680
 But I do. Secondly, I have started reading the book and although I am enjoying it,

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,000
 there have been multiple times so far when I've been reading it and I've read a sentence and I've

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,440
 been like, "Oh, that's not what I was imagining. I've clearly missed a bit."

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,800
 And I've gone back several pages to be like, "Where did she establish this thing that's happening?"

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,160
 And she just hasn't. And so it is, I'm finding it incredibly jarring in a way that I haven't found

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,680
 any of her previous works. I'm wondering whether that's something other people encountered when

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,640
 they read it. But yeah, like so there's a pipe where someone at a bike shop starts talking to the

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,280
 main character but at no point has it been established that he's standing near a bike shop.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
 And so it's just like the bike attendant starts talking, it's like, "What bike attendant? Where did

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,400
 they come from? Why are they there? Where are their bikes?" And you just weren't any before and

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,240
 so you weren't imagining any bikes and there's nothing there are bikes and you have to readjust

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:19,040
 the scene in your head. And I am finding that very odd. But since last time I also read,

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,200
 Piranese, which is excellent, but feels more like a long novella than a short novel, I would say.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,880
 And I've also read the third murder bot novella in preparation for reading the murder bot novel,

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,640
 which I believe is eligible this year. And I also thoroughly enjoyed that.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,240
 "Didn't you also read another book?"

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,600
 I read "Space Between Worlds" by Mackiah Johnson. I can't remember if I said I had read that last

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,000
 time because time is an illusion and reading time w so. But no, the space between worlds is amazing.

35
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,720
 I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked it better than Piranese, I think. It and the vanished birds are

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,760
 definitely the two best books I've read so far that have been published in 2020. I will be

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,840
 enthusiastically nominating both. And if the jemmison stays at the same quality as it has done so far,

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
 I suspect I will like it less than those two. But it might be that it picks up later in the

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
 book because I'm only about a quarter of the way throughout the moment.

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,800
 I think I am more sympathetic to Roman's point than you are, partly because I am not

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,040
 bothered about what your wife thinks about books. But also because I tried to think, well,

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,520
 what if I was listening to Roman on a podcast about a book? Are you really, really liked? And he

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,240
 hadn't read and he didn't really say anything that I spanned it. So he, I think he has a point

44
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,560
 there, but we also said a bit more. I think we also sort of segued into a discussion of

45
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,720
 fix-ups and our general not-in-termment of fix-up novels without really being clear about

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,520
 fix-ups or the fact that we've gone on to a kind of more general topic.

47
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,920
 Claire Braley of Croydon, right? I'd rather people thought I drink too much than that I have poor

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,400
 taste in reading. And I'm sure nobody would think either of those two things, Claire.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,840
 I know for a fact that Claire has liked books that other people didn't like on occasion. So,

50
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,120
 how do you respond to these accusations? Claire, please write in with your next letter of

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,280
 comment and tell us about the subjectivity of art. I actually sent us a very long letter,

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,280
 so thank you very much, but we're not going to read out all of it because we have many topics

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,080
 to cover today. But she did also write us some poetry for Liz. I think Liz has to read out the

54
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,840
 poetry. Claire says, "I'm surprised that Flanders and Swan didn't conclude geckos in their best

55
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,800
 jury. I'm slightly worried at this point. This is me not Claire, that I'm now going to have to explain

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,960
 to John who Flanders and Swan were." "It is a poem especially for me."

57
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,920
 Octa-thorpe Poetry Corner. "I'm sliding down the wall and not liking it at all. When did you get

58
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,040
 that anti-gecko spray? I'm just here in your abode to catch the latest episode of the Octa-thorpe

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,760
 podcast, as we say. Back in the skirting board till you're ready to record, I've been hoping you

60
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,400
 might mention me on air. I've been a long-term fan and I don't deserve this ban, so I'm writing

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,960
 in to say that it's not fair. I only made a chirp when I was startled by that burp and you've had

62
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,920
 much bigger problems with the sound. But if I develop fur and then try to learn to purr, is there any

63
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:17,520
 chance you'll let me stick around?" "Oh." "Thank you, Claire. I will also say that my anti-gecko spray

64
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,240
 is apparently a nasty smell that they don't like and so they won't go near it. The idea is it stops

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,000
 from coming in because you put a kind of smell they don't like you don't like. It doesn't actually

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,480
 make them slide down the wall like anti-climb pain to anything, although that would be very funny."

67
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,280
 "While I was distinct to that poem, I realised I have to do an art for this podcast, which is

68
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,640
 basically some geckos on a wall that says this wall has been treated with anti-gecko spray."

69
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:49,200
 "Good poem, thank you, Claire." "Yes, thank you, Claire. I enjoyed the return of poetry con."

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:56,720
 "Yay." "Other people can also join in by sending us poetry." "Yes, we want Chris Garcia to send us a poem.

71
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,760
 On the subject of Chris Garcia, he writes that he is in fact a multitasker. It's rare that he doesn't

72
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,520
 have two films running in the selection process, a podcast and a conversation with a child."

73
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,360
 "Hang on, yeah this is for this episode, yeah cool. Time is blurring together."

74
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,600
 "Because unlike Chris, John is not a multitasker."

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,120
 "I mean I'm not even a single tasker, so there's the hat."

76
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,360
 "Right now he's listening to Eltathorp watching wrestling and listening to John Paul

77
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
 retail the plot from the regeneration to the fifth doctor. He's not seen the episode and thus he's

78
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,960
 fairly certain he's getting the details slightly wrong about how the poor patrol intervened.

79
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,160
 Although I do thoroughly look forward to the doctor who poor patrol crossover."

80
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,200
 "Yeah, I mean that sounds good."

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,800
 "Yeah, I don't have any, I'd love to have some witty follow-up but I literally

82
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,040
 I know nothing about poor patrol."

83
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:56,880
 "That's fair, he spells Alison name wrong. He's going to be an easier con, which is a great alternate

84
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,560
 name for EasterCon, which I love and he's eaten chicken mole pancakes. So you know I'm going to

85
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
 have to give that a try at some point."

86
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,360
 "I think I mean chicken mole pancakes don't you?"

87
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:17,280
 "Yes, true. And finally, so and Rosin says that when Alison last episode mentioned that she had

88
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,640
 Stephen and Jonathan wandering around and suspects that neither Stephen nor Jonathan sleeps on Alison's

89
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:28,800
 desk. Alison, can you confirm or deny?" "Um, cannot confirm or deny that."

90
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:37,040
 "Okay, weird. And and does not log any books, films, TV series, cats crochet or podcasts.

91
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,520
 But she did then follow that up with a tweet to us in which she showed us her big old traditional

92
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,040
 notebook of reading, which has is basically just a list of handwritten agatha-christianophils."

93
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,520
 "Hah, isn't that a log?"

94
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,840
 "I mean, yes, this is what she says in her tweet. She says, 'I made a fallacious claim. I do log

95
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,240
 books, but only series and mainly tried to stop myself buying electronic duplicates,

96
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,400
 which doesn't always work.' And I replied and said, 'That is also the main reason I log

97
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,880
 books and movies to stop myself buying duplicates and also it doesn't always work.'

98
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,400
 "I'm trying to be in trial at this site for Andrew's secret code. I presume which is like

99
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,520
 P for Poirot maybe?" "Yeah, that would make sense. Yeah, murder on the Orient and express

100
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,040
 as a P so that that seems consistent." "Okay, and then the ends might be

101
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:40,160
 Marple." "Octothorp, the podcast of codebreaking." "Oh yeah, because I see there's a P that's

102
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,160
 labelled 'Hercu Poirot' as Christmas, so yeah. But then there's lots of Ks and As, so

103
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,040
 Andrew, please send us a follow-up tweet to explain your secret code of Agatha-Christies."

104
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:59,200
 So my favourite line from Andrew's log is the following line. N or M?

105
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,960
 "T and T K." "I leave it as an exercise for the listener to work out which part is the book title,

106
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,360
 which part is the tag and which part is the andg notation." "I write my journal in whole

107
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,640
 sentences by and large with very few abbreviations of any kind and I still go back in years later

108
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,760
 and go, 'What on earth was this about?' 'I don't think I'd do very well with

109
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,280
 vigorous abbreviations. I've just been completely lost.' And I also, one of the nice things about

110
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,480
 middle age is that it doesn't really matter whether you forget that you've already read

111
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,680
 things and read them again because you can enjoy them just as much the second time

112
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,520
 whilst your memory is completely shot. Yay! And also mentions that she has volunteered for

113
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,200
 EasterCon and this is a sort of segue you see. I've never really used them before but I'm

114
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,000
 told they can be particularly effective. So EasterCon peeps. It has been three weeks since the last

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,040
 EasterCon weekly video. But there's only one, all right, like there's only been one video so far,

116
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,680
 right? So it's not really a weekly video. No, no, there were two videos. There is a video that says

117
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,800
 we will be releasing weekly videos full of content telling you what's going on with convention

118
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,360
 and then within a week of that they released a video with zero content saying everything was

119
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,520
 under control. So, yes, they said they were going to do a podcast and we are still eagerly waiting

120
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,360
 for episode two. They said they were going to do a podcast but when they think about a podcast is

121
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,800
 that there are audio's not videos, I'm like tilting up with Mills here. Possibly. I think...

122
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,720
 Well, I mean the other alternative is we call it a vodcast and no one wants that.

123
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,080
 Yes, that's true. What I think we're trying to say is that some of us want to plan for our Easter

124
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,560
 weekend and in particular some of us are in a position where we've been asked to do tasks by

125
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,120
 the EasterCon and like for example, I'm a deal... I'm planning to sell stuff at EasterCon and

126
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,000
 in order to trade I want to know how the dealer's room is going to work and what we get so far is

127
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,520
 kind of note saying the dealer's room is going to be amazing but we won't tell you what's happening

128
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,640
 yet or what you need to do or how you need to prepare and that is becoming difficult because we

129
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,480
 don't have very long left and I've also been asked to do a job by the EasterCon and I've kind of gone

130
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,160
 well yes in principle but until I know how your platform is working I really don't know what the

131
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,040
 job you're asking me to do is going to look like in the context of a virtual convention. It's a job

132
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,080
 that we do it though, we've done it regular conventions but it's obviously going to be different

133
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,640
 at a virtual convention so that's all quite... we get into the stage where resolving that sort of

134
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,200
 stuff along with everything else in our lives, not that there is anything else in our lives but

135
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,880
 you know there we go. Within the amount of time we have left before Easter is becoming worrying

136
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,280
 and difficult and if you say agree to do something you kind of would prefer to have the time and

137
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,440
 space to do it really well and that's the thing that's worrying me at the moment.

138
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,720
 In more positive news I've had my £20 refund from EasterCon for the difference between my attending

139
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,120
 and my virtual membership and I immediately spent it on a board game so hurrah as promised

140
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,400
 the coxing guarantee. It's the circulating economy. What board game did you spend it on John?

141
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,240
 I spent it on a game called Star crossed so Star crossed is a game that is played with a

142
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,440
 Jenga tower or an off-brand Jenga tower other brands are available mine is from John Lewis and

143
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:48,240
 you play a couple who are engaging in some sort of conversation or some sort of scene and every

144
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,920
 time you make an emotional bid you pull a block from the Jenga tower and when the Jenga tower falls

145
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
 you must act on your emotions wherever your emotions have gotten to by that point in the game

146
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,480
 and it sounds fascinating and I am excited to play it. Is this a two-player game? It is a two-player

147
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:10,400
 game. Yeah so that's quite nice. Okay so I have a massive fondness for games that use the equipment

148
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,760
 from other games. This is with my buy nothing hat. Games that assume that you will have things

149
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,800
 like counters and dice and monopoly money and Jenga towers around your house. I specifically bought

150
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,600
 a Jenga tower to play this and another game called Dread and I have no intent of ever using it to

151
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,840
 actually play Jenga. Oh dear. Well Jenga's quite a good game. Oh I was gonna say have you played

152
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,640
 fog of love. Fog of love. Yes I have played fog of love. This very much sounds like the Jenga.

153
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:44,400
 This sounds like the love child of a game called Dread which is a horror RPG in which whenever you

154
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,880
 take an action you pull a block from the tower and when the tower falls one of the players die

155
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,400
 which is a very effective mechanic for running horror RPGs and there is a game called Fog of

156
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,960
 Love which is another two-player game which revolves around relationships and exploring them

157
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,160
 and that's based around a kind of card based almost legacy based mechanic and Starcross does

158
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,280
 seem like the kind of interjection of the Venn diagram of those two games but I have played both

159
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,160
 and they are both very good so I'm excited about Starcross. Yes I thought when you said it I was like

160
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,640
 oh if John likes the sound of that he would love fog of love and you did love fog of love so it's

161
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,720
 all good and I've said love about 17 times now. So and we have now done our obligatory gaming content.

162
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,520
 Highmark. I do have something else to say about EasterCon which is that they announced in

163
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:39,040
 that the dealers they are charging dealers 20 pounds to be a dealer but if you're a member

164
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,560
 that's included so it's like a dealers table is included in membership but if you want

165
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,120
 just be a dealer they are selling dealers only tickets which is oh that's interesting.

166
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,040
 Kind of strange and it does make me worry that they that they do want me to spend eight hours a day

167
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,360
 in in some kind of virtual space which is the thing that Canzeland tried to do and then roll

168
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,000
 back on when they realized it wasn't a very sensible idea because it doesn't really work because you

169
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,920
 want to be in other places at the same time but you can be in some other places at the same time

170
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,600
 so it might work. They've also said dealers are going to get some stuff on program and they can do

171
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,920
 literally anything they like with their program space except a reading which made me think two

172
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,200
 things. The first was what if what if you're selling tarot cards? Are you allowed to do a reading then?

173
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,400
 That's not that sort of reading but yeah so the first thing it made me think was well if I have

174
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,120
 some program space to do anything I like in I'm good through a party because that's what I do

175
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,480
 so there will be a Stoshurts party at the EasterCon and it will be an officially sanctioned bit of

176
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,200
 program though they don't know it yet. Also it may be think oh I want to have a reading so there will

177
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,320
 be a Stoshurts party and there will be a reading at it because we're explicitly not allowed to

178
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,240
 so if you're an author and you'd like to read something at my Stoshurts party it should be

179
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,640
 probably quite short like about ten minutes or you could do poetry poetry would be great so if

180
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:11,840
 somebody if one of our listeners would like to write an EasterCon related poem that I can read

181
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,360
 out at the Stoshurts party that would be fantastic. That does imply that EasterCon have a platform

182
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,120
 of sufficient granularity that you can easily kind of confine the activity the dealers are able to do

183
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,240
 to only their dealers room and program room and presumably not not the rest of the convention

184
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:36,160
 otherwise everyone would be buying a 20-quid dealers membership. Possibly yeah. I mean I don't

185
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,960
 I think you could trust science fiction fans by large to do the right thing. I think you can

186
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,400
 but I think if someone says well the dealers are paying 20-quid to be dealers and they get

187
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,520
 access to everything that I get access to except that I pay 50 quid then. Well I don't think they do

188
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,040
 do though they they get access they get to be on a single program item in the same way that I think

189
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,800
 they've announced that BSFA nominees will be able to attend the awards ceremony but they don't

190
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,280
 generally have access to the convention. I think as this is point right like that that employs a

191
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,200
 platform like we wouldn't have been able to do that up on graduation because as soon as a dealer

192
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,560
 was in the bit where they could plug their wares they would have been able to access everything

193
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,200
 else as well. You'd almost think that we would have an honest system and that science fiction

194
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,600
 fans are by a large honourable. I think you could run a science fiction convention virtually with

195
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 the honest system. I think there's absolutely no requirement to have a physical paywall because

196
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,640
 our members just they'll do what they know they should and a couple might not and and then we'll

197
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,520
 just kind of ignore them or shame them as we do. But my mind so I think my point here is that

198
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,760
 what I'm saying is either they have a either they have something which gates you off or basically

199
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,280
 they're saying you can pay us 20 quid and they get exactly the same as you do for 50 quid

200
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,440
 if you say if you're a dealer right. So basically they're giving dealers a reduced cost to incentivize

201
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,280
 them to deal but then you're kind of like well what is the kind of value I get for the 30 quid.

202
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,200
 Did sort of see what I'm getting at we know nothing about their platform but then I'm starting to

203
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,280
 infer things based on how they are obviously setting up and running their convention which

204
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,840
 makes me intrigued into how they have presumably solved this problem which I think most of the

205
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,520
 conventions have not tried to do of having different classes of members with access to different things.

206
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:21,680
 On the subject of Alison's poetry readings next episode will be the anniversary episode of

207
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,800
 Octa Thorpe and I am announcing without having conferred with either of my co-hosts that we will

208
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,800
 be publishing a poetry anthology as a zine so if you want to write poems for the anthology please

209
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,560
 send them to the usual address. I'll lay out you don't have to do any work.

210
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,480
 That's a smashing idea. That's why I announced it without discussing it with you.

211
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,200
 I mean if I had something that would have to do any work then that's fine.

212
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,480
 Remember clear hues and limericks guys if you don't think you're necessarily a natural poet.

213
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,560
 Yep. There's still there's plenty of forms that have your name on it.

214
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,840
 Since last time there has been a thing that happened in that Disc on 3 disinvited a guest of honour

215
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,000
 and we have linked in our show notes to John Scalzi and his vague and official pronouncement

216
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,680
 about a thing and the reason we have linked to that is because we may or may not have thoughts

217
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,760
 about this but we are probably not going to go into detail about those thoughts due to the

218
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,800
 potential forness of the said thoughts on the part of various of the co-hosts and so

219
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,040
 we know it happened. We you know there are also people discussing it.

220
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,000
 File 770 has had some excellent roundups. Go and engage with the rest of the fandom.

221
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,120
 I did actually write something about this on my facebook which we can also put a link to

222
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,800
 if for people who are my facebook friends and if you're not my facebook friend then you know

223
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,600
 you could always friend me and say you listen to what to thought.

224
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
 But what I was trying to do when I wrote my thing on facebook was essentially

225
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,120
 do what Scalzi did but obviously I am much less of a good writer than he is and so I didn't

226
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,840
 do this good job of it and so I fermented a row and one of the facebook does not let you turn

227
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,560
 comments off and Scalzi very cleverly turned comments off on his pronouncement and his explanation for

228
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,520
 why he turned comments off was because I probably want to use this again another time which I thought

229
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,240
 was quite right to. I mean I think the point here is that presumably Scalzi had within a minute of

230
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,200
 the announcement a bunch of people asking him on twitter when you're going to write something

231
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,800
 about this and what's your opinion whereas I think we should say that no one has asked for our

232
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,680
 opinion. It just feels a bit weird to be to be saying oh we're linking to Scalzi saying and we

233
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,080
 feel the same way but we have not actually had a clamor of people asking for our opinions which

234
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,680
 is what what you'd expect. You know it just it just feels slightly odd to me. It's just me.

235
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,040
 [Music]

236
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,280
 Pico-com. Oh Pico-com was great! I hit people with fish! I did not get their informed

237
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,360
 consent first I just went to slap them with fish. So Pico-com happened last weekend as we record

238
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:11,040
 which was the 21st of February and Pico-com was quite good. It was a discord and crowdcast I/O

239
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,600
 convention. They had some panels which I went to a couple of and a pub quiz which was good but they

240
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,200
 also had my personal highlights of the convention which was fish slapping. You could donate money

241
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,600
 in order to receive Pico coins and you could spend your Pico coins on fish and then you could slap

242
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,320
 people with a fish and there was also scavenger hunt which ate my day. It ate my entire Saturday

243
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,640
 and it ate a Spaniard's entire Saturday too. We were on different teams for the Scam Phan.

244
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:46,880
 It was very good. And it ate my entire Saturday and I learned how to sing barbershop by myself

245
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,960
 on zoom a lot and then make videos of it and put it on youtube and they're all unlisted for

246
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,080
 which I think the world can be very grateful and I learned a lot of other things. I was struck by

247
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:05,040
 the number of items you needed for the scavenger hunt which were available within easy reach of my

248
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,960
 computer downstairs which does slightly worrying me about it. I'm worried about the amount of

249
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,640
 clutter I have in the house I think. Do we need to, will our audience understand why Pico

250
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,400
 Con had fish slapping or do we need to explain the fish slapping? Liz give us the history lesson

251
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,080
 because you weren't at this Pico Con but you've been to other Pico cons. I will say that Pico Con,

252
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,000
 it must have been the first science fiction convention I ever went to. I think in 2003.

253
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,360
 Wow and for as long as I've been going for some reason there is always an item on the program

254
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,760
 which is labeled, what is it labeled now? Harmless fun. For as long as I've been going there's always

255
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,800
 been an item on the program labeled Harmless fun and what Harmless fun turns out to be is

256
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,800
 some representatives of ICSF and I think other university science fiction societies

257
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,760
 basically hitting each other with fish. I don't know why. Never dared ask why but basically

258
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,640
 you go out to the quad at some point and some people hit each other with fish. In January of

259
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,280
 February in the UK which means it's probably not the most fun activity for the people who are

260
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,800
 getting slapped with fish I would understand. I was going to say I listened to do it before

261
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,120
 it became the fish slapper but presumably Pico Con started after you were a student and so you

262
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,880
 never took part in the actual fish slapping. Okay so here's the really astonishing thing about Pico

263
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,160
 Con which is this was Pico Con 38 automata which means that Pico Con actually started before I was

264
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,760
 a student or just as I was a student but certainly before I was traveling to other science fiction

265
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,120
 societies to a slapfish. It is certainly the sort of thing I might have done as a student and

266
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,120
 thereafter. I think Paul Treadaway they weren't fish slapping at the very beginning I don't think.

267
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,000
 Paul Treadaway thinks he was one of the very first fish slappers and he was obviously slapping for

268
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,440
 cusses so yeah so I mean this is fan history we're actually doing fan history now so I know that a

269
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:10,240
 lot of our listeners are into fan history but I think really Rob Hanson or Mark Plummer could

270
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:18,480
 maybe do an exhaustive study of fish mutilation at British conventions. I went to Pico Con in 2007

271
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,240
 which I believe is where I met Liz for the first time and I believe was my second or third convention

272
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,040
 and it was a lot of fun and the fish slapping was very confusing and the scavenger hunt was good and

273
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,360
 there was beer. There's also and they didn't make this virtual and I thought it was a bit of a shame

274
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,000
 they'd also traditionally have the destruction of dodgy merchandise and I feel like that is something

275
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,040
 we could take virtual. And also I've never really been because I understand it's funny but also it

276
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,760
 always just seems a little bit wasteful but maybe that's just me being a stuck in the mud,

277
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,640
 stick in the mud. Listeners write in and tell me whether I should have used a you or an I, sorry Liz.

278
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,880
 It does raise quite a lot of money for charity though. They raised a thousand pounds for charity

279
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:04,080
 pretty much entirely through selling electronic fish. A whale cost 100 Pico coins which meant you

280
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,360
 had to donate 100 pounds to charity. At least three people bought whales which were horrifically

281
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,040
 imbalanced. They only put the whale in as a joke. None of the other fish cost more than a couple of

282
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,520
 quid. They were not expecting anybody to buy whales. So the fact they sold multiple whales is brilliant

283
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,160
 and there was also a leaderboard for who had lost the most hit points because you go into

284
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,440
 negative hit points so by the end someone had minus two thousand hit points. I like in particular

285
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,640
 that they sold whales to whale. Yeah I was going to say that is particularly well named isn't it?

286
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,840
 You can't we get the most money from? But other than that tell me more about pico coins. It was

287
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,600
 discord and crowdcast. Crowdcast is a private you register and then you get a private link

288
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,560
 so it can be paid or unpaid and you have a stream with with associated chat. It's fine. It seemed okay.

289
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:03,840
 It had like the advantage over punctuation was that it all came off the same crowdcast link which

290
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,040
 you got emailed so it meant that you weren't constantly having to find new YouTube links.

291
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,800
 I think the disadvantage from punctuation was that I'm not sure crowdcast has like a TV app

292
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,120
 that says widespread as YouTube's so if you wanted to watch it on your TV it would have been

293
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,200
 very slightly harder but in general I think it was a slightly different set of trade-offs to

294
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,920
 what we did with punctuation and but I think it went fine. I think it was a very similar model of

295
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:36,720
 convention. I think their discord usage was probably better than punctuation. I think if we

296
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,200
 have a run on another punctuation my inclination would be that we would want to talk to them about

297
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,040
 perhaps poaching some of their people because they did have a lot of really cool stuff happening

298
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,640
 on their discord in terms of like interactivity which I thought was really good. It felt exactly

299
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,040
 like pico corn. It really did like it was the closest. I thought that was amazing and I don't

300
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:05,040
 think anyone's quite managed that trick. It really I had just the same sense that I do

301
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,480
 with a pico corn. There were author talks for me to ignore though in fact I did listen to one

302
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,200
 and a half of them and then remember why I don't normally go to the author talks at pico and they

303
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,200
 had the author panel and it just they just did the whole convention in that way and it was lovely.

304
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,960
 Really had a fantastic time and I went to get my vaccination in the middle of it which you then

305
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,760
 used in the scavenger hunt. So yeah I then used the vaccination as good news for the scavenger hunt

306
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,600
 and then I think I might have been very dopey at the pub quiz. In fact I know I was very

307
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,440
 dope. Apologies to all my team members. We came second in the pub quiz because I was I was super

308
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,880
 dopey because I just had a vaccination. How did they run the pub quiz? They did it. You had a

309
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,000
 table on discord and you were in voice chat on discord and then you had the quiz was happening

310
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,680
 through a stream on Crowdcast. So it's like basically having it split across two different platforms

311
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:05,200
 which I think worked really well and it's a good use for discord tables so when you said oh we

312
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,960
 might not use discord tables for punctuation next time I was actually thinking well we might use

313
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:20,800
 them for something just like that. Yes and that really neatly segues into our write up of punctuation

314
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,680
 that we published over the last couple of days as we record and there will be links in the show

315
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,960
 notes. So we've published two blog posts on the punctuation website. We published a financial

316
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:39,360
 report and we published a feedback report and yeah there is there is three graphs split across

317
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:48,240
 these two blog posts so graph fans like fill your boots. Yeah so to summarise the financial

318
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,920
 report and feedback report it went pretty well. We had a lot of fun. We made quite a bit of money

319
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,560
 for charity though if we thought about selling virtual quails we maybe have made some more

320
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,520
 and we'll probably do it again sometime or not and we are holding some of the money in case we do

321
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,080
 it again and if we don't do it again we'll give that money to charity in the same proportions as we

322
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:15,280
 did before. So it's going to slightly more detail we took £985 and 20 Australian dollars so pretty

323
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:22,960
 much £1000. We spent about 300 of that on holding the convention and we have about 700 pounds left

324
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:32,400
 over which we're splitting as Alison described so our £5 member was plenty to cover any costs

325
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:39,680
 that we incurred and in terms of what people thought of the convention most things were rated on average

326
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,720
 are for or higher. There are a few things that weren't which I kind of go into more detail on

327
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,200
 in the post that's linked in the show notes. Three other things that jump out are firstly people

328
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,000
 didn't find the set a new table feature useful as Alison describes but it might be that if we had

329
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,440
 a more targeted use for that that would change. People didn't like I think people thought the

330
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,000
 virtual combatges were kind of neat but Jim really didn't think they were amazing and I think

331
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,160
 we need to think about the effort to pay off ratio at future conventions and people didn't

332
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:20,720
 think it was easy enough to or sorry people didn't like that we split the chat during panels between

333
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,640
 YouTube and Discord and a lot of people said you just need to pick one but obviously when we talk

334
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,080
 to people about which one was you pick they all disagreed so yes there is that and I go into

335
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,440
 kind of some thinking about that in the post as well but yeah in general people rated us very

336
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,360
 very strongly across most categories which was very gratifying and we're glad people enjoyed the

337
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:49,680
 convention. I think the thing I took away from this is that running a virtual convention is really

338
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,400
 extremely cheap a lot cheaper than I thought it would be actually I thought we might need more

339
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,640
 zoom licenses and more little costs that we didn't have. I mean if you took out using poll

340
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,960
 everywhere which as we say cost is quite a chunk of money and we only use for a few program items

341
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:12,720
 you could probably run most of the convention for about 120 quid so if anyone is thinking of doing

342
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,040
 a small virtual convention and you're thinking about what money you need to charge to do that

343
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,640
 you can think about the fact if you're prepared to kind of put some money up front you might be able

344
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,040
 to do it basically based off the tip chart or nothing at all. So that's what you fancy but there

345
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,800
 were obviously you know depending on the size of the convention when there probably were places

346
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,560
 we could have spent more money like we could have had guest savannah in which case we would then

347
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,720
 want to reward them in some way that would cost us money. I mean we charge people to fire just

348
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,560
 because less than a fire it doesn't really seem like a reasonable amount of money to even bother

349
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:52,400
 collecting and I think then you just lose most of it in like processing charges and fees but it was

350
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:58,160
 definitely more way more than we need to actually run a single convention on this model. No it's

351
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,280
 it's worth pointing out that we spent with the exception of Paul Everworth we spent 120 pounds

352
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:11,600
 on like the zoom and stream yard and wordpress site but we also spent 120 pounds on like payment

353
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,720
 processing so like depending on how you do your payments you might be able to make that cheaper

354
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,520
 but that was by far our biggest expense as it turns out but in terms of like if you can get like a

355
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,600
 bunch of people just like pay power use some money and you can ignore the specter of payment

356
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,360
 processing yeah 120 pounds is like you can do it for that with about 200 people which is pretty good

357
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,520
 and discord cost us eight pounds and that was because we thought we might want more emoji than

358
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,640
 we actually did so that was quite cheap so if you're wondering why does every convention use discord

359
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,200
 is because it's so cheap like you don't understand how cheap it is to run a convention on discord

360
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,000
 so cheap let's um let's do another con sometime yes washing my thought was hope etc yeah this

361
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,720
 episode is episode 26 and next episode is the anniversary of octorp and so we thought we'd

362
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,200
 wrap up this episode by doing a sort of year retrospective of what we've been doing to stay sane

363
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:13,760
 in the apocalypse this might be very gloomy i'm not entirely sure i've stayed sane i think i may have

364
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:22,880
 reassessed my sense of what sanity consists of and we we're kind of like this oh we might be

365
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,720
 getting towards the end of all this now although we might not and they might be

366
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,480
 de-restricting everything in the summer except that maybe it still won't be safe to do some of the

367
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,200
 things you like to do and it's all um i've kind of got very used to living in a house and never going

368
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,600
 out and doing things on computers i never seeing anyone and i kind of go how did i ever find time

369
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,960
 to say spend a couple of hours traveling to a place in order to do a thing and then spend a

370
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,960
 couple of hours traveling home again why would anyone do that so that's going to take some

371
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:01,040
 readjustment i think i'm gonna be um one of those annoying pricks now uh so what have i been doing

372
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:08,080
 to stay sane in the apocalypse well um i've learned spanish um so i've been doing spanish lessons

373
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,160
 with my sister-in-law every week and i've been doing my duolingo i do not have the streak that

374
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:20,160
 claire brianley has uh because no one does she's got a massive streak claire brianley is an amazing

375
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:26,720
 streaker it's true she is an amazing streaker um how big is this streak because i'm i'm not 1,200

376
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:35,920
 days oh it's quite big yep mine is two because i lost it to the day um it was about 100 one of the

377
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:42,000
 things i've learned to lockdown is the time terrible at streaking um i was actually voted person most

378
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,320
 likely in my year to streak through university campus when i was in sixth form true fact so um i

379
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,240
 find your lingo streaks a bit tricky because like they come and they go and you can repair them and

380
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,400
 there are little things you can get that protect them so i don't treat them anywhere near as seriously

381
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,360
 as i treat the streaks that go away when you lose them and so i find that my duolingo streak is much

382
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,120
 less good than my um exercise streak on my appwatch which is currently about a thousand and 20 days

383
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,000
 so in lockdown i've also been i've also been exercising every day which is something i hadn't

384
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,080
 been doing prior so i run three domes a week and i lift weights twice a week and i do apple fitness

385
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,480
 plus so i do yoga or core strength or high intensity interval training uh and i do those in various

386
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,240
 quantities through the week um so i am currently thinner than i have been since i left home um which

387
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:40,160
 is quite good and i've never been fitter um i uh i've um i've learned how to write ios apps i've

388
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,080
 been doing the hundred days of swift course uh by paul hudson i've been doing that every day and i'm

389
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,960
 currently on a 56 day streak with that uh and so i've written some apps i wrote a duck with louis

390
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,520
 calculator and i've written a alcohol intake tracker um which is quite fun and i've been doing

391
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,640
 various things and it's and i've really enjoyed um learning kind of proper software development

392
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:10,000
 um uh people who listen may know i'm a physicist by trade and i write python um mostly in my day job

393
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,120
 but that's kind of more um uh procedural programming and so doing ui based programming has been a

394
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:25,440
 really interesting uh shift um i've also been upping my reading um and i've been journaling both of

395
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,720
 which i found very um restful and so yeah um i i really like the apocalypse and i know that makes

396
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,440
 me an annoying prick but um i am i am flourishing uh i'm not sure if i'm sane but i'm not sure i was

397
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,080
 sane before so yeah i don't know but sorry to everyone listening who wants to punch me now uh

398
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:51,280
 when we're back in person feel free yeah that was quite annoying so each other i mean i can't

399
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,200
 yeah that's one of the reasons why i've been less vocal about the stakes saying in the apocalypse

400
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,920
 segments on the podcast because i'm like what i'm basically doing is doing enough things that i

401
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,440
 don't have to think about how awful the world is and that is probably an unhealthy coping mechanism

402
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:14,000
 but it manifests as an annoying prick yeah probably is yeah um have you considered writing a meta streak

403
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,400
 app such that you can then log all your streaks on your meta streak app and get a streak of streaks

404
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,200
 so yes liz i do indeed have that oh god i will post a link to it oh you've already got one oh geez

405
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:35,920
 okay i'm sorry i'm so sorry um but this is why when fitness and stuff came up on the third row

406
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,680
 uh discord i was like have you considered streaks and um i think uh i got the impression they don't

407
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,160
 work for everyone but they very much work for me as it turns out yeah they didn't work for me at all

408
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,240
 which is why i had to mute that discussion because it's all like have you tried streaks it's like

409
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,080
 yes i have tried streaks they didn't work um i also know that you run your life by reminders

410
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,360
 you can you don't need to put this on the podcast i know you run your life by reminders because

411
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,000
 basically every week you say oh we can play al Capora this time next week then and i go i don't

412
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,800
 know yet john and then you say are we gonna podcast this time next week and i say i don't know yet john

413
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:16,480
 um we do the same time so if listeners can can be aware of this at 6 p.m on sundays i have a

414
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,520
 reminder that says check calendar and so if you ever schedule anything for me during a week you

415
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,280
 will receive a message from me at roughly 6 to 8 p.m on a sunday saying we still on because um i

416
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,880
 have a reminder that tells me to do that and so i do it because i'm that person i i am not as good

417
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,360
 with reminders and streaks and things of that kind as john but i have done my fair share of

418
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:46,160
 annoying prick type things like i too am exercising every day um mostly in my house mostly using

419
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:53,920
 um a VR headset and i have a very long list of exciting VR fitness games now i'm i wouldn't say

420
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,280
 i've tried all of them but i have tried an enormous number of them and i am getting better at drawing

421
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,160
 i think i realized that at the point where i was like i am going to paint vegetables every week that

422
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:13,440
 my sana my grip on sanity might not be as good as it could be like it's the things i'm choosing to

423
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,520
 do like like the other day i wrote a little nature notes post about how caroline and i had seen a tree

424
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:26,800
 with mistletoe and um and and and a little bit about how mistletoe works which is very interesting

425
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,160
 you see we have a conception of what our self is like we have a sense of self and we believe

426
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,160
 that we carry on being the same person from day to day but i can kind of look at

427
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:45,600
 allison a year ago or a bit more in a year ago and if you've said to me well in a year's time

428
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,920
 nothing will be much worse about your life despite the fact that we will be in the middle of an

429
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,680
 apocalypse but you will be interested in the mechanism by which mistletoe attract attaches

430
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,840
 to its host tree i'll be like you know you're a crack dude and that's it so i feel like i

431
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:08,640
 i feel like philosophically i may have changed personality very directly in in ways that unless

432
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,440
 it's not necessarily good but yeah i can draw much better than i could a year ago no and i think i

433
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,960
 think like to justify my annoying prickness these are all things that i've been intending to do

434
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,840
 and have never got round two and i was like well if i don't do them now i'm never gonna and so there

435
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:29,600
 was a kind of sense of um vague malaise and guilt that kind of nagged me into it um but it is also

436
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,080
 it's just good to have my anxiety i have always found it easier to deal with my anxiety when i

437
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,280
 keep myself busy and so um yeah well i mean i think learning to draw was definitely the

438
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,840
 category of things i was hoping to get around to but my drawing is much better than it was

439
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:50,080
 the i mean it's just much better than it was a year ago and the fitness stuff is good um i i'd

440
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,720
 love to say i've lost a lot of weight but i haven't um roughly the same weight that i was at the start

441
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,200
 but liz you have a disadvantage here in that you've been keeping sane in the apocalypse by living

442
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,480
 in a place that is not really all that apocalyptic yeah i do have a strong advantage in that the it

443
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,480
 turns out the apocalypse is not evenly distributed i was looking at uh it's a john bern murdock the

444
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,880
 financial times journalist who does lots of nice data visualizations have it has like a visualization

445
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,800
 of the whole pandemic with you know chunks for different parts of the world and basically it is

446
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,720
 exactly the inversion of what i thought we were going to see a year ago in that all the majority

447
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,200
 of cases have been in lino north america and then europe and then south american then you have these

448
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,960
 little tiny bits for comparatively for you know africa and and east and south east asia um and if

449
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,760
 you'd ask me a year ago i'm pretty sure that is exactly the opposite of who i thought would be most

450
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,520
 prepared to uh whether a pandemic so that's quite interesting um but yeah it turns out i have been

451
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,760
 doing okay by living in a place which is still having a pandemic but just controlling it very

452
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,080
 well and for the most part with a few exceptions life has continued pretty much as normal as long

453
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,080
 as you never want to leave the country uh the the main problem is that at some point i would

454
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:10,960
 like leave the country uh and the the longer i'm here the the more i recognize that um you know

455
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,720
 there are people i haven't seen for a long long time and at some point i think vaccination status is

456
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,560
 going to be a big deal in whether people can move around freely and um i am not likely to be vaccinated

457
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,200
 anytime soon so that's kind of my background is the apocalypse coming but otherwise yeah i

458
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,520
 haven't really had to take on any special mechanisms for staying staying in the apocalypse because we

459
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,040
 haven't really had one because if if i was still able to go outside and see my friends i would have

460
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,320
 a lot less time in the evenings for all of the things i've described and i would probably be

461
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:51,840
 in general happier um so i think i miss my friends a great deal and whenever i see photographs of

462
00:42:51,840 --> 00:43:00,960
 san francisco i tear up so like i'm clearly not thriving in every dimension um like i miss my

463
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,600
 friends and i miss i miss i miss going to san francisco and like seeing friends there and i miss restaurants

464
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:15,280
 and i miss sport yeah and i'm hopeful that will come back at some point but um but if i spend enough

465
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,600
 time learning spanish and learning programming every day i don't think about it and then i don't get

466
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:28,160
 sad this is a coping mechanism known as avoidance but for something that's essentially temporary um

467
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,640
 it's actually okay to develop coping mechanisms that involve not thinking about the temporary

468
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,280
 state of the first well now and this is the thing right i i can't do much to control this other

469
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,200
 than staying in my house i'm wearing a mask when i have to go outside both of which i'm doing and

470
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,760
 so spending too much time being sad about the fact that there are things that i don't like about how

471
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,240
 my life is at the moment doesn't seem like a good use of my energy um so yeah i think i'm not

472
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,760
 i'm not worried the way i'm coping i'm aware that i have got this coping mechanism which is basically

473
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,000
 stavie'sy enough that you don't think about what's happening um so you know i'm just sort of like

474
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,680
 and a meta level conscious that that is a thing at the moment i've also been doing a podcast with

475
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,440
 two lovely people oh yeah so there is all the stuff like we we did a podcast and we ran a

476
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,400
 science fiction convention and stuff like that and we forgot we'd run the science fiction convention

477
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,320
 when we did a review of our fanak in 2020 which was very funny um so when you were sort of talking

478
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:31,200
 about journaling i've been journaling a lot um sorry Claire um because because glares go to

479
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,880
 to read my journals when i'm dead and go what on earth was this about is that a threat

480
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,360
 is that i don't know how to pass that it's a close gonna read all your journals after your

481
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,240
 dead Claire may read all my journals before then Claire wants to do an anthology of my fan writing

482
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,240
 and i'm like but my fan writing is largely in co-it bits and pieces because i should do a fancy

483
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,240
 scene um anyway um that that brings some of the incur bits and pieces but i've been doing a lot

484
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,240
 of journaling and i've been doing a lot of self-reflecting and again these are things like i

485
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,040
 feel like i may be although i go well i'm exactly the same person i was a year ago i'm clearly not

486
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,840
 the same person i was a year ago because the person i was a year ago was not very self-reflective so

487
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,760
 it's kind of weird and then having said oh yes i've been doing lots of this stuff it happens that

488
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,120
 for the last week i haven't for the last week i've been taking a particular video game and going

489
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,640
 oh it's got this set of incredibly hard achievements maybe i could get all of them which is i know

490
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,920
 in a moment of self-reflection perhaps not the best use of my time um but something's going on

491
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,440
 there and i think it may have something to do with the anniversary of this and thinking oh yes

492
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,760
 all of this is a year since we started um reordering our life so there will be an apocalypse for those

493
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,640
 of us who did i i think it's also like john says about about copy mechanisms like there's probably

494
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,840
 part of your brain that's gone well i'm gonna do all this stuff and things bad but it's all temporary

495
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:03,280
 and then you're like oh it's a year doesn't seem very temporary new so the other thing i found is

496
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,000
 that so for instance my parents didn't open their christmas presents because they were like we'll

497
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,240
 save the freestyle and we can have family christmas and something i have been doing in the apocalypse

498
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,760
 is that i've not just been in a holding pattern waiting for my life to restart i've been making

499
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,040
 the most of what i can do in the apocalypse i think a lot of the people i've been talking to

500
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:31,360
 seem to be coping better have been trying to make the most of it instead of kind of waiting for it

501
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,520
 to stop and so i did i should eventually say to my parents like you should open your christmas

502
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,520
 presents like like you know i mean i'm hopeful i get to see you but you can't just you can't take

503
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,080
 every joyful experience out of your life until the world's fixed and then have them all at once that

504
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:52,800
 that doesn't seem like a good tack i appreciate that's difficult because i am um privileged in

505
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,440
 that i have had the energy to follow that advice and i appreciate there will be people for whom

506
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,640
 that is not true and they don't have the spoons or the batteries um to kind of try and make try

507
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:09,280
 and make the best of the situation because it is a hugely stressful and um draining situation to be

508
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,080
 in um so i know that there will be some people listening who are like well yeah but i didn't have

509
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:20,480
 the the the the batteries and i completely sympathize um i don't have any useful advice well

510
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:27,120
 all once again refer people to the cgp grave video spaceship u in which he talks about what to do

511
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:34,800
 if you have no batteries and where to start so that is us staying sane in the apocalypse next week

512
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:41,120
 we will be uh reading out the poems we have received for our anthology for the anniversary of the

513
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,400
 otterthorpe podcast and we will be discussing all of the exciting news that has come out of

514
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,600
 easter con about what it is they're doing and how and we will be talking about our plants for easter

515
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,360
 con and what we're going to do which we'll know about because we will know a lot more about how

516
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:00,800
 easter con is going to work by then yeah and that is a good thing to look forward to and liz where

517
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,080
 are you going that means you can't record next sunday is it exciting i might go to the beach

518
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,680
 tell us about the beach liz what is it like is it outside is there air

519
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:22,640
 is outside it is a few a few hours uh from bankok hey that's good that was the 26th episode of the

520
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,880
 oxithorpe podcast and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

521
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:44,800
 that was an entire year of podcasting

522
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:56,640
 i'm not going to a particularly no speech because i'm going to all witches close and also there are

523
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,600
 quite a few places so in this like we're in a the like british tears except they're done by

524
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:08,320
 collars instead and so i'm currently in an orange zone and i'm going to travel to yellow but some

525
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,720
 of them won't let people travel from orange zones yet without 14 days of quarantine are these

526
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,800
 like tears they are very like tears except that they're color coded and so there are five of them

527
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,520
 and also but also provinces can have their own adventure restrictions anyway the point is that

528
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,800
 i can't travel everywhere because not everywhere wants to accept visitors from uh orange-tiered

529
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,520
 places when they are green or yellow-tiered places but what orange tier means is i mean i think we've

530
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:40,000
 had like a handful of cases on some days in the past two weeks right so by orange tier we mean

531
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,280
 that we are coming down from what the british would consider to be extremely well controlled to

532
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,840
 almost zero so it's only context really when you when when allison said oh are there five

533
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,240
 five levels because they're color coded does that imply allison only thinks there are five colors

534
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,520
 because there are more than five colors i was thinking it was like the mousy mousy of

535
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,480
 pandemic control so instead of having a die you would have like a die with colors on

536
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,200
 a for for people who can't manage numbers oh she she's off again making cultural references i don't

537
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,720
 get Liz yeah don't get this one either massy massy i mean he's calling us off a gamer he must

538
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,200
 have played massy massy must i is that a game that cats play much played i mean it's not a game

539
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:33,760
 that virtualizes well but it is much played amongst um actual people at like games conventions

540
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,400
 and things in corners because you play it with an anvil which the originals does not contain an

541
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:46,160
 anvil why do you take a heavy weight so when you when you slam down the cup to catch the mice also

542
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:57,040
 what are you talking about i found a link on game.co.uk to a game called mousy mousy it's got a solo cup

543
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,160
 and an illustration of two mice but it doesn't have any pictures of it in play so i can't look

544
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,680
 right all i'm saying is you need to put a link in the show notes okay so okay so after the apocalypse

545
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,520
 i will play mousy mousy with you oh hello lison being proposition again it's a sound vaguely threatening

546
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:23,200
 it's a game for people who have not yet learned to count so therefore games with dice where you have

547
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:30,400
 to do something that involves the numbers on a dice are too hard for them so so you you use a die

548
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:37,120
 with um with colors on it instead this is probably off topic um the theme music for this episode was
