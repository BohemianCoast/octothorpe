1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 Sorry, I just tried to read and talk the same time.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,800
 It went completely wrong.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:21,360
 Hello, everyone, and welcome to the very 54th episode of the Oct.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,560
 Podcast, which is coming to you on the 31st of March 2022.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,840
 I'm John Coxson.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,360
 I'm Alison Scott.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,680
 And I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,920
 We have a bumper roster of letters of comment this week on account of how I had COVID last week.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
 And so we only gave you a measly 14 minutes of entertainment.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
 And thank you to everyone who asked if John was better.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,600
 John, are you better?

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
 I appear to be.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,320
 You don't sound like you've gargled a load of gravel.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:59,360
 I have a headache and a sore throat, but I think the headache and sore throat are mostly because of the dust this time and not because of the COVID.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,920
 Because I think getting reinfected this quickly would be spectacularly unlikely.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,640
 Yeah, I had a headache and a dribbly nose and I did an LFT and it was negative.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,720
 And I said a headache and dribbly nose and I didn't have to.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,280
 It was negative.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,800
 And then I went, oh, of course, and took my anti-estamines.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,280
 So yeah, that's a sort of thing.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,840
 There's a lot of dust in my house now listeners.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,960
 This is the experience I have this week and I will probably take an LFT in the middle of recording this podcast, but they will be negative.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,880
 So I'm pretty sure I don't have COVID.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,720
 You're going to take one mid podcast, although it's positive you're going to stop.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,120
 Are you doing an actual play of an LFT?

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,600
 Is this like a experiment to see whether LFTs are in fact eligible for the best interactive experience Hugo?

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,480
 That bomb you just heard was Alison putting her foot down listeners.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,440
 It wasn't, but I'll remember this.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,480
 I actually do lateral flow tests in the middle of octa-thord episodes quite often because

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,560
 it's finding a time when I can guarantee that I haven't eaten or haven't drunk any coffee in the last half hour.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,960
 So because there is no coffee, so in half an hour's time, I would not have had any coffee for half an hour and and 10.

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,160
 Brilliant.

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,920
 That is a good plan, actually.

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,160
 And we also got a lot of comments on Sue Asen's fantastic artwork.

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,320
 Thank you very much to Sue.

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,080
 Yeah, we have more fantastic artwork from guest artists in the pipeline.

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
 We are very pleased about that.

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,600
 Duncan McGregor is very worried what I'm going to do with the picture of him.

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,120
 And hopefully you'll see that in this episode's artwork as long as I get my finger out.

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
 Excellent.

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:45,040
 So we had a letter of comment from one Christopher J Garcia.

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,120
 And he notes that he can if pressed, it quates everything to genre awards, especially food.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,360
 And I'd like you to express Korean barbecue in the context of genre awards, please Chris.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:05,280
 He is in favor of bids having a big website that contains everything you could possibly want to know about the bid, but especially costs.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,760
 And my comment on that would be as somebody who's currently working on a bid.

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:19,520
 Sometimes the information that you would love to put on the website isn't entirely there yet when you're working on a bid and you probably don't want people to know that.

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:27,440
 So the website said to be a collection of the stuff that we know and can talk about and are not still arguing about.

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
 And I think that's fine too.

49
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,840
 So you're saying it's better for your website to be missing.

50
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,960
 Basically, it's better for your website to be extremely minimalist because otherwise what's not on your website might give away where your committee is still arguing.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,880
 I don't think so because I don't think people spot it that well, but I think it is better to be

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,280
 have limited information on the website than have the website be wrong.

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
 Yes, I would agree with that.

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,720
 I think that's fair.

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,240
 But I think sometimes when websites don't have everything you might possibly want, that's why it's because behind the scenes everything you might possibly want is not yet settled.

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,720
 Yeah, I didn't say the bid sessions, you know, in a bid session, what I want to hear is information which is correct from the bids.

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
 I feel that one should go without saying.

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,200
 You'd be amazed though.

59
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:18,080
 I think people who have not run bids may not know how much is left, not till the last minute.

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:30,960
 But like, there's a lot that you don't know until you know and like you have to bear in mind that the cost curve for a convention, your actual budget and your projected budget can be massively divergent numbers.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,040
 And you don't really understand sometimes you don't understand how much money you've got to play with until three weeks before the con.

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,080
 And so you do there are certain things you're like, we really want to be able to do this.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,320
 And if we get enough members, we'll definitely be able to do it.

64
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,360
 But we haven't got enough members yet, so we can't announce it yet.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,960
 And then what sometimes happens, which is a lovely problem to have, is that you get way more members than you're expecting.

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,240
 And then suddenly you've got to work out things to spend money on right at the last minute where you hadn't planned to at all.

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:06,000
 And so like I do, I appreciate, because this point, but I also appreciate Alison's point that like these things are highly variable, even like right up to the convention.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
 It can be very difficult to know what's actually going to happen.

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:17,120
 And the cost curve for East Cons in particular is while the out of whack at the moment, nobody really knows what it is anymore.

70
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
 It used to be pretty reliable. And now it's not at all.

71
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,800
 Is that to do with Covid or was that happening before Covid, Alison?

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:36,480
 I think it is a combination of Covid and the fact that London East Cons are not like non-London East Cons is the two things that primarily drive that.

73
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:46,080
 So essentially in terms of the will you get a massive bunch of members in the last month, the answer seems to be whether you either will or you won't.

74
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,840
 Which is not great.

75
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:57,200
 But it is factually correct, so I'm for it.

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,960
 A website is a lasting thing that people can point to and pillory you if you fail to live up to the promises on it.

77
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,440
 So I think in that case we could describe a website as an immutable artifact.

78
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,680
 We could certainly describe it as the opposite of a political manifesto.

79
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
 Oh, satire.

80
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,760
 Was that getting a bit political? We can segue from that, but not yet.

81
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,720
 Chris also says that because I am a novel, he is going to guess who I am written by.

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,640
 And his guess is Stephen Baxter, which is awkward because Hispania hates novels written by Stephen Baxter.

83
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,840
 So I really hope I'm not because that would be interesting for our marriage.

84
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,520
 So try again, Chris, please.

85
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
 Other listeners may also guess.

86
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,320
 Someone called and let me make sure I'm pronouncing their name right.

87
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,640
 Liz Batty sent us a lock on our last episode with a picture of a cat.

88
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,320
 So if you'd like to see an adorable cat, please go and look at the comments on the Facebook post for that episode.

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,840
 It is ginger. Lovely.

90
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,760
 Did you have a nice holiday Liz?

91
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,200
 I did. It was also very noisy cat, but would not come any closer than it is depicted in the photograph.

92
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:10,800
 And in our last episode, Johnny Badly heard John talking about Netrunner in his pick

93
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,120
 and is going to send John all his old Netrunner stuff.

94
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,920
 So I'd just like to let people know that I collect vintage emeralds.

95
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,560
 And if anyone would like to send me some, they'd be very, I'd be very grateful for those.

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,680
 Big ones better. Thank you.

97
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,160
 So listeners, Alison has told that joke four times and it was only in that most recent telling that I actually got it.

98
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,600
 So, you know, sometimes repetition is the secret to comedy.

99
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,400
 Really?

100
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,880
 Yeah. I just, yeah, no. Yeah. I'm quite dense sometimes.

101
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
 It's why I like rereading the Hitchhiker's Guide.

102
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,280
 There are always jokes in there that I didn't get on the first 46 read throughs.

103
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,840
 Well, I mean, you do want to keep telling jokes until they land.

104
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,840
 I mean, I haven't checked if Liz got it yet, but some people got it on the Facebook group, so it can't be impossible.

105
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,680
 We also had a message from Johnny about discos in COVID times.

106
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,320
 And whether or not we thought there'd be discos at conventions during COVID.

107
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,200
 And whether or not it would be fun to dance in a face mask.

108
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,080
 Having caught trains in a face mask and gotten unpleasant these way,

109
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,280
 I can't imagine dancing in a face mask is going to be anything like fun.

110
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,240
 But I might be wrong.

111
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,040
 I don't know how sweaty dancers like to get.

112
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,680
 I'm not judging, but I don't know.

113
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,880
 I don't know what the plans for the disco are at East con.

114
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,360
 East con committee, if you're listening right in.

115
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,040
 I do some with a face mask. It's all right.

116
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,640
 Interesting.

117
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,480
 So maybe the secret is that it's just fine, Johnny, and we just don't need to embrace the sweat.

118
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,640
 I mean, I'm going to be, if I'm dancing for an hour, then like, I'm going to be sweaty anyway.

119
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,200
 And so the mask doesn't seem to significantly add to that.

120
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,160
 I would say more impressive is that like the instructor who is more high energy than I am

121
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,360
 and also shouting is wearing a mask throughout.

122
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,320
 I think it's pretty impressive.

123
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,440
 We may have digressed a bit far, but yeah, I mean, I saw a mask to do exercise and it's okay.

124
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
 But a disco at a convention isn't exactly doing exercise, is it?

125
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
 It depends how you dance.

126
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
 It depends how much you're going at it to mean.

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
 Yeah.

128
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,920
 Can't be.

129
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,000
 Yeah, I remember my sweatiest moment at Dublin 2019.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,880
 It wasn't my sweat.

131
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,880
 I stood outside the Glasgow 2024 Kaylee briefly and waited as the

132
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,800
 meyasma floated over me from that room.

133
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,560
 So they were having a lot of fun and they were getting very sweaty.

134
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,600
 Pre-COVID.

135
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,480
 Okay, Lee is a very good way of getting very sweaty.

136
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,920
 Yeah.

137
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,800
 Listener Laurie from the podcast Hugo Girl mentioned that she has now read six

138
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,200
 weeks by Malefity and reliked it and is going to try to convince her co-host to

139
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,280
 add it to the schedule eventually.

140
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,280
 So I look forward to that happening because that sounds ace.

141
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,800
 And Laurie also told us that like me, she listens to her own podcast from time to time.

142
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,560
 So if you do a podcast and you like to listen back to it, let us know.

143
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,320
 Because I kind of think it's a good sign, but it might be that we're just very self-indulgent

144
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,760
 or I'm very self-indulgent.

145
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,640
 Um, why not both?

146
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,240
 We have a live follow-up from inside my house, which is that my wife says there was a dance

147
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
 at Clockwork Alchemy, which is a steampunk convention in the Bay Area,

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
 where the dance is all the war masks and I will link to...

149
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,840
 Well, if it's public, I will link to a Facebook post in the show notes listeners,

150
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,400
 although that was more couples dancing.

151
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,280
 My steampunk friends say that the steampunk community has embraced masks in a big way,

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,240
 which shouldn't surprise anyone really.

153
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,800
 I saw at Gallifrey 1 several of the cosplays worked masks into the costumes.

154
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,600
 So if you're doing like an alien cosplay, you had like a mask that was like the alien's face

155
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,040
 and some of those were really, really cool.

156
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,760
 [Music]

157
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,840
 So since we last recorded, there has been some more discussion of the Chengdu World Con.

158
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,920
 There has been a letter asking the World Con community to revoke the site selection of Chengdu

159
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
 in 2023.

160
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,840
 As a reaction to it threats to Taiwan about the Ukraine invasion and also the

161
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,080
 weaker genocide, as we discussed previously on this podcast.

162
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,440
 And I think it's a very well-meaning effort, but it is more, I think, drawing attention to the Chengdu

163
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,840
 World Conbid than actually having much hope that it will be revoked as a site,

164
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,360
 because there isn't really any mechanism for that to happen.

165
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,640
 But I think it is very nice to kind of raise awareness of it and also the letter does lay out

166
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,960
 in very clear and concrete terms the reasons why they feel human rights have been violated

167
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,080
 and the site selection should be revoked.

168
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,000
 So we're linked to that in the show notes.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,680
 The second issue that's also come up is that the guest of honor Sergei Lukianenko

170
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,880
 has previously made extremely pro-Russian anti-Ukraine posts on his live journal.

171
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,280
 And after the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, he has also now signed an open letter

172
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,200
 supporting the invasion of Ukraine and making other favorable comments about it.

173
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,080
 So there's been a lot of discussion and contact with Chengdu and pressure on them,

174
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,240
 I think, to try and disinvite him as a guest of honor due to these views.

175
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,600
 As yet, I don't think we've heard anything from Chengdu about Lukianenko or about the open letter.

176
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,120
 But what I will say is, you know, these views cannot have come as a surprise to them.

177
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,440
 You know, the immediate context of the invasion of Ukraine, yes, definitely has,

178
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,160
 but it's not like these views were owned and owned before they invited him.

179
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,560
 This is something that they're going to have to deal with and it shouldn't have come as a surprise

180
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,920
 to them. But so far, they've remained silent on it.

181
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,640
 Yeah, I think this is a very good example of how something that I think we discussed

182
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,360
 previous to the events of recent times in Europe with a kind of, you know, this is clearly

183
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,080
 unacceptable, then became a lot less theoretical very quickly.

184
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,600
 I think this is a lesson for conventions who are like, oh, but, you know,

185
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,520
 X has this objectionable thing, but it probably won't end up being a problem.

186
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:23,120
 And then you look at Discon with Tony Vyskov and you look at Chengdu with this chap and you think,

187
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,560
 oh, no, sometimes these things that you think, oh, we could probably get away with it,

188
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,680
 turns out they become giant pains in the arse very quickly.

189
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,800
 Yeah, I was also going to say it's one of the things we were discussing about on previous episodes

190
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,000
 about, you know, rehabilitation, whether someone's acts in the past should always,

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,240
 you know, be automatically, oh, you should take those into account.

192
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,040
 And in this case, they may have thought, well, he's made comments in the past,

193
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,680
 but they were quite a long time ago. Maybe he's not said anything since then, you know,

194
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,040
 maybe they could have discussed it with him, what would happen in the future,

195
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,000
 but I presume they did not. And now it has become a much more, you know, recent and pressing problem.

196
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,560
 And props to Marcin, who was the first person around me who said, oh, no, this guy is a badan,

197
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,480
 you know, Chengdu should not have invited him. It's a terrible idea. And he was right.

198
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,360
 Yeah, and it was the Polish Eastern European fans who were very much aware of this before I was.

199
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,200
 It was not something I was aware of before they raised it after the site section vote.

200
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,920
 There has been, so it's worth noting that the guest of honour having objection to all opinions

201
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,840
 is not the focus of the open letter. So the two are happening in close proximity to one another,

202
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,920
 but are not like necessarily related. Oh, there are letters on Luke and Yanko as well.

203
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:47,760
 So so people have been writing. This sort of thing is why I think that bringing WorldCon to

204
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,800
 countries that have not had WorldCon before is great. I think that I did a good thing. I think that

205
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,160
 I did not support China as a WorldCon because I had real concerns about various problems with

206
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,800
 their human rights record. And that was before they announced their guest of honour, who kind of

207
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 didn't make me think that those concerns were things that were being talked about in the Chengdu

208
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,240
 organisation very freely. Because I think if a convention had had an idea that there was concerns

209
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,840
 about their human right record, they might have invited a different guest of honour who wouldn't

210
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:25,680
 add fuel to that fire. I think that what this shows is there probably does need to be some mechanism

211
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:33,040
 for a bid to need to fill certain human rights criteria before being allowed to be voted. Because

212
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,000
 if we can't deselect a bid, it means it's on us to make sure that bids that are selected are appropriate.

213
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,960
 And I think that if the end of not doing that is that WorldCon's name gets dragged through the

214
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:54,000
 mud by association, that will be a problem for WorldCon going forward. And so I think that this is all

215
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 a lot of these very academic discussions that we were having around Saudi Arabia when they were

216
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,720
 bidding are suddenly becoming a lot less academic. And I do think we need to be thinking quite seriously

217
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,480
 about where we put these lines in the sand and whether or not there needs to be some sort of

218
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,440
 record mechanism or something like that. But I don't know how any of that would work. And it's a very

219
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,920
 difficult conversation. I think it's very tempting to go what we need is some, you know, as part of

220
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,200
 filing, they need to satisfy these human rights criteria. I think there is a risk that

221
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,200
 many bids would not be able to do that in many countries, including many countries that

222
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,680
 we are generally comfortable with and it's hard, it would be very hard to draw some lines there.

223
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,640
 I also think this might all be a very theoretical argument because I think the world might be

224
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,120
 becoming a very complex place in which travelling freely all the way around the world to meet fans

225
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,040
 from all over the world becomes very, very difficult over the next few years. That was a bit depressing.

226
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:03,120
 I would say I have seen two concrete suggestions for this. One was using an

227
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,360
 it's called the Democracy Index, which comes from the people who published The Economist,

228
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,720
 which basically gives every country a ranking as to whether there are full or flawed democracy,

229
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,400
 a hybrid regime or an authoritarian regime. And the suggestion was that you should only have

230
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,120
 World Cons in regions which are democracies. And there's also an index which basically ranks all

231
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:34,320
 countries as either free or not free, which is I think the Freedom House, Freedom in the World

232
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,360
 Index. So there seem to be two concrete suggestions I've seen just because the problem of

233
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,080
 how to measure this is very difficult. I would say that both of them sure are coming at this

234
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,240
 from a Western perspective. I think they're done by the people who do The Economist and by

235
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,720
 US NGO. So they are coming from a certain perspective. And also there's conflicts between them.

236
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,280
 There are countries which are ranked as democracies but not free for other reasons. And it also

237
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,560
 includes countries that might be controversial but are still democracies under the Democracy

238
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,600
 Index. But those are the concrete suggestions I have seen. And I suspect we're going to see

239
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,320
 more discussion of this. And I guess the other thing to say is that the Chengdu Wilcon has

240
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,600
 obviously a guest shiqin lu, which makes a ton of sense because he's probably the most prominent

241
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:36,080
 Chinese language author outside of China. But he also went asked about his political views on the

242
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,480
 one child policy and the re-education camps has been kind of loosely supportive of them. So I

243
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,280
 think that's another thing that Chengdu are going to need to be aware of. For instance,

244
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,120
 like Netflix are adapting some of his works and I think I've had to distance themselves

245
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,680
 from Lou's views. So when I had Sinopticon as one of my picks, one of the things in that is

246
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,960
 it's clear that loads of stuff is getting edited in translation because it would not

247
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,400
 the things that Chinese SF authors write often do not land well with Western audiences

248
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,960
 on all sorts of different fronts. And that certainly happened with Shikson and Lou.

249
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:21,280
 So that economist post ranks the US as only just above a, I might be getting the colour

250
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,840
 scale slightly wrong, but it doesn't rank it as a full democracy. So I do think that's like

251
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:34,640
 a reasonable take. I mean, but it does rank China as orange and orange listeners is

252
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,520
 not just not just good orange, like angry, actually no, not even orange, more in maroon colour.

253
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,200
 And that is bad. I mean, if you've got red, green colour blindness, the world is just shades of

254
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,960
 gray. Full democracy, but not the best. Second rank of full democracy. Yeah, better than Spain,

255
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,840
 which probably fair. Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany, Iceland, all complete full democracies,

256
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,440
 and Canada. Israel is a flawed democracy by these standards, but I'm still not sure that an Israel

257
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,440
 worldcom would be, you know, if that's our ranking, are people going to be happy with that?

258
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,280
 I think it's probably better to have some fixed system that is outside of Wussfuss control,

259
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,680
 which occasionally yields edge cases I disagree with than it is to try and do it.

260
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,920
 Do you see what I mean? Like, at least then it's not, it's not us being wrong. And it's like, no,

261
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,600
 we've, we've yoked our star to this carriage, and we're just doing what they say. And sometimes

262
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,240
 that might be an edge case that's annoying. But like, certainly looking at this, it reinforces a

263
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,000
 lot of my preconceptions about where I would have said to the best democracies in the world are

264
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,720
 New Zealand, Scandinavia. I mean, you know, it's not whatever you pick isn't going to be perfect,

265
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,360
 but like, I do think that map, but both of these maps, I think you could make an argument

266
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,000
 are like relatively sensible, kind of first steps. And it's not the be all and end all here. It is,

267
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,040
 you know, a first pass. I mean, you can, we're still going to have votes and people are still

268
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,560
 going to choose, and this is still going to be part of how they choose where they would like to see

269
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,240
 a worldcom. But it basically would eliminate some sites from being eligible to bid right from the

270
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:19,040
 get-go. I don't see this ratifying in China, guys. Well, I mean, I think the, the ratification in

271
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,720
 China is going to be very interesting because of the way Chengdu have structured their memberships.

272
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,440
 Chengdu have given us the opportunity to send Liz back into the Wussfuss caves.

273
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,880
 To the back constitution, Liz, the Chengdu will come while remaining silent,

274
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,560
 other things have released their membership rates. In fact, they release their membership rates,

275
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,240
 and then they release their membership rates again with some more instructions because it's

276
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,440
 quite a confusing table. But essentially, the way they're structuring it is that you can purchase a

277
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,920
 Wussfuss membership, which is, I think what we would normally say is kind of a supporting membership.

278
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:06,640
 And this is automatic if you voted in the 2023 site selection, or you can pay $50 for the Wussfuss

279
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,600
 membership. So far, pretty standard. And then you can add an in-person admission, which is free

280
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:22,720
 if you voted in the 2023 site selection. And then there are rates between $30 and $70 for the in-person

281
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,160
 admission, or you can purchase online admission, which is between $2 and $10, depending if it's

282
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,160
 your first World Coronary student or various other things, which is actually a model that I think

283
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,080
 one of the recent constitutional amendments was moving towards where you have kind of a Wussfuss

284
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,280
 membership, and then you purchase the in-person admission to the Wilcom on top. But the, the

285
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,520
 difference that Chengdu are making is that you don't have to purchase that Wussfuss membership at all.

286
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,240
 You can just purchase the in-person admission and attend the convention, but you won't have the

287
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,760
 rights to vote in any site selection or Q-Go awards or presumably attend the business meeting on site.

288
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,480
 This is quite controversial. Well, in certain circles, it's quite controversial because of the

289
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,840
 way the Wussfuss Constitution is written. It says you can't do this. It says you cannot sell an

290
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,200
 attending membership without including Wussfuss rights. Except for, I think, day memberships and

291
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,680
 children are excluded. So, you can sell a Charles membership or a day membership without including

292
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:24,800
 voting rights, but otherwise Wussfuss membership is key. And I kind of understand why Chengdu don't

293
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,920
 want to, but I mean, I don't know why Chengdu don't want to, which is this, that there are other

294
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,800
 bits of the Constitution, which say, you know, the supporting membership rate is essentially set

295
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,800
 in advance by all the bids in agreement with the Committee of the Wilcom hosting the site selection,

296
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,400
 and they all have to kind of agree on the bidding fee, otherwise it defaults to basically the

297
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,800
 median of the past three. So, you're never going to manage to set a supporting membership rate,

298
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,600
 which is at the moment less than about $50. But the other bit of says that you may not

299
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,520
 sell a membership, which includes any Wussfuss voting rights for less than the cost of supporting

300
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,080
 membership mentioned in Article 4. So, they're not allowed to sell anything that includes Wussfuss

301
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,480
 voting rights for less than $50, which means they can't sell a full attending membership for less

302
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,720
 than $50. But obviously, they would like to do that because they would like to have some very cheap

303
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,520
 attending membership in order to attract people for whom the cost is prohibitive. And of course,

304
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,240
 we are talking about, I think, the first Wilcom being held in a lower middle-income country,

305
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,320
 where the idea of paying $120 for membership is prohibitive to many, many people. And so,

306
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,680
 they've opted to have this in-person admission, which ranges from $30 for a student to $70 for

307
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,200
 someone who's been to multiple Wilcoms, which doesn't include the Wussfuss voting rights,

308
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,680
 which gets around that bit, the Constitution. But it also falls foul of the bit about not

309
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,720
 having any selling any full attending memberships, which don't include Wussfuss voting rights.

310
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:57,280
 So, there's an interesting point here, which is that one of the decisions I saw about this on some

311
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:04,160
 group on Facebook here or there was someone pointing out that at the moment, if you buy a day

312
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,000
 pass to each day of the Wilcom, you don't get Wussfuss voting rights, which is in

313
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,440
 contravention of the Constitution. So, existing Wilcoms do already disobey these provisions because

314
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,240
 it is possible to just keep buying day passes and never become a Wussfuss voting member.

315
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,280
 And I think this is the thing, which is the Constitution is very specific because it says like,

316
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,040
 you can't sell a membership that allows attendance and full participation for the

317
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,240
 entire duration of the Convention and does not include Wussfuss voting rights.

318
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,480
 But if they say that these memberships don't entitle you to go to the Wussfuss business meeting,

319
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
 it doesn't include full attendance of the Convention and therefore it doesn't need to include Wussfuss

320
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,560
 voting rights, which is completely compliant with the Constitution and fine. So, all you need to do

321
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,000
 is ban these people from attending the business meeting and jobs are good. I do think that,

322
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,880
 in this case, the other problem is that the Constitution is written in a very US-centric way.

323
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,800
 Not just US-centric, but anglicpher-centric, I guess.

324
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,440
 Yeah, which is to assume that basically everyone attending the Wilcom can definitely afford $50

325
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,600
 right. And that is not going to be true if the Wilcom does start branching out to countries which

326
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,000
 do have lower levels of income. And like, I'm thinking also of places like India or Brazil or

327
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,480
 places like that, if they ever decide they want to vote and bid for a Wilcom, then this may be a

328
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,520
 problem. And we probably need to have a think about how to make sure that Wussfuss,

329
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,240
 that the intention that the Wilcom is made up of people who form Wussfuss,

330
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,440
 matches the reality of what if the Wilcom is held in a country where people don't have a lot of

331
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,280
 money and it would be useful to offer a membership to local people, which includes Wussfuss but is

332
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,640
 less than a supporting membership, because I think that would be good. And you could definitely

333
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,800
 modify the Constitution to allow that. So I think, I mean, I don't know, it might be that

334
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 Chengdu haven't spotted this loophole and are just hoping no one notices, but I can see a loophole

335
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,080
 in these two that means you can do this and it's fine. But yeah, I think there is a wealth privilege

336
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,160
 thing here which probably needs to be addressed. I think you've probably made my point which is

337
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:15,360
 that I'm kind of with Chengdu. I don't know how to do things like the first Wilcom memberships,

338
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,640
 that's probably still more than the supporting membership, aren't they? That's the issue,

339
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,200
 is that they want to have a very cheap membership for locals and I don't blame them. And I think

340
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,320
 they should be encouraged and we should find a way to make that happen. And the probable way to do

341
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,360
 this is for Wussfuss just to turn a blind eye, which is the sort of thing that Wussfuss loves to do,

342
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,120
 as you know. What if they don't turn a blind eye? What are they going to do? Where are the enforcement

343
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,440
 clauses in the Wussfuss Constitution that means anything can be done? There aren't any. So Chengdu

344
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
 can do what they like. They have the right to host the Wilcom, there's no way of taking that away

345
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,080
 from them and there's no enforcement mechanism in the Constitution. So you can do whatever.

346
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,160
 Like we have known this, I mean at least since New Zealand, which I would argue flagrantly,

347
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,280
 violated the Wussfuss Constitution even though Kevin Sandley disagrees with me,

348
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,640
 but we know that you can do whatever you like already. It's fine. But I will also say this is

349
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,320
 really interesting because one of the things that has been mooted is that the Hugo Awards would look

350
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,760
 very different this year because they'll be loads of Chinese voters. And if all the Chinese voters

351
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,360
 have bought super cheap memberships that don't give them Hugo voting, right? It's going to look

352
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,960
 basically the same as normal everyone. So yeah, is that good for the Hugo's? What do we think?

353
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,880
 Yeah, so I would say a couple of things. Yeah, one is that like I feel that, yeah, essentially

354
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,800
 the supporting membership price sort of has locked them in in a way that probably wasn't intended by

355
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,000
 the Wussfuss Constitution because it may be that they can run a Wilcom for a lot cheaper than we

356
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,840
 can run a Wilcom in the US or the UK or Ireland. I think they're just the sponsorship and membership

357
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,680
 and income. It looks very different. I mean, the second argument you can make is that

358
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,680
 it's not just holding them in places where the income is lower. It's also, could we possibly

359
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,040
 want to hold one in the US or the UK where we ran it with a much lower membership fee and

360
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,560
 use a different model where we either made it much cheaper or tried to expand to many more people.

361
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:14,160
 Like it also blocks that kind of thing. Yeah, in terms of the Hugo's, I actually think I probably

362
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,200
 will have more to say on Chinese influence on the Hugo nominations once we have the Hugo

363
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,840
 nominations in a couple of weeks. That's true. Yeah, hopefully we'll have them by Easter.

364
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,160
 That's actually a good point. That's a good point because we know that everyone who

365
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,560
 voted for Chengdu did have a supporting membership to discount. So we'll be eligible to nominate.

366
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,960
 Sorry, that was the point I was going to make, which is that 2000 Chinese voters already have

367
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,640
 a full attending membership of Chengdu and convert to the Hugo's and that is plenty.

368
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,440
 Oh, yes. So if you voted at the discount three-type selection for either bid, you are an attending

369
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,240
 member of Chengdu, which is kind of magic. A full wuss for attending membership voting rights for

370
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,360
 literally your support, your site selection fee. So that was a, in my view, quite a good deal.

371
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,640
 Not that I think the chances of my being at Chengdu, at the Chengdu work on are infinitesimal for

372
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,240
 multiple reasons, but it's still pretty exciting. And the virtual membership for people who hadn't

373
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,760
 noticed is $2 and I really like that. I think that will increase participation, usually, not just in

374
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,200
 China. Yeah, I very much like that. What they've been able to do essentially is to reward all the

375
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,440
 people who, reward all the people who supported them by paying $50 to vote in a process that might

376
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,760
 have seen them get a supporting membership in Winnie-Pager Convention they can never realistically go to.

377
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,040
 And so they reward them by saying, well, thank you for that. You can now come to the World

378
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,800
Com and we don't need any extra from you. And then there will also be the, you know, there's probably

379
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,440
 many people in like the US and the UK who voted for Winnie-Pag and now have full attending membership

380
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,160
 in a Worldcon in China. They probably won't be able to go to or will choose not to go to.

381
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,200
 So it does work both ways. Yeah, it means that the, I think the potential for that being, you know,

382
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,200
 not just the however many Chinese members who have full attending wisface memberships, but however

383
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,120
 many others they might gain, I would imagine that it will now be a lot lower because why pay,

384
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,400
 you know, $100 when you could pay $50 if what you really want to do is go to the convention.

385
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:22,480
 And so it is still going to be a very interesting set of nominees and voting for Chengdu and also

386
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,600
 the business meeting there is going to be interesting. And that's another thing because we were talking

387
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,680
 about the other thing is that a lot of things that will come up for ratification in Chengdu may be

388
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:40,480
 again predominantly people who voted in site selection and the US/other Anglo-fans because,

389
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,360
 you know, if a lot of the Chinese members have not bought wisface right. Presumably there won't be

390
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,560
 in the business meeting and therefore, yeah, the ratification would be interesting.

391
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,800
 Chances of the business meeting having sorted out remote participation by next Worldcon?

392
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,760
 Very low, I would say.

393
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,960
 Zero. Yeah. Because they're going to require that it's a thing, they're going to require an

394
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,880
 amendment to the Constitution despite the fact that obviously attending the member, you could

395
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,480
 have told them a commensurate virtually and therefore you should be able to vote virtually, but there we go.

396
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,000
 I would, I may have argued this before, but I think the wisface constitution is not,

397
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,520
 it's worded in a way that means that if you have the Worldcon in a place that you're attending it,

398
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,240
 you should be able to go to the business meeting and if you're attending the Worldcon virtually,

399
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,120
 that should mean you get to go to the business meeting virtually and the fact that you can't,

400
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,240
 I think, is a flagrant breach of the Constitution, but see also lack of any coherent enforcement

401
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
 mechanism. I agree.

402
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:42,240
 Right, so shall we talk about the FAN Awards?

403
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,360
 Why not? Yes, we should talk about the FAN Awards. Congratulations to everyone who won and congratulate

404
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,400
 and thank you very much to the two people who voted for us, one is a Gen Zine and one is a

405
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:01,040
 perzine, both of whose votes were thrown out because the administrator as predicted concluded that we

406
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:08,240
 are not a FAN Zine for the purpose of the FAN Awards. Because we're not published listeners.

407
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,360
 For no reason I can tell because we do keep looking at their definition going.

408
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,320
 Yeah, yeah. So I think our problem is that we satisfy the definition but we do not quite like a

409
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,880
 duck. Yes, when we, when I push the publish podcast button in our podcast software, that is not

410
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,320
 publishing. It is different for some reason that I haven't worked out. And it's definitely not just

411
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,800
 because they forgot to put the word written in their definition of a FAN Zine. It could just be

412
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,840
 written but then I thought but if I did a FAN Zine that was all art and contained no words,

413
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,840
 would that count? Oh, and I submit that it would. I mean, I submit that's a graphic novel now,

414
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,640
 Alison. No, but it was good. Good people won in various categories. Good things got voted for,

415
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,560
 which is nice. There were 66 voters this year and Alison has an observation.

416
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:05,280
 Yeah, so quite a lot of these voters think that the hugos are a bad thing and terrible and don't

417
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,920
 reward the right sorts of things. And I am going to say that if you 66 people get on and vote in

418
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,600
 the hugos, those of you who have Wilcon memberships, you probably would get some of the things you

419
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,160
 like onto the ballot. Because a lot of things that you like just kind of dribble under the

420
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:25,200
 ballot in the FAN categories and yeah, vote. I mean, it's a bit, you know, nominate, it's a bit late

421
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,600
 for nomination now but it's not too late to vote. So I find myself, it's interesting because I feel

422
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:37,760
 very much at the time part of the FAN awards community and yet they're kind of persistent

423
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,800
 hatred of the hugos. I don't like, I kind of think the hugos are quite a good thing and

424
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:49,280
 not at all bad and it would be good if people who would like them to go to better things voted

425
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,280
 for those better things and nominated those better things and talked about those better things.

426
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,000
 John is a great fan of talking about the things you like loudly and often in the hopes that people

427
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,360
 notice. So I'm going to model that behaviour over the next year. I like Alison. She's good. Liz is

428
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:12,960
 alright too. I was going to say, Liz has just flipped me the bird listeners. Welcome to the

429
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,040
 Oxford Mutual Appreciation Society. I am Alison and I like Liz and John.

430
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:23,120
 So, yeah, no, I think and actually you've just said something that massively distills a lot of my

431
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,040
 thoughts about Corflu and the FAN awards which are that more and more I find that my perception

432
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,320
 of that small slice of fandom is that it defines itself in terms of negativity towards other slices

433
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,400
 of fandom that I am also in and although I like going to Corflu's and I like the FAN award,

434
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,320
 it is very difficult for me because whenever I interact with them, I am constantly reminded

435
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,000
 that there are lots of things I like that I am wrong to like and I find that very difficult

436
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:00,880
 and I think that is why I find it slightly frustrating sometimes. But I would say I was not,

437
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:09,200
 I think the FAN awards went to good winners and I did vote in the FAN awards. I don't know if the

438
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,680
 things I voted for won awards. Yeah, well, most of the things I voted for did win

439
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:25,600
 more so than in other. All right, taste maker. No, it's not that it's quite a small constituency

440
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,600
 and it's a very, very good, kind of obvious, like portable storage. I think one best

441
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,480
 fan of FAN for Stenzine and I have just got portable storage in the post and goodness,

442
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,760
 it's amazing. It'll be my pick next time unless something very strange happens.

443
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,800
 We can link to the summary of the winners and the full voting breakdown.

444
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:54,080
 We can non-exclusively reveal what won. So, the winners were in order of presentation

445
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:00,400
 the cover for Littlebrook 11 which was drawn by Ulrika O'Brien. Jerry Kalfman was awarded the

446
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,320
 Best Letter Hack award. Ulrika O'Brien also took home best fan artist Mark Plummer, friend of the

447
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:13,760
 podcast, took home best fan writer. Best One Shot was Dandrous Visions edited by Sandro Bond,

448
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,920
 Rob Jackson and Pat Verzi. Best Verzi was this here, Best Genzine was possible storage and number

449
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,320
 one fan face was Nick Fairey. And for those of us who were at the awards ceremony, there was a very

450
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:34,400
 funny bit where the first three awards announced were either Jerry Kalfman or somebody he published

451
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,960
 in Littlebrook. So, that was quite amusing. And in general, because Jerry was the MC for the awards.

452
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,640
 Good stuff. But yeah, congratulations to all the winners. Jerry Kalfman won Best Letter Hack,

453
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,320
 which is great and Mark was second, which is also great. And there are a lot of other letter hacks

454
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:57,840
 in there. But the letter hacks are overwhelmingly male and I don't think that absolutely reflects

455
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,880
 the people who are writing to fanzines and I think some women write very good letters to fanzines too

456
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,240
 and I would like to see this kind of tacit assumption that all the people who are writing letters to

457
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,480
 fanzines are boys be addressed in future voting chaps. This is a...

458
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,760
 I would like to say that you could nominate Alison for Best Letter Hack, but my experience is she

459
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,520
 only locks fanzines. She's got articles in. If my Lullzine is anything to go by, she's written as

460
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,960
 One Lock and it was for her own article, which I thought was very great. Have you sent me a Lullzine

461
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,400
 since then? You sent me a Lullzine, but it just reprinted something that you'd already...

462
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,280
 Oh, quite possibly. I just thought it was bloody great. I just... I really enjoyed it.

463
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,320
 I did get a... I did get one vote for Best Letter Hack, but that was not in fact the letter hacker.

464
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,800
 Either of the letter hacks I was thinking of or many of... there are many other great female

465
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,960
 letter hacks who are writing letters to fanzines and um and you should look out for it's Claire and Sandra.

466
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,760
 [Music]

467
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:11,200
 Okay, so my pick is very science fictional and you'll understand why it kind of...

468
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,360
 it breaks a lot of assumptions we have about I think economics like as a science mostly,

469
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,800
 but also like some other sciences, which is that I, a millennial, have purchased a house

470
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,960
 and my house is great and it is incredibly esf-nal. So, hurrah! It has lots of science fiction in it

471
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,320
 listeners and I've just finished setting up my board game shelf and... right, no, sorry, I lie.

472
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,600
 I've just set up my games that are books and folders of cards shelf, which is worryingly full

473
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,680
 and I hadn't quite appreciated how much stuff I have until I put it all in one place. It's got

474
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,200
 my netrunner cards on it, Johnny. So that's good. I have a pick, which is which I am currently

475
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,080
 listening to My Real Children by Joe Walton. This is quite an old book and I'm listening to it as

476
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,600
 an audiobook for reasons that are really complicated but I'm super enjoying it. It is a book in a

477
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:12,400
 category called Sliding Doors after the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow, which had two totally different

478
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,200
 versions of London, none of which neither of which bore any resemblance to reality. I don't know.

479
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,160
 The idea that you have a character who makes a choice and worlds spin in different directions

480
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,560
 as a result of that choice. My Real Children starts off feeling as if it is going to have almost no

481
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:37,360
 science fiction elements whatsoever but as the world views digress it... the worlds are quite

482
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:43,360
 different and they are quite different in some quite subtle ways and not necessarily in the ways

483
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:49,280
 that you might expect and the obviously our woman has two very different lives in the two

484
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,120
 different halves of the novel and I am enjoying it very much. I'm not quite finished yet though

485
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,880
 but I'm expecting to carry on enjoying it until the end of about 90% of the way through at the moment.

486
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,520
 So that is my pick for this week. My Real Children by Joe Walton, who is a fantastic author.

487
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,240
 Just fantastic. I have only read among others but I did thoroughly enjoy it. I read it when it was on

488
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:18,320
 the Hugo Ballot and I did really like it but I have not read any of Joe's other work. So I should

489
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:24,880
 rectify that at some point. I also really really like Farthering and it sequels the small changes

490
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,120
 which is kind of a trilogy about a science fictional version of the mithards. I love it.

491
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,000
 I've had this audiobook for a very long time but for various reasons I had not read it and I got

492
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,080
 to the end of my Hugo nomination reading and went I cannot read any fiction unless I do it by audiobook

493
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:47,760
 because I'm so busy at the moment so I'm doing it as an audiobook. So normally I am

494
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:56,400
 split my reading so the science fiction gets read on e-book or paper and the kind of self-help

495
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,040
 books are what I normally do as audiobook because they just kind of wash over me and I don't ever

496
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:08,560
 get any better. I find non-fiction. I find non-fiction content is a lot easier to listen to than fiction.

497
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:16,000
 It just goes in my head better. That's why I like podcasts. I am going to pick. Oh I want to read this.

498
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,520
 The Last Graduate by Naomi Novick which is a sequel to a deadly education which Alison has

499
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,040
 previously picked as one of her picks. Yes so I read the sequel. I mean I enjoyed a deadly

500
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,200
 education but I didn't love it. I just I didn't really get on with the protagonist very much

501
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,520
 basically. So a dedication and a last graduate are both set in you know a magical school called

502
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,480
 the scholar mants where there are lots of deadly monsters ready every turn to try and kill all the

503
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:52,160
 young young magicians in the school and in the first one. Why most schools? Yeah and in the first one

504
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,600
 we see the protagonist go from kind of you know the the outcast who is you know friends with no one

505
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,880
 very much just her own thing to kind of you know getting a sort of you know group of friends around

506
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,200
 her and making some connections and working out kind of her place in things but because of that in

507
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,600
 the first one you see a go from someone who's sort of very prickly and standoffish and you know

508
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:21,120
 connected with no one and I didn't find that particularly fun to read whereas in the second one

509
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,760
 it's kind of it picks up immediately. She's basically now got a group of people that she knows and

510
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:33,040
 can trust and it focuses more on basically how this magical school and its structure is basically

511
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,880
 and I'm gonna it's not this is not really a spoiler but you know that the magical school is

512
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,280
 essentially terrible and people with the most power and privilege and wealth in a magical sense

513
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,720
 are gonna do okay and those who don't are probably gonna get eaten by the end of their first year

514
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,640
 and the second book definitely is starting to kind of dismantle this and say actually maybe

515
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,000
 this system is not that great and actually maybe the whole system of how the magical enclaves

516
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 work in the world is not that great and you can see like the protagonist finding her way to a way

517
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,640
 where she can do something to change this with the help of the kind of friends and supporters

518
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,000
 she now has around her. Now the key thing about this is that the reason she can do this is that she

519
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,440
 is an immensely immensely powerful wizard so that also feels a bit like a you know a bit of a sort of

520
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,440
 sort of like death ex machina kind of thing that she it only works because she's incredibly

521
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,280
 powerful and has an incredibly powerful ally so if you can get with that then it's pretty good.

522
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,000
 Is the daughter of an incredibly powerful wizard as well so it's a bit of that going on too?

523
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,480
 Yes I mean there's still some things I just like I think the pacing is still a bit off and it kind

524
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:54,240
 of drags a bit in the second half. The first book had some problems with its depictions of like

525
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,520
 non-white characters and I think that has improved because it's focusing more on

526
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,920
 you know it's focusing more on different aspects of privilege I think so so I felt this one was

527
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,480
 was somewhat better but the kind of protagonist is still of mixed heritage which

528
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,680
 is basically very rarely mentioned I almost completely forgotten about that and then it kind of

529
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,640
 get mentioned about halfway through and I'm like oh yes that was a backstory and also the ending is

530
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,120
 like oh yes of course that happened I knew that was going to happen because that's the way you have

531
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,680
 to keep the tension going for the third book but other than that I did enjoy it and I will read

532
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,160
 the third or which I think has the potential to be a very different sort of story in the way that

533
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,880
 the second book leaves it and yeah I enjoyed it. It's also one of those books that you absolutely

534
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,320
 like devour like I think I read it over two days or something you just sit down it's very

535
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,720
 more rich and you keep turning the pages which is definitely one of Noremeneurvic skills.

536
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,880
 I assume that the point about her being a powerful wizard and having a powerful mother

537
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,840
 is not in order to effect change to class-based systems in the real world you also need to have

538
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:08,960
 a little bit of privilege to help you along right so like that doesn't seem like a bad point to me.

539
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,600
 Yeah yeah but the point is that the reason she is a very powerful wizard who has a very powerful

540
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:22,000
 mother but does not herself have privilege is because her mother explicitly rejected it before

541
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,480
 the series of book starts so so she's been kind of she's kind of been set up as an outsider star

542
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,760
 you know. Yeah I mean I haven't read the second book yet.

543
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,120
 Yes but I mean there's kind of magical power and there's kind of you know there's sort of two

544
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,440
 aspects so there's raw magical power and yeah the structural power of how the kind of wizarding

545
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:48,080
 society is structured and she has the former but absolutely does not have the latter and it's how

546
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,480
 she kind of teams with people who have the latter essentially. I mean it does feel in in some ways

547
00:46:52,480 --> 00:47:00,160
 like a bit of a reposter to Harry Potter where you know magical society is completely broken

548
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,960
 and no one seems to be bothered by this. It's very clearly a reaction to Harry Potter.

549
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,200
 I quite like the way in the first book and it sounds like in the second book that it is

550
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,600
 kind of challenging some of the underlying class assumptions that are in the Harry Potter books

551
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,040
 that's good. And which don't get challenged despite the fact that you think that the Harry

552
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,360
 Potter novels are setting them up for challenge it turned out that it was much easier and better

553
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:33,040
 for rolling in terms of her success to just kind of perpetrate them perpetuate them.

554
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:40,000
 Yeah so so this is good in that way. That was the Octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me.

555
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,320
 It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.

556
00:47:45,200 --> 00:48:02,640
 [Music]

557
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:11,120
 I will find a photograph of me to put in the show notes which demonstrates how sweaty I get when I

558
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:18,560
 dance and the answer is very so like I was at a wedding disco and like I'm just so sweaty.

559
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,320
 I don't know if you can tell how sweaty I am from the photo but it's a great photo so

560
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,760
 it's going in the show notes anyway.

561
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,160
 As long as it's a great photo it can go in the show notes I think.

562
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:32,000
 Okay that photo can oh god that photo could go in the show notes that's quite funny photo.

563
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 Anyway I think a lot of this should probably go because we're talking nonsense and we're still

564
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,080
 on the letters of comment. Did you miss us listeners are you happy we're back we're talking nonsense

565
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,520
 and we're still in the letters of comment. I've really missed you guys.

566
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,720
 That's not even your wedding is it John? No that is my friend Chris's wedding.

567
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,800
 There is a photo of me at a different wedding in which I am sweaty yeah which is this wedding.

568
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,480
 You just always tie your tie around your head if you get a bit sweaty.

569
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:07,440
 Obviously why else is it therefore? Spilling ketchup on oh god that's quite intense that is

570
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,160
 that is very intense. I look like I've just been working out in the gym in that last one.

571
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,400
 That's a proper proper sway mess. You look like you're about to hack a hole in a door with an axe

572
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,840
 and stick your head through it John. I was gonna say you look like you should be carrying a big

573
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:29,360
 sword with murderous intent to that one. Huddley you guys might be able to see can you see these

574
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:34,560
 pictures like directly on my Facebook if I just post this link in can you just go through because

575
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:41,120
 there's like a bunch of them from the just got like a you just have like an album of John being

576
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:47,440
 sweaty. So it's a very niche Facebook album. Are you like sending you know paid access links to it?

577
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:55,920
 Oh these are all gold. I know right but I go hard at weddings Liz I when I'm dancing I'm

578
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:03,040
 moving. I'm moving about and I am sweaty. Good thought. There is like not a single photo of you.

579
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:09,120
 I have a dynamic man with dynamic. Even the one where it's just literally your head over

580
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,800
 someone else's shoulder. Oh and now you're on a convention panel and you look you look
