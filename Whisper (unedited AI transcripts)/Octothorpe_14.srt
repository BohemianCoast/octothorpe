1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Oh, she gone again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Gone again.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 I think you should put all the... she's gone again together for the end of the podcast.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 14th episode of Oxford Thore by a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 This is the episode for the 17th of September 2020.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm Alison Scott.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And I'm Liz Batty.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 We have had a plethora of letters of comment since the last time we recorded.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Okay, so I've talked to you about plethora before, John.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 It's not a word that means many.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 It's a word that means too many.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And we haven't really had a plethora of locks.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We have had a sufficiency, a delightful collection of locks.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Many of you have written.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 But it's not a plethora because when you have a plethora of courgettes, it is a word that means glott.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Whoa! No one could ever possibly have too many courgettes, Alison.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Have you ever grown courgettes, John?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 No.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Right. There we go then.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Yes, we have.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 We got one single entirely spherical courgette.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 It was magical.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 A perfectly round courgette.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I say I grew it.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 It's spanyate grow it.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I watched.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Yes. So another year.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So what's your courgettes really?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Once you get the hang of it, you will have a year.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I went to a gig once where the guy stood on stage and said,

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 "And if you buy a CD, everyone who buys a CD gets a free bag of courgettes."

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 That's a good deal. That's just a good deal.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I will note that we recorded for, I think, approximately 35 seconds

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 before we delved into a rabbit hole of courgettes and folk music,

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 which is pretty good for us, I think.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 According to my dictionary app, Alison,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 strictly a plethora is not just an abundance of something,

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 but it is an excessive amount.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 However, the new looser sense is now so dominant that it must be regarded

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 as part of standard English.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Yeah, well, just because your dictionary app isn't...

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We're upholding Fowler's standards or whatever.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Hey, I'm a...

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'm a descriptivist. Not a prosperous tourist.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I mean, you know, words change.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I understand that the...

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I just don't feel that... I feel that when you use plethora,

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 quite a lot of people will take the negative meaning

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 along with the positive one.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Whereas there are other words that have just kind of...

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 float happily into the language and nobody has a problem with them anymore.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I mean, nobody... people who still complain about the use of the word,

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 hopefully, to mean, "I hope that I feel...

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I feel those people have lost."

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 But I think those of us who are still arguing about plethora are gonna...

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Anyway, we have not in fact had a plethora of locks, so please write in.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 We have had a myriad of letters of comment.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Mira's good. That probably means more than four.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Let me double check.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 According to my dictionary app,

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 myriad is... er... a noun.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 A countless or extremely great number of people or things.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 One, too many lots.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 This is a myriad.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Countless.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Countless.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Countless.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 My dictionary also says that,

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 although Tiefling classical history, it was a unit of 10,000.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And we have not had that meaning number of locks yet.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 We haven't had that many listeners, frankly.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 No.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Somebody said on Zoom that they really enjoyed "Octe Thorp"

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 and waxed poetic about how marvelous it was for some time,

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 but I can't remember who it was.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Is that a dream you had?

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Er... you know, okay, I've been having some weird dreams recently.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Okay.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 So if it was you, then please write and tell us,

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 because telling me that you liked the podcast in Zoom,

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 while very gratifying, does nothing for my co-host.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 We also had a discord, er... mention of comment, I guess.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So you can add that into the myriad pile.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Yay!

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Who was our discord mention of comment, Liz?

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Our discord mention of comment was from Listen A Chance,

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 who said "excellent trashing of the MCU".

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And this is the sort of comment that means we do not want to pivot

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 into being an MCU podcast.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 We would alienate at least one listener and one co-host.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Thank you very much to Listen A Chance for writing in.

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And frankly, we cannot afford to lose any listeners or co-host.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 No, no we cannot.

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 The second letter of comment out of our new five is Mark Plummer,

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 who felt guilty that he had only written last episode

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 with a pedantic correction and said

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 that Octa thought is a really good thing generally.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And he said he agreed with Liz about NASVIC panels

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 on researching the Golden Age, and he agreed with Alison

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 about there shouldn't be anything about the NASVIC

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 in the Wispers Constitution.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And then he said that he was sure he must agree with me

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 about something, but he can't think what it is.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So thanks, Mark.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 That made me feel nice.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Oh, and also he wrote in to correct us because panels

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 from the NASVIC are available online.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I think I did link them in last episode's show notes,

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 but basically there are a couple of videos on Vimeo,

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 which appear to be all of the panels just in what long video.

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So we will link those again in the show notes this week.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 He thought we were marvelous.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I mean, more people could write to say how good we are

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 and not argue.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Liz is nodding contentedly.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Yeah, I like all that as a comment that say

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 you're really good and I agree with you.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Please send them all in.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Lillian writes in and says that no one needs ten minutes for a poo.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Lillian is a thing. I think wrong.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I mean, I think I'll go with nobody should need ten minutes

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 for their poo.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And quite a lot of people seem to need more time for a poo

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 than they ought to.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 But, you know, don't write in.

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I will say that to be honest, I have not made a habit

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 of timing my bowel movements.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And I think that way lies nothing good and I will not be doing it.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And she also writes in about Gathertown saying

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 that it's the state of the art right now for virtual drinks.

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 It seems quite good.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 It's based on Jitsi, I think.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Jitsi is doing the underlying bits of the video.

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 I would like us to practice with Gathertown and High Fidelity,

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 both of which I quite like.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And it feels like you could have a model where you used Gathertown

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 for your...

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Either Gathertown or High Fidelity for your general

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 milling about space for a virtual event before

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 actually putting people into zooms for more serious matters or stuff.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I saw a mention somewhere on Facebook,

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 and I will try and find out where that zoom was going to let you

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 choose your own breakout room soon.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Really?

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 That would be very good.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 It was from Tammy Coxen on the Joff Facebook group saying

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 that you can now create...

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Host can create breakout rooms and participants can decide

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 which breakout room they want to join.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 This is a feature that should have been implemented just from a

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 professional perspective a while back because there are multiple

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 kind of informal workshops where you do rotate between breakout

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 rooms and that is a desirable thing to do.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 So I am a little bit surprised to take them this long, but I'm

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 glad that they're now getting around to it.

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 So she also mentioned zoom fatigue.

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I think that is a very real thing.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I have...

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I canceled plans yesterday because I was like,

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I could spend more time on my computer, like talking to my

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 friends, or I could sit in the garden and read a book with my

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 cats and the garden sounded better.

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And I think it is tricky.

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I am learning that although I crave social interaction,

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I also crave time away from screens more than I did pre-lockdown.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And so I am finding that that is an interesting balancing act.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And the way I'm basically doing it is less sort of...

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I kind of mostly do one zoom at the weekends usually, but then

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 like the rest of the weekend is spent doing more physical

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 things in the real world.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And then during the week I then spent a lot of time on my

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 computer.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 How are you two finding that kind of division?

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 If I ever run an online convention, I'll want to make sure that

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 some of the activities require the members to do some things that

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 aren't just sitting at their computer.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I want to build in physical activity that's a bit like the

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 pool tournaments or dots tournaments or hanging out at the

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 garden type things that small, famished conventions have

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 traditionally had.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 So that, I mean November is not the perfect time, but we should

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 be trying to make sure that some of the activities that the

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 convention require you to do things that aren't actually at your

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 desk in order to get the most fun out of the con.

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Like, I don't know, scavenger hunt or local...

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Or like a show and tell where you tell them on Friday to go out

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 to the local neighborhood and take some photographs or video of

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 something of interest and then we'll have a program item where

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 everyone comes and talks about those things for two minutes each.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 It's that sort of... you actually have to physically go and do

192
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 a thing that gets you off your backside.

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 We had a letter of comment from Karen Schafer who wrote to us

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 about a Liberty puzzle of Barcelona she offered her birthday,

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 which she completed while listening to our podcast.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 She is now very sad because she has finished the puzzle and

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 run out of octa-thorp.

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 So we are rectifying one of these problems for you, Karen,

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 right here.

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 So, hurrah!

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And thank you for listening.

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 She also assumes there must have been SF conventions of Barcelona

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 and indeed the 2016 Eurocon was held at Barcelona.

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I've put a blog post from Ian Watson who I think was involved

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 on the committee of that convention in the show notes.

206
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 I've also put a link to the Liberty puzzle, Karen did,

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 which looks beautiful.

208
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 It's a wooden jigsaw puzzle and you kind of...

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 *sings*

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Each of the landmarks and kind of people is at its own bit of wood.

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So even if you deconstruct the puzzle, you still have like all

212
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 of the pieces.

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 It's really, really beautiful.

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Oh, it really is pretty.

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 It is a very pretty puzzle.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I really like it.

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Turn out a 10.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 It's beautiful.

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I was like, I'm not going to puzzles.

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I have got slightly into doing paint by numbers,

221
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 which is light painting, but doesn't require me to have any

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 artistic ability, accept the ability to read a number and

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 stick within the lines.

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And I think it's probably going to take me several hundred hours

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 to complete it.

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So I find it quite a gentle thing to do while listening to

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 podcasts or watching the TV.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I do do jigsaw puzzles, but I have a strict...

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 You may not buy another jigsaw puzzle until you have done

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 all the jigsaw puzzles.

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And I also have a lack of space in my not very big house in

232
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 which to do jigsaw puzzles.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And I'm kind of looking at the absolute acres of crap piled up

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 in this room and going, I'm pretty sure there may be

235
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 some solutions involved throwing out a lot of this stuff.

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And then we would have more space.

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Which is actually the nice thing about paint by numbers is

238
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 they take much, much, much longer than a jigsaw puzzle,

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 but take up about the same amount of space as a jigsaw puzzle.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Finally, a letter from Eispania Cheriff,

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 odd name.

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 She says that a lot of what we mentioned for tealers is

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 true of the art show as well, and talks about kind of technical

244
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 issues and the huge variability of how art shows have been done

245
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 at conventions, and then talks about discoverability and

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 promotion as well like we did.

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And then mentions that FutureCon is coming up September

248
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 17th to 20th, and I have put a link to that in the show notes.

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And also notes that we might want to add the Octa Torp email

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 address to our Facebook and Twitter because she couldn't find

251
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 it until I told her to check the show notes.

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So yes, I don't know who's in charge of those things.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I don't think it's me.

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I think Octa thought, well I think I've invited you to be

255
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 your own admin, you both to be admins of the Facebook page,

256
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 but yeah, I'll put it on the, um, remind me.

257
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I could theoretically do that right now.

258
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And I will put it on the Twitter's.

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 I told her to put it at the end of the lock so I could ask you

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 to do it because I didn't want to.

261
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Because I'm a champ.

262
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Um, but yes.

263
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Um, so yeah, thank you very much to everyone who wrote in with locks.

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 They were lovely.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Um, I do know that obviously we always like hearing that we're

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 right about everything and they were great.

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 So if you think that, please do tell us in writing.

268
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Um, and also if you have any more poetry, um, yeah.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 I mean, the poems this week were very good, but they were less

270
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 rhyme focused than previous poems have been and mostly very

271
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 prosy on balance.

272
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 That didn't work.

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 No, I'm not sure that was funny.

274
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Were there any poems?

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 No, that was his joke.

276
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 It was a joke.

277
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Oh, so that was like one of these things that has the accident

278
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 of a joke, but not actually the substance of it.

279
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 F*** it out.

280
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Excellent.

281
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Jesus.

282
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 [Music]

283
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Can I also say that FutureCon looks really good and I already love

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 them because they list the times of their panel in like seven

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 time zones and so I do not have to go and get a time zone.

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Couldn't hurt it.

287
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Well, I do, but only to work out which one is closest to me so I

288
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 can take an hour off.

289
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 So I already like that.

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I got in trouble of a discord I am a member of because I said,

291
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 why don't they just do what my Arkham Horror Convention did,

292
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 which is to convert it into the time zone according to your IP

293
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 address and I got a shout-out at because apparently that's evil,

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 but it was very useful and I think more conventions should do it.

295
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 It is very useful, but it actually has a very weird, there's a

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 weird side effect for it, which is, but the NASFIC had an

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 unofficial connapass like thing of their schedule and what,

298
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 you know, connapass is just like a nicely laid out web version of a

299
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 program, but the thing it does is it automatically picks up your

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 time zone, presumably from your IP or whatever, maybe from your

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 browser and then tries to tell you what items are coming up shortly,

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 but it doesn't convert the actual time zone.

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 So what would happen is it would try and show me remaining program

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 items that were going to happen in my time zone, which because I was

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 actually looking at schedule where all the times of 12 hours behind

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 because it was an American one was nothing and then show me nothing.

307
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Yeah, that doesn't, that isn't how I would implement the feature.

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 No, it was, it was broken in a really weird way, but probably no one

309
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 has thought about the problem of what if someone is looking at the con

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 schedule in a different time zone when it's something that was

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 basically implemented for physical conventions.

312
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 When I started my business, one of the things I discovered very

313
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 early on is that in the sort of long lists of things that no tech

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 companies do very well, it turns out that time zones breaks all

315
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 sorts of platforms in all sorts of ways all over the world, all the

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 time and huge and it turns out that, that and currency conversion

317
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 are just vastly more complicated than you would ever believe

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 possible for something that's just, that looks quite simple, but is also

319
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 assuming that the work week runs Monday to Friday isn't actually

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 true in quite a lot of countries. Yes, we're also assuming that the

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 weekends, the, the, assuming that the week starts on a Sunday, even that

322
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 isn't true in the UK, like, because we start the week on a Monday and the

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 US starts their week on the Sunday, which is weird, I don't understand

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 why that is different, but it is. So yeah, there's a lot of assumptions

325
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 about time. It is tradition. This is another old people thing, it is

326
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 traditional for the week started Sunday in Britain. On Thursday, if you're at

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Cambridge University. And all of this stuff, but the thing about time zones

328
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 and money is that even, even not allowing for weird assumptions about how

329
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 things work that are wrong or not, not universal enough. Time zones, the

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 business of dealing with time zones breaks websites. They don't cope

331
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 with things that are in one day for one for a user and a different

332
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 day for the platform. And every time you mention this, people are like,

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 oh, and it is because most tech companies are run by a bunch of

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 bros who live in California and haven't really ever lived anywhere else,

335
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 especially anywhere else that's more than three time zones away.

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 There might be some truth to that, but I'm also pretty sure that like

337
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Apple and Google and Microsoft hire quite widely internationally. So I

338
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 am wondering to what extent that is quite as true as it might be. I think

339
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 like having done some work with time as my day job, it is surprisingly

340
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 difficult to do on computers because it's non regular and computers like

341
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 nice regular things. It's a similar reason to why translation of language is so

342
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 hard because it's working out how to do certain things which are incredibly

343
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 difficult and incredibly not strictly logical and computers are bad at that

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 generally. So it might be that it is also a difficult problem. I will say about

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 future con that there doesn't seem to be any social plan beyond we have a

346
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 discord, so it doesn't address any of the problems you have previously noted

347
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 with conventions, Alison, and it probably means I won't attend either because

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 as mentioned, or previous episodes for me, conventions are predominantly social

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 spaces. And if a convention has a strong social space like regular parties and

350
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Zoom hangouts, then I'm much more likely to attend than I am if it's a

351
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 discord with lots of panels because I don't find that as engaging. Yeah, no, I

352
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 agree. So please people go out there and run small conventions that are mostly

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 focused on creating social spaces for people who are interesting to chat to.

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I think that's true, but I think also the problem is if you're explicitly

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 running a convention where you are trying to say, you know, have two blocks of

356
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 panels so that basically the whole world can get to warm up other of those panels.

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 There then probably isn't a lot of space to do social spaces that would be in a

358
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 time zone for everyone and then you have to make a choice about which time zones

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 is your social time accessible to, you know, if you're doing it on a weekday,

360
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 the main at very much point about having social stuff that takes place at 2pm

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 to a lot of people. I think it is quite tricky. It's the state of mind that says

362
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 that having panels is a critical part of having conventions and cannot be

363
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 discarded, but having a functioning social space is a nice to have. Now for me,

364
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 that's the other way around. Yes, for me too. I have gone to conventions that

365
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 have had no programming whatsoever and they've been fun. I mean, and there is

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 a question about what constitutes a convention with no programming that is

367
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 different from a bunch of mates meeting up for a weekend. They are making

368
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 assumptions about the core of a convention which are not the assumptions

369
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 that are true for me, which is fine because there will be people for whom

370
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 those assumptions are true and that's the audience they're appealing to. But I think

371
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 as a member of fandom who is not in that audience, I don't think there's any

372
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 point of pretending that I am. So clearly there needs to be a primarily

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 focused convention quite soon. When I was trying to understand why there aren't

374
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Zoom parties happening alongside the panels, because then if I was a

375
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 slot where I wasn't bothered about, I'd go into the parties. It doesn't seem

376
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 like a difficult problem to solve to me and maybe I'm just not thinking about it

377
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 properly, but like you just have parties and then people will be in the parties who

378
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 want to be in the parties and people who watch the panels who want to watch the panels.

379
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I think that's fine, but I think this is, it feels like this is in some ways

380
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 explicitly pushing back against the trend for conventions to be not more

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 accessible but less accessible to a lot of people in the world. And so they've chosen

382
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 that as the thing they're explicitly going to try and mitigate against with this

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 comp. Is it your perspective that it wouldn't be possible to do a convention that was

384
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 accessible that had accessible social spaces? No, I think my position is that

385
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 the vast majority of online events so far have catered primarily to mostly

386
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 US time zones and sometimes from European time zones. And what they've done is

387
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 decided what we're going to focus on is trying to have something which feels truly

388
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 worldwide and their focus is therefore to get a set of panels together which are

389
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 running times that are a bit more accessible to people around the world.

390
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And I don't think they're that interested in doing the social space that goes with

391
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 them. But I think also when you have probably limited time windows to do things

392
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 in, they've decided the best thing to do is to put panels in those time windows

393
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 and to have a discord to be their social space. Because for a lot of people I think

394
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 discord would work as a social space. I think that's what Alison and I said we

395
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 are aware but that is because they're prioritising panels. I think they could

396
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 have done an accessible international convention where they prioritise social

397
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 space and that would also have worked. And I think the fact they haven't done

398
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 that is a valid point to criticise them on. Yeah, no, I agree. Yeah, and also I feel

399
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 like it's not impossible to have global party spaces because New Zealand having

400
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 although we were quite skeptical about their plan to run parties for three

401
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 hours every eight hours, that did actually work perfectly well. And most people,

402
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 most places in the world could get to one of those party blocks or a second one if

403
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 they were properly into parties or a third one if they were really far more into

404
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 parties than was good for them. And I think having a kind of limited length to

405
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 the parties also worked quite well because there is a tendency for international

406
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Zoom parties to go on forever in a way that is less fun than you would think

407
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 if you're the host. Ask me how I know this. Yeah, I think that is probably fair.

408
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 But I think you have said a few times Alison that you think the best model for

409
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 this kind of thing is to do sort of five hours of panels and three hours of

410
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 social spaces and that allows most people worldwide to access at least two of the

411
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 three kind of blocks. And I think in general if I was going to try and do this

412
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 kind of thing that is the kind of model I would take. I think BaltaCon kind of did

413
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 this but they forgot the parties afterwards and just did the five hours of

414
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 programming which was my criticism. That was, I don't think you mean BaltaCon

415
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 do you mean reconvene? Yes, I mean reconvene. Yes. And I think it would have been,

416
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I just, yeah, like I said, I think there's not enough. I think these are all

417
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 problems that would be soluble if people were trying to solve them. I think my

418
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 problem is that they're not. It might be to do with the Zoom fatigue we were

419
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 talking about because like if you have like social spaces that are sitting on

420
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 your backside in front of the computer it doesn't necessarily feel different to

421
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 sitting on your backside in front of like a panel. And I think that is a tricky

422
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 thing because at a convention going to the bar, I had there's like a mental

423
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 separation to that where it's a space that is set aside for relaxation whereas

424
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 obviously if your home office is also the place where you watch your panels and is

425
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 also the place where you drink with your friends, that mental separation is much

426
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 much harder to come by. I think that is a real problem but I don't know to why

427
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 extent it can be fixed. I agree. Doing it off screen today. Do you think the block,

428
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 especially for New Zealand though, do you think having blocks of panels and then

429
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 blocks of parties made a lot more work for the people running parties? I think

430
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 the fact that there was essentially one person in charge of all the parties

431
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 is a lot more work for the people running parties and I kind of, there are always

432
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 ways that Americans do their world con running that I always look at and go

433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 in Britain we have a model for con running that doesn't work like this and you

434
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 know that this is insane guys and people just kind of shrug. I don't think they

435
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 didn't really have blocks of parties, panels and then have blocks of parties.

436
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 They had programming essentially through the day and into the evening

437
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 every day with the evening things not being the sort of lighthearted things

438
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 that we'd have in the evening but being more sort of European timed serious

439
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 thing. So I found myself on program at eight o'clock in the morning, New Zealand

440
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 time and ten o'clock at night New Zealand time one day which is quite hard and

441
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 then the parties just slotted into that so they didn't have breaks in the

442
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 programming and I think for a world con you might not want to have breaks in

443
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 the programming but I think for a smaller convention or a convention that was

444
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 more conspicuously global rather than being grounded in New Zealand you might

445
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 say you could do round the clock sets of panels and ask but it does make the

446
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 job of programming people onto panels even harder than it might be otherwise

447
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 because it's all too easy to say that that panel is perfect for that person

448
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 but that is at four o'clock in the morning their time. Yeah and like if

449
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 anyone was to run a small fanning convention online I think these are the

450
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 sorts of things I want to be thinking about because you don't want to make

451
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 it so difficult you don't want to plan to do the perfect convention but have that

452
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 be such a difficult thing to achieve that you end up burning out before you get

453
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 anywhere near it because like that is the problem with a lot of fan activity you

454
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 shoot really really high and you end up not be able to get there so you fizzle

455
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 but I think there is room for improvement on the formula that is

456
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 relatively low hanging I think and I'm hoping I feel like we've settled into a

457
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 little bit of a this is how it works and I'm not sure that model of how it works

458
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 is actually a thing that really works for me so at this point I'm starting to be

459
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 louder about I think there needs to be more innovation here because I don't

460
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 think we've solved the problem yet and I think the fact that a lot of these

461
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 conventions are looking very very similar means that I'm worried that there are

462
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 people that think we have solved the problem if that makes sense maybe I'm being harsh

463
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I think that one of the ways you could do it for a small convention is to not make

464
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 it conspicuously global and I think to some extent that's what reconvened it though

465
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 it didn't have parties but so if I was running a small fanning convention I would

466
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 probably say up front this is a small British fanning convention and of course

467
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 we welcome our friends from countries that are not the UK and of course we will try

468
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 to do something that are inclusive but primarily the times that we party are

469
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 going to be the times that we party and we might call our social spaces in the

470
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 morning coffee and if it's like 11 o'clock at night for you that doesn't mean you're not very

471
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 welcome but it's a it's a coffee break rather than a party yeah but I think and

472
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 maybe that actually gets back to what Liz was saying which is maybe this is very

473
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 difficult to do in a way that is international because you do run into those

474
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 fundamental clashes between the coffee and beer time zones yeah I will say having

475
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 been to kind of international parties which you know basically have continued

476
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 through my night and I am now joining in the morning it is fun but it's very

477
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 different joining a party when you've just woken up and it's early on in your

478
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 eating breakfast and other people are like at the very end of their drinking and it's 3am

479
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 the vibe is quite weird yeah cuz I remember you came to Allison's Easter

480
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 comparti and I know he was like it was 3am and I had quite a lot of beer and two

481
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 pizzas and you were like I mean in coreflakes and I was like Liz you were like

482
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 hello John so yeah I think I think that might be I think it depends on your kind

483
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 of party idea because that was nice but I did feel like I have missed out on a

484
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 nice night of fun party with people on zoom and I can chat to them now but

485
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 they're gonna drift off and fall asleep in a heap in a moment I will have so

486
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 long over the next day excellent yeah whereas if the EasterCon I have had

487
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 breakfast I mean I've had breakfast at EasterCon with people who had still been

488
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 partying but that feels different because then there is still a whole

489
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 convention for you to go to like I can have breakfast with people who are super

490
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 hungover and about to go to bed and I'm about to start the day but that feels

491
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 a bit different because I've got a day to start with well maybe that means that

492
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 doing this kind of like 3a tower block idea means that that would work

493
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 because you'd be like well yes okay I have missed out on this party but in five

494
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 hours there will be more parties that are perhaps better situated for me and I

495
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 get panels in the interim yes I would I think that would work very well for a

496
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 truly global convention that would all not just be truly global in concept but

497
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 also would expect to be the sort of size that that that global reach encompasses

498
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I think it's gonna be hard to make that sort of thing work if you're talking

499
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 about a couple of hundred people and I think it will probably work a lot better

500
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 with a couple of thousand to fill up all those spaces around the clock so that

501
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 people didn't discover that there were actually batches of it when the only

502
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 people who were awake were in Polynesia I think if you were if I was planning like

503
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 a truly global online Worldcon then I think that is a sort of thing I might

504
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 think about can I get sufficient people from sufficient different places that we

505
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 can really feel like this is global and going all the time

506
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 pre-support global globecon here by sending your $10 to Liz Patti

507
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 never share a globecon

508
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 hahaha yes you heard it here folks yeah Liz Liz said she'd never share a

509
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Worldcon she didn't say she'd never share a globecon

510
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 I really like the idea I really like the idea of getting rid of all of Worldcon's

511
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 baggage by just launching globecon you know fed up of the waspus constitution

512
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 it is it's dangerous I'm not running a business meeting I'm not running he goes

513
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I'm not running a Natsvik you're running the Globos the Globos please please can we have the

514
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Globos I I visited it as like you know in the hitchhikers guide how there's the

515
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 party that's been going forever and has now gone into space and goes raiding

516
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 other planets to get stuff for their party that's why I see the convention

517
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 as it just goes on forever raiding other convention discords I'm getting more and

518
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 more hungover oh wow mmm basically I like this I like this plan a lot

519
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 that that endless party in fact many of the endless parties in science fiction

520
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 has been in my head for the last six months I feel like I may be living it

521
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 but raiding other conventions discords is great this is something I don't know if

522
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 you two have done a lot of because obviously most fanning conventions have been doing their panels on Zoom

523
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 but the gaming convention I've been to have been running their program primarily

524
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 on Twitch and the nice thing about that is that when a program item ends you can

525
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 raid someone else's twitch channels with the convention has three programming

526
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 streams when one ends you can basically just redirect that stream to a stream

527
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 that's still going which is actually really cool except for the one time where a serious

528
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 D&D actual play that was all full of like drama and character moments was invaded

529
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 by drunk people who had just watched the dark room with John Robertson and the vibes

530
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 of the two fan bases were quite different I would say it was very funny I suspect it was

531
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 less funny for the people who were in the D&D half of the experience

532
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 anyway so are you saying that if we were to run a small fanning convention we would want

533
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 to do it on Twitch I don't know I don't know how difficult because I think I think

534
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 you add overhead doing it that way because with Zoom obviously it merges all

535
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 of the panelists video into like a place where you can watch it and you don't have

536
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 none of the panelists have to do any tech wrangling for that to occur I think

537
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 obviously with Twitch what you need is like you need to have someone who is like taking

538
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 all of the video streams and sewing them into a single video stream and then

539
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 outputting that to Twitch I have no experience with that I don't know how hard it is

540
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 that's probably quite hard okay so not then but but what you seem to be saying that

541
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 some that Twitch could be good for some sorts of things and fans are mostly not using

542
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Twitch for their online activity much at the moment though though I do use Twitch

543
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 I've used Twitch as a means of displaying a list of who's in the breakout rooms

544
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 at the first Thursday meeting because Twitch is actually a very easy way to get

545
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 what is on your computer screen onto the internet without very much fuss oh that's a good idea

546
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 for those who are brought out in the proverbial screaming heebie-jeebies by discussion of

547
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 the dreaded virus you may want to skip to the next chapter which is a better bit

548
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 and has Marvin in it but for those of you staying with us then we're going to discuss

549
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 a little bit about what the UK's current rise in cases of COVID-19 and

550
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 ensuing clamp down back down to it being illegal for more than six people to meet

551
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 together what that might imply for EasterCon because obviously if things were just

552
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 continually gradually tailing off we might be quite optimistic about EasterCon

553
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 but the fact that things are looking like they're getting a little bit worse

554
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 makes us a little bit nervous I think so Liz you are our you are OctaThorps

555
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 coronavirus correspondent I'm not sure if I want that position or not

556
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 you don't have to have coronavirus to do it if that changes your mind

557
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 oh that's good that's good um yeah so I think I sort of brought this up because

558
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 we haven't heard that much coming out of the 2021 EasterCon so far and when they

559
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 talked about the 2021 bid at the 2020 virtual bid session they didn't they were

560
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 definitely planning for an in-person convention and I think thinking about

561
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 whether they would run a virtual convention if it wasn't possible to run a 2021

562
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 EasterCon and I think at the time I thought oh 2021 yeah it's probably okay

563
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 like we stamp on the virus it goes down pretty low and then I think it's a case

564
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 of can we keep it that way and not have any more how to put this can not have

565
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,640
 any more big outbreaks and I was fairly optimistic that you probably could do

566
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,080
 that by 2021 but at the moment looking at it kind of six months later the UK

567
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,920
 managed to get transmission under control and keep it quite low but never

568
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,080
 actually completely like stamp it out and get down to the really super low

569
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,480
 levels we've seen in some other countries and currently it doesn't look

570
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,800
 like things are going in the right direction it looks like they might be

571
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,160
 going up again and we're gonna have to do some kind of partial lockdown or

572
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,080
 restriction of socializing kind of bringing back in more social distancing

573
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,240
 smaller groups again and based on that it's hard to know where it goes in the

574
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,440
 next few months based on the response over the past six months I don't have a

575
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,800
 super optimistic view of the UK actually getting to the point where they can get

576
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,360
 it down to near zero and then if they do see any outbreaks to have a system which

577
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,640
 works fast enough to do testing and contact tracing in order to bring those

578
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,720
 back down to zero again and so I'm worried about when the East Ocon might

579
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,680
 make the decision to go virtual when they will need to make the decision to go

580
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,120
 virtual and if they decide not to go virtual what does the East Ocon actually

581
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,520
 look like when you're planning six months out and you're really not sure

582
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,760
 how many people you'll be allowed to have in one room yeah I I share Liz's concern

583
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,520
 that the UK is not going to be in a position to put a thousand people in a

584
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,000
 hotel in a t-star I mean I think it's remarkably unlikely that we will be

585
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,680
 able to hold the East Ocon in the way that we're normally expecting to and I

586
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,880
 haven't I feel like I don't know why I do this I'm gonna say this thing and then

587
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,640
 you can all fall about laughing and then I'll apologize for it part of me

588
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,200
 looks to the East Ocon committee for guidance in these troubling times I

589
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,520
 expect the East Ocon committee to be proactively out there using their social

590
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,320
 media feeds and their means of contact of the community to be keeping us

591
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,120
 updated regularly to be letting us know their thinking on what's going on and I

592
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,000
 feel like they kind of from the point where we asked at the business meeting

593
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,840
 so what what plans have you got to take the convention virtual and they were

594
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,920
 kind of like what we haven't really thought about it yet to now I feel like

595
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,480
 I've heard almost nothing from them and it may be that I've been ignoring their

596
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,080
 their massive publicity campaign about their plans and what they're doing and

597
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,920
 what their thinking is so I wanted to see if you guys had heard anything from

598
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,280
 them and if I being a bit daft to expect East Ocon the East Ocon committee to have

599
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,600
 any greater role in this than just some people who were kind of running a

600
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,840
 convention like all the other conventions in progress report one Easter

601
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,440
 cog did say that they are continuing to plan for an in-person convention but

602
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,240
 they are doing so with a view to how they might make things work in a virtual

603
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,240
 world the fact that it's now September and things do not appear to be heading

604
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,480
 towards zero and there has not the government have like begun to think

605
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,880
 about how certain things can restart but I'd be extremely surprised if if large

606
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:17,480
 conventions with a lot of quite close commingling was a thing that was able to

607
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:23,920
 happen before Easter but I do think the Easter con committees communication up to

608
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:31,820
 this point has been sparse I feel that if I were the chair of next year's

609
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:37,720
 Easter con I would be talking to people okay so John Marshall might not have found

610
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,320
 that funny there you go I don't think you can be stopped from talking to people

611
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,680
 person so I realize this is a one year bid and one year bids have a very tight

612
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,880
 timeframe to get everything up and running even under the best of circumstances

613
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,560
 in 2020 is certainly not the best of circumstances and so I can I can

614
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,560
 definitely forgive them for maybe not being as communicative or as on top of

615
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,320
 things as other Easter cons have been but at the moment they're very quiet and

616
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,320
 we that we end up in the same situation but I think it would be a missed

617
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,280
 opportunity for people who enjoy this to try and have an enjoyable weekend to

618
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,080
 keep us going before we can all actually see each other in person again yeah so

619
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,400
 it is time to start thinking about what the options and ideas for an Easter weekend

620
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:32,000
 virtual event would be how that might look if if the current sitting Easter

621
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,560
 con committee did not want to run a virtual convention and what we would do

622
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,040
 about it if they didn't and when we need them to realistically be telling us

623
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,640
 what they're doing before we decide to seize control of the means of Easter

624
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:54,120
 con production and the thing that I think we can all agree on is the current

625
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:59,480
 sitting Easter con committee should show some leadership and should be saying

626
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,800
 some things about this if not now then very soon oh and furthermore Rob Jackson

627
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,720
 is still planning to run Corflu in Bristol and that's not gonna happen is it

628
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,880
 in February well especially not because transatlantic travel won't be possible

629
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,960
 by February like even if the UK is completely covid free in a way that means

630
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,880
 that we can have a convention so I think I mean it's definitely not going to be

631
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,640
 the usual 800 to 1000 person Easter con because that includes a fair number of

632
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:32,080
 overseas or the just who will be unable or willing to do inter-country travel

633
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:38,240
 can we talk very briefly about the magic vaccine which is not going to

634
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,200
 exist by Easter because I think people there are a lot of people still out there

635
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,280
 going oh vaccine it's going to be an amazing thing but it's not and we

636
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,120
 definitely won't have it by Easter. Am I exist by Easter you won't have it by

637
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:55,120
 Easter though. I think what I think is if there is somehow a combination of

638
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,440
 situations that means that if a thousand people congregate in Birmingham next

639
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,800
 year it won't be a problem from a public health perspective then I will be

640
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,000
 delighted and I will enthusiastically attend to these to con as normal but I

641
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,240
 think it is also my opinion that the chances of that are vanishingly small

642
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,160
 both from the perspective of COVID just giving up and going away and from the

643
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:19,680
 perspective of having a vaccine boy then so sadly I think that is I mean if it

644
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,720
 is possible brilliant and I will eat tumble by but my gut feeling is that it's

645
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,400
 probably not. It's not possible based on extrapolating from any of the current

646
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,240
 responses to the crisis in the UK so I think my question is is there any

647
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,580
 situation in which a smaller Easter con or even a hybrid in-person

648
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:49,040
 Easter con, in-person virtual Easter con would be run or is it a case of either

649
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,120
 we run something in person that looks a lot like the Easter con we expect maybe

650
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,240
 a bit smaller or we just go straight to virtual Easter con. I do feel that

651
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,160
 second question is very much something for the committee I mean they might

652
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:11,080
 reasonably say we will run the largest event we are legally allowed to or you

653
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:17,480
 could arrange to run a set of small events in different places. I'm not sure

654
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:24,000
 if things are as they are at present I'm not sure I would be prepared to go to

655
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,840
 an in-person con and I mean I speaking here as somebody who went to an actual

656
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,640
 COVID safe I think I'm gonna put COVID safe in square quotes because I'm not

657
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,440
 sure we really know what constitutes COVID safe but but a music event yesterday

658
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,040
 with 30 people at I mean which some some chatting happened where everyone

659
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,760
 kind of stood around more than six feet apart with masks on having

660
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:54,040
 conversations and and you could kind of see fans having a party a bit like that

661
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,120
 but it still wouldn't be any part of what I think of the Easter con as being

662
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:06,600
 and this was early September rather than February so February I'll put

663
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,400
 ignore me Easter because often the weather is very bad at Easter weekend

664
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,720
 is not in February no it's not when is you again next year is it April it's not

665
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:25,440
 next weekend either it's early April okay just just I'm definitely not suffering

666
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:34,800
 from confusion ha ha ha name of the con oh god it is at all it is I'm not saying

667
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,600
 that the convention committee have to be planning to run a online convention if

668
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,680
 COVID hasn't gotten into a manageable stay by then and I'm not saying the

669
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,120
 convention I'm not really saying the convention has to do anything I suppose

670
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,760
 the only thing I am saying the convention needs to do is communicate what

671
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,080
 their plans are openly and transparently with the community because if their

672
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,640
 plan isn't to run an Easter con if COVID is not under control it would be

673
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,120
 useful for other fans to know that in advance so we can start planning I think

674
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:11,080
 I would say that it is not unusual for the sitting Easter con to have not

675
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:16,640
 communicated clearly and cogently at this stage in the year for the following year

676
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,440
 and in fact the Easter con whilst not having a written constitution or even an

677
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,320
 unwritten constitution does have custom and practice for what we do in this

678
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,960
 situation which is that we sort it out at Novakon obviously we're not having an

679
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,760
 over con either but I mean as long as there is something happening over the

680
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,280
 Novakon weekend we would be able to at that point take stock of where the Easter

681
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,400
 con was at and whether they had communicated cogently about their plans

682
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,240
 and if they had not committed to educate cogently about their plans said well it

683
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,320
 it falls upon those of us here present to go well what do we want to happen

684
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,120
 over the Easter weekend let it let us make it so Spock I think and we have heard

685
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:03,160
 rumors I feel I feel I can feel I can discuss the rumors I've heard rumors that

686
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,360
 something will be happening over the Novakon weekend but obviously they are

687
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:14,320
 just rumors so we can't can't say any more here but there are rumors yeah one

688
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,520
 of the really strange things about doing a podcast about fandom is that there's

689
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,880
 another thing that is only rumors at the moment that I'm desperate to talk about

690
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,360
 on the podcast but at some point it will not be rumors and I'll be able to talk

691
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,320
 about but that's yeah that is for the podcast you know if you have any good

692
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,920
 rumors that we are allowed to talk about please do write to us so we will

693
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:38,160
 allude to them yes we will waggle our eyebrows significantly um so yeah so so

694
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,600
 if if something does happen over the Novakon weekend then hopefully this is

695
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:53,120
 something that can be discussed by fandom then um I think so obviously in order

696
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,720
 of preference I would like to see covid magically go away and there to be a

697
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,280
 proper Easter con with a drunk tobes at it second preference is to have a

698
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,680
 smaller Easter con which is you know and appropriate about people for the

699
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:13,920
 covid situation and for there to be a drunk tobes at it and then I think the

700
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,880
 third option is I would like there to be a virtual Easter con and I think that

701
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:24,840
 there should be a drunk tobes at it so I think do you think drunk and tobes is

702
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:30,000
 critical to your enjoyment of these two weekend I mean I think to the extent

703
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,960
 that Easter con has a constitution that constitution does involve tobes being

704
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,520
 drunk I remember Easter cons from before tobes attended them so if there is an

705
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:45,000
 Easter con held and tobes is not at it is it an Easter con this is the sort of

706
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,960
 dangerous and uncharted territory that I wish to avoid exploring what if tobes

707
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,040
 is at the convention but doesn't drink

708
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:04,360
 I don't I mean well I mean if we're going to talk about fantasy lands I'd

709
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:09,760
 also like to have Easter con on the moon okay so the moon is not in the United

710
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,280
 Kingdom and I think although we have stretched this point a few times I'm not

711
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,280
 sure we're gonna stretch it to the moon John

712
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:27,520
 here's your thing suppose Easter con went virtual what things would it have to

713
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,920
 properly encompass in order to feel like a proper Easter con apart from a drunk

714
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,840
 and so I was gonna be my first thing I think the things for me that make it

715
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:47,480
 Easter con at Easter con are good panels with fans on them good panels with pros

716
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:54,440
 on them but not solely pros I think I've seen a lot of conventions where I feel

717
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,680
 like most of the programming has been focused around people who are authors

718
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,400
 and people who are pros and I understand why because I think that gets people to

719
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:09,160
 attend but I would like to see it Easter con do more with with with you know

720
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,640
 the fandom and I think I think Conzeland did that well so I'm not saying that

721
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,440
 no one has done that but I think I think that would be good I think there

722
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,640
 should be a game component gaming component I don't know how that would

723
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,040
 work but I can think of some ways to do it I think there should be a thriving

724
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,160
 social space and I think there should be a bid session where people ask

725
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,440
 questions about whether or not there will be mushrooms at breakfast Liz what's

726
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,880
 an Easter con to you other than the wrong time zone yeah I think if it had

727
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,440
 everything you just laid out then it would feel like an Easter con I don't

728
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,880
 know I'm not very big on virtual socializing with people I don't already

729
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,200
 know well I find that difficult whereas it is much easier an Easter con for like

730
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,160
 someone I don't know to come up and join the conversation and get to know

731
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,480
 them and have a chat and I find that quite difficult over zoom or discord or

732
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:11,000
 whatever if you could if you had social spaces that were with that kind of six

733
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,720
 to eight to ten people consistently that you might have a rounder table in a bar

734
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:22,400
 it is actually quite easy to bring extra people into that and and you make

735
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,280
 friends of them over time as we've been seeing on the Internet all all this year

736
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,320
 I've made new friends I've there and I think the other thing is that people who

737
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,320
 are very very vague acquaintances of mine in March and now my friends purely

738
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,720
 because of our interactions over the Internet to an extent that I'm not sure

739
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,120
 I would have thought was possible so for me it is all about the social spaces I

740
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,160
 mean I understand that there have to be I don't just want program I don't want

741
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:56,200
 just what panels of fans and panels of pros and and I want there to be talks by

742
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,200
 interesting people that generate conversations about what they had to say

743
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,920
 and why it matters I want there to be extravaganza type events you know that

744
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,680
 just I mean not necessarily the disco but you know that are things that other

745
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,720
 conventions have not done and I don't know quite how you translate that to

746
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,840
 virtual but I you know one of the things about the East con is that it can have

747
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,720
 it can do things that no other British Convention has the scale and space to do

748
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,560
 and I think that the transition to virtual shouldn't prevent that from

749
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:34,720
 happening and so there's a it's an opportunity to think quite big in terms

750
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,480
 of what we can do what we could do at this convention that nobody has tried and

751
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,680
 I think I know what my friends to be at it lots and lots of my friends well

752
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,640
 that yeah that's fair I think I will say on the subject I think Liz is thing

753
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:56,880
 the thing you said Liz about not necessarily finding it easy to have online

754
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,440
 spaces where you socialize with people you don't know very well I think I do

755
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:08,680
 wonder to what extent that changes with the number of these things you attend

756
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,640
 because like I would have described myself in a similar situation at the

757
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,560
 start of lockdown but having been to a number of first Thursdays where and a

758
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:21,880
 number of boozy mooses where there are quite a few people I don't know I think

759
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,680
 I am kind of getting better at that in a in a way and I think Alison's point

760
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:33,480
 about smaller breakout rooms being good for emulating that kind of like you

761
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,040
 know these are this is a room and there are like six people in this room and

762
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,520
 three of them are people I know really well and two of them are people I've

763
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:45,080
 not met before but like that ratio is not unfavorable and the amount of new

764
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,840
 people is not overwhelming I saw his band was in a zoom conversation at one

765
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,560
 online con which I think there was about twenty-four people in and I sort of

766
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,760
 thought that I don't think I would enjoy I don't think that would work so I

767
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,320
 think having a lot of breakout rooms is like the only way to kind of try and

768
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:07,640
 deal with that if that makes sense. Maybe the only way at the moment but we

769
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,280
 don't want to solve the problems of six months time with the technology of now

770
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:19,720
 I think we are seeing the virtualization platforms continuing to compete for

771
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,320
 market share by generating new features that work and I think I think

772
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,440
 Discord is quite likely for a start-off to come up with things that feel more

773
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,280
 like a bar and there are definitely people out there trying to do that it's

774
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,680
 not just it's not just we're not the only people who want this to work. Yeah I

775
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,240
 think it's a probably not specifically me problem but I think I just find it

776
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,800
 harder to like follow the ebb and flow of conversation the dynamics of

777
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:54,320
 conversation on zoom and so six might be the maximum I can manage that with and

778
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:59,120
 I think eight to ten is probably more people than I can follow on a zoom so

779
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:04,280
 that makes it a little bit more difficult and I think it's more yeah it just feels

780
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,520
 like at a convention you might chat to someone on the first day and then maybe

781
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,880
 bump into them again on the third day and have a chat all sort of see them in a

782
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:16,520
 panel and say hello and those kind of repeat exposures may not happen quite so

783
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,840
 easily at a virtual convention. Yeah so that we maybe wanting to think about how

784
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:27,160
 we can do that I hate the idea of doing formal ice-breaking events but I think

785
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,320
 you may need to do some things that are quite like formal ice-breaking events

786
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,520
 in some way and that have some of the same especially for people who find it

787
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,040
 harder to make new friends. Maybe that's a thing that I think at a normal

788
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,960
 convention I would be a little bit more although I haven't said that maybe that

789
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,520
 is a good idea because like you do tend to find the conventions do get very

790
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,960
 clicky and like I am very aware even at physical conventions I do tend to spend

791
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,160
 the whole time hanging out with people I already know which is I like hanging out

792
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,840
 with people I know in the main unless I know them and think they're an idiot but

793
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:05,160
 that doesn't often happen in fandom. But I will say that like I do sometimes

794
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,560
 miss the days when I was very new to fandom and most of the people I met were

795
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,360
 people I did not know yet because that was quite fun. So maybe maybe that kind

796
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,680
 of thing would be a good addition. I don't know. I think this is one of the

797
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,280
 reasons why I wish more conventions were trying to solve the problem of online

798
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:27,560
 socializing because I don't think it is a well-solved problem but I equally don't

799
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:32,440
 think that we're going to solve it unless we carry on iterating on the

800
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,480
 formula if that makes sense. I think it's definitely something that you could try

801
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,440
 at a virtual convention and you know it would be opt-in to that ice breakers if

802
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,440
 you want to and if you don't feel that would work for you you don't need to

803
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,360
 kind of like sessions for newcomers at conventions in general. How to enjoy your

804
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,200
 first virtual Eastercon mandatory for everyone. I think I enjoy getting to know

805
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,640
 people through text chat much more than either of you do so that is also more

806
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,600
 of an option for me. That was the 14th episode of the UltaThore podcast in

807
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:12,960
 which John Liz and Alison agreed a lot and didn't argue at all. And it's goodbye

808
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,960
 from me. And it's goodbye from me. And it's goodbye from me. The theme music for

 I have it will not come as a it will not come as a surprise to anyone that the

812
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,560
 things I have been doing in lockdown are editing podcasts and playing our

813
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,680
 comorbid card game. And do you want to tell us about your new podcast John? I've

814
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:53,560
 got a new podcast Alison and it's when I play Arkham Horror of the card game in a

815
00:55:53,560 --> 00:56:01,000
 podcast. Mind blown. I've already got nine listeners. Nine. Smashing. How many of

816
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,280
 those listeners are related to you? Well, it's been your refuses to listen and I

817
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,560
 haven't told any of my family so I think none. How many of them are in your

818
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,360
 Arkham Horror regular Arkham Horror playing group? Oh, I assume I assume they're all

819
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,040
 people I don't want discord through Arkham Horror. So yes, that is a fair

820
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,760
 comment. But you know, still happy. One of them was me but I only listened up to

821
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,840
 point where you like mentioned the spoiler warning for games I haven't played and

822
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,760
 then I stopped listening. So not so that counts. Yes, I need to record some more

823
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:37,080
 people can listen to. I'm on it. Oh, sorry. There's a lizard on my wall. Like a

824
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:44,560
 gecko like this big. It's like a little gecko the size of a spider. Yeah, no,

825
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,760
 it's literally like about an inch and a half tall but it's just like run behind

826
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,160
 my curtain. But that's not really a big problem is it? No, but they go very fast

827
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,480
 and it's just suddenly like emerging behind my monitor and I'm like what the

828
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,200
 fuck is that? It's a little tiny lizard. Little tiny gecko. They move really fast

829
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,880
 and if you surprise them they drop their tails off and the tails keep moving and

830
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,800
 it's very freaky. Okay, that's quite freaky. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. So I tried to

831
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,080
 trap one and I thought I've gone under the box and I thought oh shit, I've chopped

832
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,720
 his tail off with the box. No, it had dropped its tail and left it but they

833
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,640
 continue moving. That is the freaky bit. I just got all this by googling after the

834
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:28,560
 fact. Yeah, you see really this is Octa thought the podcast of lizard tails and

835
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:34,360
 other digressions. Where's it gone? It's fucked off now is the problem. Oh, are we

836
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,560
 going to get our Arkham Horror playing session in the diary by the way chat? Yeah,

837
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:44,360
 probably. Should we do that after? I have some feedback from somebody which is you

838
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:49,440
 don't have this podcast is now over sound at the very end of the podcast, John.

839
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,120
 They don't. That's true. And you need it because if you are listening on a

840
00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:00,840
 podcast player that automatically plays the next episode, the after show leads

841
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,320
 seamlessly into the cold open and people don't realize they've started listening

842
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:10,320
 to the next episode until it's too late. Alright, how about I'm gonna do the this

843
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:22,000
 podcast is now over noise Liz prepare yourself. This podcast is now over. It's

844
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,960
 not often you get to see Allison just completely dumbfounded for what to say.

845
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:32,400
 So I am happy with that result. It isn't it isn't I was kind of thinking of doing

846
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:38,720
 like a little closing beat by blah blah blah. That's sort of that sort of end of

847
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:46,840
 okay yeah for enough you don't think me sexually saying this podcast is now over

848
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:53,200
 is what this podcast will self-destruct in five seconds. Yes, sorry that might be

849
00:58:53,200 --> 00:59:00,240
 that might be a cultural reference that is too old. I always worry. This podcast

850
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:06,040
 will end at the beep beep and then the beep yeah
