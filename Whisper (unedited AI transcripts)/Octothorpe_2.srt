1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 - Well, do follow up.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 We'll mention what Hogg said.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,760
 We'll say that Alison got lots of supportive comments

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,800
 that can't be printed, which sounds filthy.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
 (laughing)

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,120
 - It does, yes, but let's do an actual podcast

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,160
 no more than an hour, 'cause then I need to eat my dinner.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
 So.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,580
 (soft music)

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,560
 - Hello and welcome to episode two of Octa Thought,

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,080
 the podcast about science fiction.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,280
 I'm John Coxon.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,440
 - I'm Alison Scott.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
 - And I'm Liz Betty.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,360
 - We are riding on the heels

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,920
 of a phenomenally successful episode one.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,200
 We have had a letter of comments.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,480
 We've actually had a couple of comments.

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,120
 So Andrew Hogg criticized my metaphor choices.

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,920
 He said that sticking plasters over hurdles

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,040
 is not a thing that happens in athletics,

22
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,480
 but in my defense, I was always terrible at athletics.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,840
 So that may be why.

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,060
 - Alison, I believe you also got some comments.

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,260
 - I did, but they were all in a private members

26
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,060
 only mailing list, so I cannot repeat them here.

27
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,900
 - Yay.

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,740
 - But they were all very nice.

29
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,700
 Everyone was very impressed by the podcast

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,980
 and was like, do more of that.

31
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,560
 It's just what we need in these great times.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,380
 - We also had an email of comment from Murray Moore

33
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,900
 who told us all about what he's reading,

34
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,500
 A Sour Apple Tree by John Blackburn and Bunts,

35
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,860
 which is collected columns about baseball,

36
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,140
 which sounds very good if you like baseball.

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,300
 - But not science fiction.

38
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,220
 Not science fictional unless baseball

39
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,300
 is present in the future, which it may be.

40
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,140
 We don't know.

41
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,980
 We have not been there.

42
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,540
 He also mentioned that we haven't mentioned mailing lists

43
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,760
 in our discussion of virtual fandom last episode.

44
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,460
 So would either of you like to talk about mailing lists?

45
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,340
 - Well, I could talk a bit about fan history

46
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,060
 and say that virtual fandom is a bit of an old concept

47
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,740
 because fandom was always virtual.

48
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,260
 It started as a way for people to keep in touch

49
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,580
 with people all over the world

50
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,620
 who shared this same weird interest.

51
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,700
 What's happened here is that the rest of the world

52
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,620
 has caught up with the sort of things that fans do

53
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,780
 rather than fans necessarily changing what they do.

54
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,380
 So they're all over the world.

55
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,980
 They're a pocket of science fiction fans,

56
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,060
 keeping in touch in much the ways they always have done.

57
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,940
 And a lot of those ways are through emailing lists

58
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,660
 where somebody sends an email

59
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,540
 and sometimes later somebody else replies

60
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,420
 and confusion reigns.

61
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,900
 - Confusion does often reign.

62
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,180
 - Yes, well, I have a long-standing mailing list

63
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,340
 of me and some fan-ish friends.

64
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,060
 But actually what's happened is

65
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,700
 that the mailing list traffic has dwindled

66
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,900
 and being replaced with WhatsApp and Discord.

67
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,660
 And in fact, what happened is we keep starting up

68
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,420
 WhatsApp channels whenever we're at a convention

69
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,700
 in order to coordinate sensible things like eating

70
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,820
 and are there any more seats left in room two B

71
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,180
 for that interesting panel?

72
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,580
 And then we just keep it going

73
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,060
 because we kind of enjoy talking to each other.

74
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,540
 And in this time more than ever,

75
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,660
 so those are all sort of back we activate again

76
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,300
 and we also have Discord and so on as well.

77
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,220
 So the mailing list is actually dying a little bit,

78
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,620
 but I'm not sad because it's been replaced with other things.

79
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,900
 - Yeah, and I think I'm on various fan-ish mailing lists.

80
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,060
 There is a top secret mailing list full of fan fund winners

81
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,420
 and most of that is very good-natured.

82
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,380
 That has been a flurry of discussion

83
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,460
 in light of recent events,

84
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,100
 but we will get to that a bit later in the show.

85
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,740
 Liz mentioned Discord and there is also now a BSFA Discord.

86
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,340
 If you are a member of the British Science Fiction Association

87
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,340
 or if you are not,

88
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,860
 but you would like to talk to people who are,

89
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,060
 you can join their Discord

90
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,180
 and it's reasonably low traffic at the moment.

91
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,060
 I don't know what they're planning to do with it,

92
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,420
 but I will put a link in the show notes.

93
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,020
 Are you on a Discord, Alison?

94
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,820
 Have you been doing much Discording?

95
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,860
 - I have not been doing much Discording,

96
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,460
 but I am on many Discord.

97
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,540
 So what I find with Discord is that

98
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,020
 I'll be doing something, some activity

99
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,420
 and a Discord will pop up around that.

100
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,980
 And for a while we will have a flurry in activity

101
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,100
 and it will be very useful,

102
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,260
 but I'm not using Discord at the moment

103
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,740
 for any part of my social life, I don't think.

104
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,140
 I do use Slack a bit

105
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,820
 when we're talking about things like that

106
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,100
 for a group of people who I work with.

107
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,220
 So it's not necessarily a science fiction or thing at all.

108
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,540
 In fact, not, but that's only a social space,

109
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,540
 not really a work space.

110
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,500
 We talk about things like how to make money,

111
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,340
 which at the moment is, yeah, don't.

112
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,020
 - Yeah, we have a Discord and we have morning tea

113
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,380
 or afternoon tea for people in the wrong time zones

114
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,060
 every morning and that's really nice.

115
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,900
 And for me, Slack is mostly a workplace,

116
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,380
 so I don't usually check that outside the work day.

117
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,060
 How are you finding Discord?

118
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,780
 So you, a member of lots of Discords are only a couple.

119
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,580
 - I remember only one Discord

120
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,180
 because I think I'd previously assumed

121
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,860
 it was sort of for gaming mostly,

122
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,100
 but actually it's just like IRC,

123
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,220
 which was a key part of my social life

124
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,980
 in the pre-discord times,

125
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,660
 except as much easier to spontaneously

126
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,420
 have voice conversations with people.

127
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,660
 So I'm really enjoying it, yeah.

128
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,380
 And I use Slack only for work.

129
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,900
 So it's nice to keep that division of Slack is for work.

130
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,700
 Discord is for non-work situation.

131
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,340
 - Yeah, I think Discord and Slack

132
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,620
 are very similar in some ways.

133
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,100
 Discord started as a way of letting gamers do voice chat

134
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,140
 and has kind of grown beyond that.

135
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,020
 And Slack started as a way to let work colleagues

136
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,140
 talk to each other in serious text conversations

137
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,500
 and has grown beyond that.

138
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,340
 And they have kind of slowly been moving towards the middle

139
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,620
 from opposite directions,

140
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,300
 which has been quite interesting to watch.

141
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,860
 - The other big technology that has been used quite a lot

142
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,060
 recently is Zoom.

143
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,060
 So Alison, you have ran a first Thursday pub meeting on Zoom.

144
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,660
 And I was curious to see what your thoughts about that were

145
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,700
 and how it went.

146
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,300
 - I think I should start by saying

147
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,340
 there are a great many video conferencing options

148
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,740
 and Zoom has emerged, I think pretty well everywhere

149
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,060
 as having probably the best combination of ease of use

150
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,620
 and ability to deliver quality audio and video

151
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,300
 over quite small brand width in a lot of cases

152
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,660
 for quite a lot of people.

153
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,700
 So it's just got the sweet spot of the package.

154
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,580
 I looked at, I wanted to run a virtual first Thursday meeting

155
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,380
 for people who don't know that London fans

156
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
 have been meeting on the first Thursday of the month

157
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,260
 ever since 1946 in a variety of London pubs.

158
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,420
 And we couldn't do it this month.

159
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,780
 And so I thought it would be good to have a virtual thing.

160
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,580
 And the people in the first Thursday Facebook group

161
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,940
 thought that it would be quite a good thing.

162
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,260
 So I set about exhaustively testing

163
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,900
 every video conference a solution available,

164
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,780
 try and find one that would help us do that.

165
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,300
 And what I didn't want was something where the 50 or so people

166
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
 who might turn up on a Thursday night

167
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,420
 would all cram into one video conferencing space

168
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,740
 and have it go, oh well, I can't have 50 people

169
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,660
 all talking at once.

170
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,900
 If you actually go to a real pub, you go and sit at tables.

171
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,220
 And what happens at the first Thursday

172
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,380
 is that people mostly go and sit at the same table

173
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,220
 every time.

174
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,780
 So there'll be a table that mostly has zed zed

175
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,740
 and dyed people on it.

176
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,540
 And there'll be a table that mostly has old farts on it.

177
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,420
 And there'll be a table for people

178
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
 who want to talk seriously about science fiction.

179
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,020
 There'll be a table for people who want to smough the Eastergum.

180
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,260
 And what we were trying to do was recreate some sense of that

181
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,100
 in the zoo by using Zoom's breakout rooms

182
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,780
 to essentially act as these tables.

183
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,620
 And it turns out that video conferencing for business,

184
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,940
 they don't think that people are going to want to move around

185
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,020
 between the breakout rooms regularly

186
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,020
 or dash away from their breakout room

187
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,940
 because somebody started to be boring and nip off for a smoke.

188
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,180
 Though actually I've been at work conferences

189
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,340
 where that has been the case.

190
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,540
 So it turned out to be quite complicated to set up

191
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,780
 and I did it by getting a paid Zoom account,

192
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,740
 making everyone in the meeting co-hosts.

193
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,580
 And then after that,

194
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,540
 they could move themselves around but to do these rooms.

195
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,980
 We had no password.

196
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,420
 Our security strategy was,

197
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,180
 if anyone tries to do anything naughty, we'd boot them,

198
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,500
 which is not the most elaborate security strategy.

199
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,420
 And it worked fantastically and everyone had a lot of fun

200
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,380
 and we had about 40 people or so

201
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,300
 and we had a really good evening,

202
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,900
 except mostly my fun was mostly the fun of sorting it all out,

203
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,220
 which so it felt more like con-running type fun

204
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,660
 rather than sitting around in a pub type fun.

205
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,980
 But I have been having a lot of sitting around

206
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,900
 in the pub type fun on many video conferencing services.

207
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,700
 So I don't want to suggest that I'd be missing out on that.

208
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,260
 The only thing I've missed out on is that the hangovers really

209
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,980
 and tried to get back from London and the tube

210
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,220
 at two o'clock in the morning,

211
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,060
 having not entirely worked out what I was doing.

212
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,300
 I've missed that.

213
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,900
 There's no reason you couldn't recreate the hangover experience

214
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,340
 in the comfort of your own home.

215
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,300
 It turns out that there's a,

216
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,260
 the amount I want to drink on Zoom

217
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,420
 seems to be lower than the amount I want to drink in the pub,

218
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,220
 which is quite good really.

219
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,100
 I mean, we do have beer and it's quite nice

220
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,420
 and we've been buying beer from local breweries

221
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,260
 and that's good.

222
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,260
 It's not quite such a drinking experience.

223
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,780
 The beer is vastly better.

224
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,820
 We had two notable groups of spies on our chat.

225
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,740
 The first was the Yom's Vikings, trying to work out

226
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,100
 whether this would be effective for a virtual Yom's thing,

227
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,540
 which is a book discussion where traditionally

228
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,780
 one person holds the speaking object

229
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,500
 and speaks at any time.

230
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,620
 And the first Thursday group,

231
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,420
 the Vanguard group in Seattle turned up

232
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,540
 to see whether they thought they would be able to run

233
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,700
 a Seattle meeting using the same technology.

234
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,620
 So it's kind of spreading.

235
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,140
 - And I think it's worth noting that the Toronto Faddo

236
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,700
 also has a first Thursday meeting,

237
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,980
 which I think started because people from London

238
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,140
 went over to Toronto and introduced it.

239
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,820
 So I think it is not an accident that is the same day.

240
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,500
 But it's kind of nice to think that there are fans

241
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,620
 all over the world who meet on a first Thursday.

242
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,300
 One of the reasons I didn't come to the first Thursday

243
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,100
 is 'cause I don't usually come to the first Thursday

244
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,140
 and I thought going along, if everyone who doesn't usually go

245
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,460
 had clicked on the button, I was a bit worried

246
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,420
 it would get overwhelmed.

247
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,980
 So I did not go.

248
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,660
 - In practice, it was fine.

249
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,460
 But also one of the things that happened on Thursday

250
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,220
 was that we got some people who have been to the first Thursday

251
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,740
 from time to time, but because they live in Australia

252
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,260
 or Canada or Seattle or wherever,

253
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,260
 do not habitually get to it.

254
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,340
 And in that included at least one regular

255
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,740
 who's just moved to New Zealand.

256
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,380
 So obviously it was very nice to see them.

257
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,300
 The other group of people who got there

258
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,340
 were people who would love to go to the first Thursday

259
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,180
 and who are London fans,

260
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,020
 but who can't manage the stairs up to that back room.

261
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,940
 And so any fans who can't manage stairs,

262
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,780
 this is actually enabling for them.

263
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,900
 - Do you think you will do it again next month?

264
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,940
 - Yeah, well, we'll certainly have some form

265
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,620
 of virtual meeting every month

266
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,980
 that the pubs are closed, certainly.

267
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,340
 - Technically speaking, I believe as we record

268
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,060
 that it is two weeks away from the government's proposed

269
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,940
 see whether everything has gotten better

270
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,100
 and we can relax the restrictions, deadline.

271
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,860
 - Yeah, would you like to make a small bet?

272
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,140
 - I mean, given how much things changed

273
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,180
 in between us recording and the episode going out last week,

274
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,620
 I'm very hesitant, but yeah, propose your battleism.

275
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,060
 We'll see, we'll see.

276
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,020
 - I bet it won't have.

277
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,220
 I do not think that the pubs will be open

278
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,580
 for some considerable time.

279
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,460
 - I think you might be right about that.

280
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,660
 - Certainly not May, probably not June.

281
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,020
 Let's hope on July.

282
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,740
 - Well, I think we might get quicker

283
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,380
 than that is small gatherings.

284
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,700
 - Yes, well, yes, maybe.

285
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,540
 I don't know.

286
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,100
 Liz, you're an expert.

287
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,180
 - Yes, but there are also lots of other experts

288
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,740
 who are more expert than me who've given their opinion on this.

289
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,980
 So I will cowardly defer to them.

290
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,500
 But also I think when they release the restrictions a bit,

291
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,460
 people are going to stay local.

292
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,300
 So I think like gatherings where you go and see someone

293
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,580
 nearby that you can walk to, maybe things that are

294
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,100
 regained earlier than ones where you have to go

295
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,140
 and get on public transport and go to a pub

296
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,980
 on the other side of London.

297
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,500
 So I think it's all going to kind of go in, in waves perhaps.

298
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,460
 But it's also, I don't know if they've reopened

299
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,460
 sort of restaurants and bars and things in Shanghai

300
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,420
 and Wuhan yet.

301
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,900
 So that might be an interesting path to look at.

302
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,220
 - My understanding is that restaurants and bars

303
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,300
 are open in China with some restrictions,

304
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,180
 but the cinemas and theatres have not reopened.

305
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,860
 They tried to reopen them and then change their minds

306
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,940
 particularly, but again, I'm not being following

307
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,780
 this in great detail.

308
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,580
 So I might just be totally wrong about that.

309
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,300
 - I would like to urge our listeners not to take

310
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,620
 medical advice from us.

311
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,700
 Please look at what the NHS and the government are saying.

312
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,180
 We are, but people discussing interesting things.

313
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,780
 - What I would say that science fiction all about this

314
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,740
 is that if I ever read a science fiction book again,

315
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,740
 where society has dramatically changed in the way

316
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,220
 that personal interactions work or work works

317
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,620
 or things of that kind, unless it gives me a trigger event

318
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,620
 for that change to have happened,

319
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,980
 I'm just going to say no, no, no,

320
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,180
 these things don't happen by gradual change.

321
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,340
 It turns out that they are in fact triggered by event.

322
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,900
 And what we have seen here is a big old trigger event.

323
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,100
 Lots of old people are now doing video chats

324
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,060
 because we had a trigger event.

325
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,260
 - Yeah, I mean, my grandmother has worked out how to text

326
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,740
 which may be the first time that she has successfully done that.

327
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,220
 And my parents were already relatively comfortable

328
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,620
 with video chatting, so that is not a huge change.

329
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,900
 But yeah, I've noticed some changes in behavior.

330
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,660
 - I think many people were already comfortable with it

331
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,380
 just because of the globalised nature of things

332
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,740
 before the trigger event, as to put it.

333
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,180
 There are a lot of parents and grandparents

334
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,660
 who are not necessarily living in the same country

335
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,060
 as their children, their grandchildren,

336
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,140
 and they have all learned how to video chat

337
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,100
 so they don't miss the important life event.

338
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,500
 - Yeah, there are lots of disabled people

339
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,180
 who have been asking for the ability to work from home

340
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,580
 for many, many years and have been told,

341
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,660
 "No, we could not possibly do your very important work from home."

342
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,700
 And they have been very angry

343
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,260
 that the world has suddenly worked out

344
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,980
 that a vast majority of jobs can in fact be done from home

345
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,060
 perfectly well.

346
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,340
 - Again, it's trigger events, like you're saying.

347
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,700
 As much as I think the impetus should have been there earlier

348
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,260
 for accessibility reasons, you're right that this is the big push

349
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,140
 that people needed to make that actually work.

350
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,660
 Last episode, we used to just cancel

351
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,820
 and we were discussing the reasons why that might be.

352
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,260
 We haven't yet gone into lockdown in the UK.

353
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,820
 In the intervening three days, we did in fact

354
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,540
 get a lot closer to lockdown.

355
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,300
 We were advised to shelter in place

356
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,460
 and hotels were advised to shut by the government.

357
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,900
 So, Eastacom would have been canceled either way.

358
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,180
 It's amazing how much things changed in three days.

359
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,460
 In the couple of weeks since the last episode,

360
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,740
 Conzeland have announced that they are also not running

361
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,660
 as we predicted last episode

362
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,980
 and are going to do a virtual convention.

363
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,300
 So how do we feel about the idea

364
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,660
 of a virtual world con?

365
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,620
 - That is one of the issues here,

366
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,780
 which is when I pay for a world con,

367
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,780
 which is a reasonably expensive proposition

368
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,220
 just for the membership.

369
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,260
 I'm paying for physical, tangible things,

370
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,420
 like because I know that my money is going towards

371
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,660
 essentially the rental of a large expensive venue

372
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,620
 and all the associated costs with that.

373
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,820
 And when you get to a virtual con,

374
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,620
 apart from the costs of managing to host it,

375
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,260
 which will be probably considerable,

376
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,860
 but nothing like as much as hosting a physical venue,

377
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,620
 a lot of the work that will go into it

378
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,500
 is the work that people were already doing

379
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,220
 as volunteers for the world con.

380
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,820
 So I think it's going to be very difficult

381
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
 to try and get a pricing structure that will work.

382
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,860
 As for refunds, I don't know how much money

383
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,500
 has already been spent and cannot be recouped.

384
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,820
 So I can see why they might not be doing refunds,

385
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,420
 but I'd be very interested to see

386
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,220
 where they pitch the rate for new memberships.

387
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,820
 - They have said that they are going to refund

388
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,260
 the difference between attending and online memberships

389
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,620
 when the price for online membership goes live,

390
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,820
 which I think at the time of recording

391
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
 is supposed to be the 15th of April.

392
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,220
 - I am not persuaded yet of the value proposition

393
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,260
 of an online world con.

394
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,100
 I think that this is a very hard task to manage.

395
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,020
 We manage our existing world cons

396
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,820
 by having a lot of extremely talented volunteers

397
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,860
 who work in areas they always work in,

398
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,380
 know how to do those things and make them work.

399
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,700
 An example of the sorts of difficulties here

400
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,820
 are that a friend of mine having listened to our podcast said,

401
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,380
 well, that would be a great model for the world con.

402
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,980
 You could record a panel and then do it like that.

403
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,940
 And I was like, but John will have put in many hours of editing.

404
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,180
 I mean, a thousand hours maybe?

405
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,580
 I don't know, many hours of editing on OctaThorp1.

406
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,420
 And there's no way that's going to happen

407
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,860
 for the hundreds or thousands of panels

408
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,140
 that you have to work on.

409
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,540
 You know, that volunteer resource just isn't there.

410
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,380
 - I was thinking about this.

411
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,700
 I mean, I think it could work.

412
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,380
 You'd have to treat every panel

413
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,300
 as a sort of Zoom style breakout room

414
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,420
 where only your panelists are on video and audio

415
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,700
 and everyone else is forcibly muted.

416
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,500
 And then at the end, you let them selectively

417
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,820
 unmute themselves to ask questions.

418
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,980
 But you need the person who is normally sitting

419
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,860
 at the back of the room fiddling with the levels

420
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,820
 on the microphones to be the person who is in that room,

421
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,860
 like enforcing that with an iron fist fit to work at all.

422
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,700
 - At the last EasterCon, they had a model

423
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,660
 where they passed a book around the audience

424
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,780
 and people wrote questions in it

425
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,500
 that they wanted to ask John Scalzi

426
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,900
 who was the guest of honor.

427
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,220
 And at the end, they chose questions

428
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,660
 from the book and read them.

429
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,340
 And I think that had two very big advantages.

430
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,020
 It meant that the person who was doing the interview

431
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,580
 could scan through and find the next interesting question

432
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,540
 while John was answering the previous one.

433
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,260
 And it also meant the person scanning through

434
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,740
 could look for sentences that had question marks

435
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,020
 at the end, which completely brought to an end.

436
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,380
 This is more of a comment than a question phenomenon,

437
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,900
 which I don't know about YouTube,

438
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,060
 but it is my firm opinion, can die and go in the sea.

439
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,900
 I don't know if you think that would translate well,

440
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,460
 but that's how I would do it if I was going to,

441
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,620
 which of course I am not.

442
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,220
 - Unlike running a virtual pub meeting,

443
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,420
 this is a problem which is very well established

444
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,740
 in professional video conferencing uses,

445
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,420
 and they do both of those models.

446
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,540
 So it's normal for professional video conferencing,

447
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,420
 setups to have a number of people who are allowed to speak

448
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,540
 and everybody else be auto-muted.

449
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,060
 And then I've seen both of those other ways work.

450
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,940
 Either you have a text chat that everybody has access to

451
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,820
 and people type things in it,

452
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,140
 or you have a text chat that everybody has access to,

453
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,860
 but only the moderators can read

454
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,020
 so they could be reading what's coming in on it,

455
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,620
 or you can have a thing where people just click a button

456
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,860
 if they want to speak,

457
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,940
 and then those people are called on internal.

458
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,620
 I've seen all of those systems work.

459
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,340
 I've seen the system work where people type their question,

460
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,060
 but then the moderator calls all that person to speak.

461
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,740
 And so all of those things are fine.

462
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,420
 As well as the moderator who's allegedly

463
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,980
 the moderator of the panel,

464
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
 you almost certainly need two more people.

465
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,580
 One managing the audio for the panel

466
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,940
 in the way that the tech person at the back of the room would,

467
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,460
 and one actually managing that text chat

468
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,020
 and making sure that any actual bad actors are booted.

469
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,340
 So I think it's interesting because the problem is

470
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,820
 that the panels are only one part of the experience,

471
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,180
 and I cannot see myself sitting at my laptop

472
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,060
 for four or six hours a day watching online panels

473
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,140
 in the way that at Worldcon

474
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,380
 I would actually physically go to those panels.

475
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,540
 So I think we've got to take that into account.

476
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,380
 I think you're right.

477
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,580
 And I think that's one of the things I want to bring up,

478
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,740
 which was a criticism I saw on various mailing lists

479
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,060
 I'm a member of, which is a real division

480
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,780
 between people who wondered to what extent it was not worth

481
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,100
 having a virtual Worldcon,

482
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,020
 because the social aspect of the Worldcon

483
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,620
 is really the primary motivator for them.

484
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,700
 And to what extent it's worth putting on a Worldcon,

485
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,420
 because obviously having something is better than nothing.

486
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,220
 And it's not like there's a mystical option

487
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,780
 where we just have the Worldcon anyway,

488
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,060
 and we all get exactly what we want.

489
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,140
 So it really is a choice between having nothing at all

490
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,340
 or having some online offering.

491
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,780
 I don't think I would pay as much as I would pay

492
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,300
 for a normal attending membership

493
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,540
 in order to attend a virtual convention.

494
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,660
 But equally, I can see an argument

495
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,780
 that it's better to have something on

496
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,620
 rather than just completely abandoning it.

497
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,180
 - If they run a virtual con,

498
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,140
 at what time are they going to do it?

499
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,220
 - That's a really good question,

500
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,580
 because you don't want to isolate,

501
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,420
 you don't want to exclude the local fandom,

502
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,820
 but you equally don't want to exclude the US fandom.

503
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,060
 I don't know this for sure,

504
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,180
 I haven't looked at the membership numbers,

505
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,780
 but I strongly suspect the US contingent

506
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,980
 was the biggest contingent.

507
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,940
 It usually is at any given Worldcon.

508
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,020
 And so it's a very, very good question.

509
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,620
 - I think in some ways it's not the US,

510
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,460
 which is a problem.

511
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,580
 So I'm just looking at the Hugo finalist announcement,

512
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,540
 which will be on the seventh or the eighth,

513
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,020
 depending on your time zone.

514
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,780
 And it's starting at 8 a.m. New Zealand time,

515
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,340
 which is 9 p.m. in the UK, 4 p.m. on the East Coast

516
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,940
 and 1 p.m. on the West Coast.

517
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,260
 So you can actually manage to find a time

518
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,220
 when I think New Zealand and the US are awake,

519
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,020
 but you cannot find a time when New Zealand

520
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,980
 and the US and Europe are awake.

521
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,140
 And those in between New Zealand and Europe,

522
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,020
 I think will just stand up, give it up,

523
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,220
 'cause I'm not sure there'll be any time

524
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,060
 that suits everyone.

525
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,620
 - Somebody has told me that as a result

526
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,940
 of everybody's lockdown,

527
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,980
 we now have two time zones globally,

528
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,940
 which are coffee and beer.

529
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,380
 (laughs)

530
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,460
 - Yes, I've heard that too.

531
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,220
 And it's worryingly true.

532
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,260
 - So you're either in coffee time or beer time.

533
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,780
 - Yes, that is, I think, a very good point.

534
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,020
 I think that is a very good question

535
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,300
 of how they're gonna do it.

536
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,900
 My guess would be that it will be bad for Europe

537
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,780
 and I will not get to attend much of it.

538
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,180
 But then again, I was not planning to go to New Zealand

539
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,540
 and would not have attended a bunch of it anyway.

540
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,900
 So perhaps I am not the person they need to be prioritizing.

541
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,740
 - So now I can say something temperate about Guff,

542
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,060
 which is that they haven't,

543
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,500
 the Guff races due to end next week.

544
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,340
 And I was gonna do a big push on,

545
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,500
 the Guff races due to end,

546
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,100
 please everybody vote for me,

547
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
 though I can't say that

548
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,860
 because I wouldn't dream of being the campaigning type.

549
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,980
 But they haven't really said what they're doing.

550
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,580
 They've indicated privately that the plan is

551
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,380
 that the winner will attend the convention virtually

552
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,340
 and take their trip at a later date,

553
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,300
 which seems completely fine to me

554
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,620
 and I would have thought would be fine

555
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,340
 to lots of other people as well.

556
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,420
 But it raises that question.

557
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,860
 I mean, I'm very happy to attend the convention virtually

558
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,900
 in those circumstances,

559
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,660
 but I certainly wouldn't be able to attend

560
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
 in the same way that I would in person.

561
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,780
 And it would mean me almost certainly going on tonight's shift

562
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,820
 for a week in order to make it work.

563
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,180
 And that's kind of slightly weird.

564
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,500
 I mean, it's not impossible, but it's slightly weird.

565
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,580
 - Obviously, you're in a position where you miss out

566
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,580
 on Conziland being the destination World Cup,

567
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,060
 which we touched on last episode is a great shame.

568
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,100
 I think that rearranging the race for a future time

569
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,740
 and having the delegate get enthusiastically virtually

570
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,220
 involved is the best solution.

571
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,740
 But it is a solution that does have a lot of logistical

572
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,460
 questions, as you say, and I'm not sure what the answer

573
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,420
 to any of that is.

574
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,780
 I am very glad that I am not the administrator

575
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,340
 of a fan fund at this time,

576
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,260
 because it must be a nightmare for the administrator

577
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,460
 to decide what to do.

578
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,620
 - But I would like them to decide what to do

579
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,900
 because there are sometimes when it's appropriate

580
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,300
 to take a decision.

581
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,620
 And I think this is an announcement in time for the race

582
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,340
 to either be canceled or to finish.

583
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,380
 - I suspect the race will not be canceled

584
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,140
 because I suspect they will want there to be a delegate

585
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,900
 for the virtual convention that occurs,

586
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,500
 because not having Duff and Guff candidates

587
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,860
 when there is a Australasian World Cup would be a great shame.

588
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,340
 And doing it this way means you can at least have some

589
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,260
 fan fund candidate involvement in the World Cup

590
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,420
 even if it is virtual.

591
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,780
 Maybe they'll listen to this and write us a letter.

592
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,300
 - Yeah, they don't have a lot of time.

593
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,820
 (laughing)

594
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,500
 - You get a little bit of time.

595
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,620
 - I'll do a faster editing job, it will be fine.

596
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,180
 - So the Duff winner has been announced already,

597
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,340
 which is Erin Underwood, it's a great choice

598
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,100
 for anyone who hasn't heard.

599
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,540
 - Fantastic choice.

600
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,380
 - Yes.

601
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,060
 - And it doesn't say anything about Erin going to Conziland.

602
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,260
 It just says that she will try and travel in 2021.

603
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,180
 But I assume that is also the goal.

604
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,980
 - I submitted my bond and a guarantee

605
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,620
 that I would attend the convention if I won.

606
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,420
 (laughing)

607
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,980
 And travel, it's really weird.

608
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,020
 And then of course when all this kicked off,

609
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,940
 I went, oh, that's interesting isn't it?

610
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,060
 - So you have guaranteed that if you win,

611
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,740
 you will stay up all night

612
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,340
 virtually attending Conziland.

613
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,380
 - Yeah, definitely.

614
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,220
 Yeah.

615
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,460
 Like I wasn't gonna do that anyway.

616
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,340
 These two corners announced that they're going to run

617
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,900
 the bidding session for 2021 and 2022.

618
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,260
 I was going to be the fangest at concentric,

619
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,580
 so I'm gonna be holding a Zoom party.

620
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,420
 I don't know if I should say this.

621
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,820
 People who are interested in this

622
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,340
 should get in touch with me.

623
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,100
 If I know you, I'll give you the details.

624
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,380
 It's not gonna be super secret.

625
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,140
 Because if I was at the convention being fangest of honor,

626
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,940
 then one of the things I would do is hold a definitely,

627
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,700
 definitely not official room party.

628
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,540
 - I think that's a good one.

629
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,340
 - And I think you'll find that other people

630
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,980
 who might have done things at EasterCon

631
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,300
 will be doing those things over next weekend.

632
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,460
 But this otherwise, what are we gonna do?

633
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,100
 Like, I don't know, what do people do at Easter?

634
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,780
 Is that not at the EasterCon?

635
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,100
 - This is a hashtag privilege problems.

636
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,420
 But because I am an academic,

637
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,180
 I get two extra days off around the Easter weekend.

638
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,660
 So I've got six days of not having anything to do.

639
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,180
 And it's just, oh, it's gonna be tricky

640
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,500
 with how EasterCon there to kind of fill up with stuff.

641
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,300
 I think doing a Zoom thing or something

642
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,500
 is a really good idea.

643
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,260
 And I also think that having it so that it's only people

644
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,180
 who would have been there anyway is a good idea too.

645
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,380
 I really don't want to suggest that only people

646
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,860
 who go to the EasterCon could come to my party.

647
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,700
 But I think I am going to suggest that only people

648
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,100
 who know me can come to my party.

649
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,860
 I don't think that's unreasonable.

650
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,620
 - That's good, 'cause then I can come to your party.

651
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,180
 So I approve.

652
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,660
 - You definitely can come to my party.

653
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,820
 Yes, you two are both invited.

654
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,100
 - Liz, you would fall under both criteria

655
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,820
 because you currently have an EasterCon attending membership.

656
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,700
 - I do, but that's because it got to the point

657
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,500
 where I was trying to sell it

658
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,780
 and then I realized it was going to be canceled.

659
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,980
 And I felt that I was selling someone a membership

660
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,220
 but then they would be on the hook.

661
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,100
 - How many hours ahead of us are you, Liz?

662
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,620
 - So this is the problem.

663
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,700
 I am currently six hours ahead of you,

664
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,220
 which means while I would very much like to come to your party,

665
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,820
 it will be like the early hours of the morning for me.

666
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,140
 It will be the early hours of the morning.

667
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,180
 I mean, I suspect that the drinks of the party

668
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,700
 will just be as you're getting up.

669
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,380
 - It's that time that I cannot get to

670
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,180
 from either end, basically.

671
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,420
 I cannot stay up late enough, I get up early enough.

672
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,460
 - As yet, the only thing the EasterCon committee

673
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,220
 have announced they are doing over the Easter weekend

674
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,820
 virtually is the bid session,

675
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,220
 which probably means that there's not going

676
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,900
 to be much programming happening.

677
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,500
 So to what extent do you think British fandom

678
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,740
 are going to do any programming sort of as a grassroots effort?

679
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,540
 Do you think that there will be lots of room parties popping up?

680
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,020
 Or do you think that it will be very ad hoc

681
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,700
 and we'll see Facebook posts at the time?

682
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,460
 - I mean, I've announced I'm doing something but I,

683
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,300
 and part of why I did that was to encourage the others.

684
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,340
 So I'm doing a thing and there's a bit of accession

685
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,300
 that I was trying to hope by saying,

686
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,820
 "I'm doing a thing," then we might see some virtual book launches

687
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,620
 or virtual author readings or things of that kind

688
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,820
 because I think that would be quite fun.

689
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,380
 - There's a lot of virtual author readings going on right now.

690
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,620
 Anyway, I see quite a lot of them pop up on Twitter and Facebook.

691
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,020
 But I wonder if part of it is also that the committee

692
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,220
 have been understandably quiet,

693
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,700
 but if I was organizing things,

694
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,340
 I might not want to jump in enthusiastically

695
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,140
 in case they were still planning something.

696
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,860
 And as it gets later and later,

697
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,380
 then becomes even less likely that anyone will jump in

698
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,340
 enthusiastically.

699
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,380
 So that might be part of it.

700
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,660
 - Last week, we talked about giving the Quitty Space

701
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,660
 and letting them work out what they wanted to do

702
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,300
 and not having a big discussion either way.

703
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,420
 But now, given that it's a week until Easter,

704
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,060
 as we record, if they were planning to do something,

705
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,620
 I think they would have announced it at this point.

706
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,580
 And I think that it's completely legit that they don't want to

707
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,500
 because I think it is a very different thing.

708
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,540
 And they must be completely gutted

709
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,380
 that they can't run the convention they were planning.

710
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,300
 But I think at this point, it may be time

711
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,620
 to start trying to get the ball rolling

712
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,020
 on organizing some grassroots stuff.

713
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,460
 And I think Alison's impetus to do that is a good one.

714
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,020
 And I've got some ideas about things we could do.

715
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,060
 We could do a live podcast recording.

716
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,460
 - It's only been a week.

717
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,940
 Would it be okay to have a third octave thought?

718
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
 - Yeah, why not?

719
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,780
 - In only a week after the second.

720
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,500
 We don't give the impression this is going to become a habit.

721
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,820
 (laughs)

722
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,660
 - No, we could do.

723
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,940
 We could have an octave thought Zoom party.

724
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,220
 That could work exclusive.

725
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,460
 We each get two plus ones or one plus two,

726
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,740
 depending on how that works.

727
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,340
 I'm hoping that there will be stuff happening next weekend.

728
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,380
 There was something that happened this weekend.

729
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,900
 Yesterday was Wi-Fi sci-fi.

730
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,500
 Did either of you hear about Wi-Fi sci-fi?

731
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,380
 - I did not.

732
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,340
 Tell me about Wi-Fi sci-fi John.

733
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,260
 - So I saw this on Glen Morgan's Twitter feed.

734
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,940
 I saw it after it had happened

735
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,740
 because that is how all the best parties get heard about.

736
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,580
 You hear about them after they've finished.

737
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,580
 But it was a Zoom convention which starred various luminaries.

738
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,460
 It had Gareth Powell, Ezra Walker, Michael Carey,

739
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,900
 Tarda Thompson, Ann Corlott, Patrick Edwards,

740
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,060
 Jonathan Piddock, Allie DeBodard, Kim, Lake and Smith,

741
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,460
 Michael Rowley, Kevin Henny, Anna Chapman, Dave Hutchinson,

742
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,420
 Derek Kuntzken and Premier Mohammed.

743
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,500
 But it had two paddles.

744
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,660
 It had cafe clutches and it had a quiz.

745
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,220
 And it, I believe the two panels are on YouTube

746
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,340
 for people who couldn't make it to the Zoom

747
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,780
 because the Zoom was 90 people

748
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,460
 and there were more than 90 people interested.

749
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,420
 I believe you can go and watch both of those on YouTube.

750
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,980
 It looked like it was quite good.

751
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,620
 The tweets I saw about it seemed to be people

752
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,580
 having a good time.

753
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,460
 I'm a little bit annoyed.

754
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,540
 I didn't hear about it when it was happening

755
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,180
 as opposed to hearing about it the day after.

756
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,460
 But I think that's often the way with a convention

757
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,940
 you see people tweeting while they were at the convention

758
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,300
 and you did not see the marketing

759
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,900
 push leading up to the convention,

760
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,860
 which is distressingly common.

761
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,780
 But it sounds like a really good idea.

762
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,660
 I think two panels for a one day convention

763
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,620
 virtually is probably about the right number

764
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,140
 'cause I think Liz's point about

765
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,060
 not being able to sit for six hours in panels

766
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,580
 is probably right.

767
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,700
 I think something like that next weekend,

768
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700
 if anyone puts it together,

769
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,740
 I would enthusiastically get involved with.

770
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,380
 - It is interesting that I think everyone you listed

771
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,140
 who was on those panels was a science fiction author.

772
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,100
 One of the things I do like about EasterCon

773
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,980
 is it tends to have fans and scientists

774
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,980
 and historians and people with non-writing expertise

775
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,540
 on the panel as well.

776
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,300
 So it'd be nice if we could put together something

777
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,180
 that included all of those people.

778
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,020
 - I agree.

779
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,220
 - I'd obviously agree with that.

780
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,100
 - We've been talking a lot about video conferencing software

781
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,660
 and I think that a lot has been done over the last few weeks

782
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,020
 to really advance fandom's engagement with these tools.

783
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,100
 Zoom has come under fire over the last week or so

784
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,220
 for various bits of bad practice to do with privacy.

785
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,700
 I don't want to give the impression here

786
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,660
 that I don't think people should use Zoom.

787
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,980
 Zoom is an incredible piece of software

788
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,140
 that's really helping people keep their mental health

789
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,260
 and their communication lines open at the moment.

790
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,940
 And I think that is fantastic.

791
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,100
 I do think it's worth being aware

792
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,020
 of some of Zoom's potential pitfalls

793
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,140
 and protecting yourself against them

794
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,700
 if it's something you mind.

795
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,180
 And if it's not something you mind, obviously go wild.

796
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,740
 But recently there have been a few bits of controversy,

797
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,900
 notably they had some Facebook data

798
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,060
 in their iOS app that was sending data back to Facebook.

799
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,140
 They had said that their chats were end to end encrypted

800
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,580
 but it turned out that their encryption is not end to end

801
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,820
 and is in fact based on a slightly different encryption method

802
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,940
 to the method that they had said they used.

803
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,460
 Their Mac OS installer abuses pre-install scripts

804
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,220
 to install itself without letting you see

805
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,620
 what's it going to install.

806
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,100
 And a few months ago, I think actually maybe a year ago,

807
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,220
 they had installed a local web server

808
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,820
 on every Mac they installed on

809
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,580
 which let them reinstall their app even

810
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,060
 after you've done installed it.

811
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,780
 It is worth saying that they have published a blog post

812
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,500
 in the last few days that outline a 90 day plan

813
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,260
 to address a lot of these privacy concerns

814
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,380
 and that they are working very hard to address them.

815
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,100
 And I appreciate those points got more and more technical

816
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,460
 and less and less understandable as time goes on.

817
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,540
 I will put links in the show notes.

818
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,780
 And as I say, I want to emphasize that I am advising

819
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,180
 people be careful rather than stop using it altogether.

820
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,540
 But both of you, to what extent do you think

821
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,700
 this is a thing we need to be super concerned about

822
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,260
 and to what extent do you think that this is something

823
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,100
 that we just need to be mindful of?

824
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,740
 - I think that a lot of the people who are making

825
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,740
 the most noise about Zoom use either A, Facebook or B,

826
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,540
 emailing lists, both of which are notably less secure

827
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,580
 than Zoom.

828
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,620
 So they started, they assumed they're clearly a bunch

829
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,420
 of wide boys, honestly.

830
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,620
 They started this company, they made a good product,

831
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,300
 they did not care about privacy,

832
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,940
 they clearly failed in three different areas.

833
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,820
 The first is that they have a load of kind of corporate

834
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,020
 spying stuff so that your boss can spy on you,

835
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,580
 which is I think fairly normal for corporate software.

836
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,820
 They didn't care in the sense that other people's

837
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,140
 security things, they just kind of worked around

838
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,340
 if that way they got to make a better product.

839
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,580
 So they basically went, ah-ha, can we make a better product

840
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,180
 by entering operating systems by the back door?

841
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,740
 Yes, we can, we should do that.

842
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,860
 And the third is they left great gaping holes

843
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,220
 in their security accidentally

844
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,860
 while they were busy trying to make a better product.

845
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,540
 They ended up with a better product

846
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,140
 and now they're going, okay, so clearly everyone's

847
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,660
 using our product 'cause it's better,

848
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,740
 we should probably go back and fix those holes

849
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,740
 we left in it, which I think is fair.

850
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,020
 It's not the best way to behave, but it is better.

851
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,140
 It is noticeably better for any video chat over eight people

852
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,060
 and it's probably better for most of the ones under that,

853
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,860
 except possibly Microsoft's E.

854
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,940
 People think Microsoft seems very good,

855
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,060
 but everything else is definitely worse.

856
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,740
 - I will agree with you, I think that they have clearly

857
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,820
 made a good product and now they are fixing it.

858
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,340
 I think part of the reason they are fixing it

859
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,420
 is because there has been so much criticism.

860
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,980
 So I do think, I do think strong.

861
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
 - Absolutely, absolutely, they wouldn't be fixing it

862
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
 because they weren't forced to.

863
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,740
 - Yeah, I think strong criticism is an important part of that

864
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,900
 and that is the spirit in which I criticize.

865
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,500
 - So I've been using Zoom for ages

866
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,300
 because it just worked better than all the alternatives.

867
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,740
 So I mean, I do a lot of video conferencing anyway

868
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,580
 and I do a lot of video conferencing

869
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,180
 with people who have pretty terrible internet connections

870
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,380
 and Zoom was noticeably better than any of the alternatives

871
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,700
 for that, it was better than WebEx,

872
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,180
 it was better than Google Hangouts,

873
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
 it was better than Skype, I mean,

874
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,380
 we didn't try running workshops on Facebook Messenger

875
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,860
 but I suspect it's better than that.

876
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,260
 - Oh God, Facebook Messenger's awful, oh my God.

877
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,940
 - So I'm quite, I think I feel I'm quite relaxed about it

878
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,780
 in that I know it does some terrible things

879
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,860
 but I sort of assume all software is doing

880
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,180
 some terrible things unless I'm using one of the real

881
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,260
 like good open source ones that have been built

882
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,340
 from the ground up for that kind of thing.

883
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,180
 So I'm glad people are aware of these things,

884
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,700
 I'm glad people are pointing them out

885
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,140
 and that they fix them, but otherwise I'm not too,

886
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,260
 I'll end up about it.

887
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,820
 I should say I do use Microsoft Teams a lot now

888
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,700
 because all our work,

889
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
 all our work, well everything basically

890
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,500
 is moved to Office 365

891
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,300
 and Microsoft Teams just works really nicely

892
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,620
 and it just works a lot of the time.

893
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,660
 We haven't run a really huge event in it yet

894
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:56,220
 but we are swapping our weekly seminars to Microsoft Teams

895
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,540
 and they will be, you know,

896
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,580
 we sometimes have got up to 100 people in there

897
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,740
 so I'll see how that works.

898
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,940
 - It's very corporate.

899
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,500
 I want to say two things of reaction to that.

900
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,740
 I'm gonna push back slightly on the thing you said

901
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,180
 about every software doing this.

902
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,500
 I think Zoom is more egregious than most so far.

903
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,860
 I think the point about Facebook is a reasonable one.

904
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,580
 Facebook are obviously in some ways much more egregious

905
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,340
 than almost anyone else.

906
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,940
 But at this point, my neighborhood community group is on,

907
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,740
 Facebook, my streets WhatsApp group is obviously hosted

908
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,260
 on a Facebook owned service,

909
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,340
 all of the local shops put their opening times

910
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,540
 and announcements on Facebook.

911
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,660
 So at this point, I must use Facebook to take part

912
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,620
 in my community, which is something I resent hugely

913
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,900
 but does appear to be distressingly true.

914
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,140
 I will say Microsoft Teams is very good.

915
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,340
 I think that the problem there is obviously you need

916
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,060
 an Office 365 subscription, which not everyone has.

917
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,580
 I don't think Microsoft have made any overtures

918
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,940
 towards making Teams free to use.

919
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,740
 I suspect because they see Skype as their consumer

920
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,140
 chatting tool and they don't see Microsoft Teams

921
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,060
 as something they need to open up.

922
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,940
 Whereas Zoom, I believe, have relaxed a lot of their

923
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,700
 restrictions in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

924
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,020
 Ooh, Alison is shaking her head.

925
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,340
 Teams doesn't have a free tier,

926
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,500
 but only the host needs to have the paid account.

927
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
 I think that's the important thing.

928
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,180
 And Office 365 is not expensive,

929
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,060
 if there's just one of you and you're using it

930
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,140
 for this sort of thing.

931
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,100
 People kept saying with the Zoom account,

932
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,380
 because I got paid Zoom account to do the first Thursday,

933
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,980
 "Oh, do you want some help with the cost?"

934
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,220
 And I said, "Well, compared to getting a tube ticket

935
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,460
 "to the pub and buying one pint of beer,"

936
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,460
 it was there, that was the amount.

937
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,460
 So these tools are not expensive compared to the life

938
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,620
 we've just given up to get them.

939
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,740
 - So yeah, that is my crumble.

940
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,180
 - And also, nobody cares about your video chats

941
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,060
 and the pub isn't exactly a secure environment either.

942
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,060
 I don't think the cabinet should be using Zoom.

943
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,260
 I did think that was a bit shocking

944
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,300
 and no doubt they've done magic cabinet things,

945
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,900
 but seeing as they don't for anything else,

946
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,220
 it doesn't seem very likely that they really absolutely see.

947
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,180
 - Well, that's one other thing,

948
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,860
 which is because Zoom uses a predictable naming scheme

949
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,700
 for archives of the chats,

950
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,020
 the Washington Post was able to reverse engineer it,

951
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,820
 see stuff like therapy sessions

952
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,860
 and things that had been conducted over Zoom.

953
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,140
 And so I do think that there are problems here

954
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,340
 that do need addressing,

955
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,860
 but I entirely take the point,

956
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,540
 especially for the first Thursday,

957
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,260
 it sounded like it was by far the best tool for the job.

958
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,020
 But I do think you've just got to be careful

959
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,580
 and just be aware and I will post links in the show notes

960
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,740
 to help you do that.

961
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,180
 Let's do a short staying sane in the apocalypse bit

962
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,780
 to round out the show and then we can go back

963
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,460
 to having nothing to do.

964
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,860
 - I was going to call you out for your privilege

965
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,340
 on six days over Easter and talk about having nothing to do

966
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,540
 because a lot of people I know are actually losing

967
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,780
 their jobs now, that their businesses kept them on

968
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,580
 for a little while, but the workers now dried up,

969
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,860
 the cash flow isn't there and they've had to let people go

970
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,380
 rather than fall over.

971
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,660
 So people are losing their jobs and that is very sad

972
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,940
 and it's happening quite a lot.

973
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,060
 And by quite a lot, if you look at there's a map

974
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,620
 for the United States where the spike

975
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,140
 in the unemployment rate is something like 10 times

976
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,460
 the largest unemployment spike in the last 50 years.

977
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,860
 So that's a big thing.

978
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,700
 I have had to give up my business for the time being.

979
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,460
 I mean, it will come back and all will be well.

980
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,260
 But all of my income was dried up because the print

981
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,860
 on the other side, I've basically stopped shipping T-shirts

982
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,300
 now and I decided I couldn't run a next store at a point

983
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,500
 where we were likely to get fit quite soon

984
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,220
 and people kept asking me where their stuff was.

985
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,500
 I did have a 24-hour period when I'd finally got my

986
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:48,020
 much delayed shipment from China and sent all my old pins

987
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,980
 and sent some new pins and then I decided

988
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,340
 no, it's time to shut up with it.

989
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,180
 But I'm fine.

990
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,380
 People should not be worried about me,

991
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,180
 but people should be worried about all of the people

992
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,580
 who have no income and their savings,

993
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,860
 of whom they're owed greatly.

994
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,620
 - Yeah, and that's why I say I'm privileged.

995
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,020
 I think I am still employed and my job does not require me

996
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,940
 to go anywhere.

997
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,580
 So I think I am incredibly lucky that that is the case

998
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,620
 and I don't want anyone to think that I'm unaware of that

999
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,860
 'cause I am, I am very aware of that.

1000
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,140
 - You also mentioned post and I have been getting things

1001
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,860
 posted to my house and a few of them have taken a long time

1002
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,500
 but I did order something at 12pm on Friday

1003
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,420
 and it was delivered at 12pm on Saturday last weekend

1004
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,780
 which I was a little bit confused by

1005
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,260
 'cause I thought the post was taking longer

1006
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,180
 and that one just seemed to sail through

1007
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,820
 and I'm not entirely sure why.

1008
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,380
 - I'm not really ordering a lot to the actual postal service

1009
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,740
 because I don't tend to post mediators or things like that

1010
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,020
 but also because Thailand has a thriving system

1011
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,500
 of motorbike delivery guys and messenger guys.

1012
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,660
 So for instance, I ordered some gin at about, I think,

1013
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,340
 4pm on Thursday and about 5pm a man on a motorbike

1014
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,620
 turned up with my gin, it's pretty good.

1015
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,620
 - We ordered some beer from Wildcard Brewery,

1016
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,820
 a link is in the show notes,

1017
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,980
 who are one of the breweries from the corner from us

1018
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,020
 and they delivered it just within a few hours

1019
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,940
 of us ordering it but that was not postal,

1020
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,180
 that was indeed a bloke from the brewery in a van.

1021
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,220
 - Yes, we get veg boxes, we've had veg boxes delivered,

1022
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,900
 ever since we've lived in this house,

1023
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,020
 they have had to stop taking new customers

1024
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,380
 because they are so in demand now

1025
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,660
 but we are getting all our vegetables delivered once week

1026
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,060
 and we ordered some coffee off the internet

1027
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,220
 and a man from the roaster came round

1028
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,340
 and dropped the coffee off, we ordered beer

1029
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,460
 and that was bulderingly actually posted from the warehouse

1030
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,540
 which is a 20 minute walk from our house

1031
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,180
 but that also arrived and we have been getting takeaway

1032
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,380
 more than usual in a sort of effort

1033
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,500
 to support our local restaurants

1034
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,620
 and that has been again very efficient.

1035
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,500
 So we are finding that it is easy

1036
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,140
 to get things brought to us which is nice.

1037
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,660
 - The thing I found most stressful,

1038
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,460
 not in the first week but as things went on

1039
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,460
 was not being able to get an almond croissant or a flat white

1040
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,860
 and we, after some considerable failure

1041
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,340
 to find anyone who would deliver,

1042
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,500
 we did in fact find someone to deliver these things

1043
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,820
 to us yesterday for vast amounts of money

1044
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,500
 but I was very happy.

1045
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,300
 - There is a bakery called Hochsten,

1046
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,340
 the bake house in Southampton that do sourdough bread

1047
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,540
 and lovely pastries and they are still delivery also

1048
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,820
 so we have been fine on the pastry front.

1049
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,580
 - I also have a local bakery that I frequent quite often

1050
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,340
 and since they are open and don't normally do deliveries

1051
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,140
 and so they're trying to very hard to pivot

1052
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,020
 to delivery right now, I have been there a couple of times

1053
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,980
 to do a sort of arms length by a croissant

1054
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,300
 on my daily exercise walk which is very nice.

1055
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,180
 And most of the coffee shops will basically send me

1056
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,780
 an ice coffee on a motorbike if I wanted it

1057
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,420
 but I have not yet reached that point.

1058
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,340
 - That is fair.

1059
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,500
 We are still allowed out here for exercise once a day

1060
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,260
 so I've been taking advantage of that

1061
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,820
 to thoroughly explore the streets near my house.

1062
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,140
 Alison have you still been going outside regularly?

1063
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,500
 Are you still driving to a nearby park or are you?

1064
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,580
 - No, no, no, we've not driven.

1065
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,180
 In fact, I have to, although it's not one of the approved

1066
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,820
 reasons to go out, I am going to send Stephen in the car

1067
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,980
 for a little drive because we have a car that really will,

1068
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,660
 the battery will pack in if we don't drive it

1069
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,820
 once in a couple of weeks.

1070
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,580
 So we're just going to go for a drive

1071
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,900
 and we'll say we're caring for somebody if our if stop.

1072
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,660
 I feel like I have elderly relatives

1073
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,380
 and having a functional car is quite important to us

1074
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,100
 and it keeps breaking down.

1075
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,660
 - Oh no, yeah, it sounds good.

1076
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,620
 - But otherwise, I haven't been out very much.

1077
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,580
 We have a garden, our garden is more,

1078
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,380
 it's not really, I think garden is too strong a word.

1079
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,020
 We have a patch of scrub land attached

1080
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,660
 to the back of our house and so that's quite nice.

1081
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,740
 I mean, just a little one, but it turned out that

1082
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,740
 if you'd elect a garden consistently for 20 years,

1083
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,460
 it looks quite neglected.

1084
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,780
 So we've been out there a bit.

1085
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,980
 Stephen has been teaching me Tai Chi in the sunshine

1086
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,380
 and he says, let's do a warmup

1087
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,660
 and then about five minutes later,

1088
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,860
 I'm like, I've done it off now.

1089
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,980
 - That's fair.

1090
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,620
 Liz, are you staying healthy?

1091
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,140
 - So I haven't been going out for too many walks,

1092
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,660
 partly because I live in a very built up area

1093
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,780
 with pretty narrow pavements.

1094
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,980
 So it's quite hard to do any kind of distancing

1095
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,300
 if you run into anyone.

1096
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,420
 It's also April, which is the hottest month of the year.

1097
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,900
 And so that's also an attempt to going for a nice walk

1098
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,740
 because it might be 36 degrees outside.

1099
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,020
 I have been carrying on though

1100
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,160
 with my doing aerobics in front of YouTube plan.

1101
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,260
 To a point where I have now found a channel

1102
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,500
 which will do me a six week exercise plan

1103
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,140
 and we'll see if I can do six weeks

1104
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,100
 of indoor YouTube aerobics without going around the bend.

1105
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,180
 - That sounds good.

1106
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,220
 - So we haven't discussed books or TV or video games

1107
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,900
 or anything like that, but we are at the point in time

1108
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,180
 where we have probably talked for enough this week.

1109
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,180
 So we will get to that next week.

1110
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,740
 So that was episode two of the OctaThought podcast.

1111
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,380
 As always, if you have any thoughts, comments, criticisms,

1112
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,940
 wafflings or other things you'd like to tell us,

1113
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,660
 please give us an email at octathoughtcast@gmail.com

1114
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,420
 or tweet with the hashtag octathoughtcast

1115
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,540
 and we will mention tweets and emails on future episodes.

1116
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,020
 But for now, it's goodbye from me.

1117
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,500
 - And goodbye from me.

1118
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,600
 - And goodbye from me.

1119
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,620
 - The music used in this episode was fanfare for space
