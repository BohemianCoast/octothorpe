1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 No it's before the clap you can't use things before the clap boy.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 Okay, new rule I guess.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,000
 I can.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,500
 That was my traditional free podcast burp.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:20,000
 If the title of this podcast wasn't very definitely going to be,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Mothia, that would be a contender.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
 It's the title of this podcast going to...

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,500
 Do you think anyone else is going to find Mothia?

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,000
 Funny.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 I mean, if they don't, they're better strap in because they're in for a long one.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:55,500
 Anyway, hello everyone and welcome to the 20th episode of OctaThort,

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,000
 a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I'm John Coxon.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I'm Liz Batty.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Uh, Alison, are you okay?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Alison has dissolved into gagors.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 We're sorry, listeners.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Alison is here.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 She's just can't come to the podcast right now.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Oh, I'm Alison Scott.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 This episode will be going out on the 10th of December, um, 2020.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And we have some letters of comment, but first we have a very serious plea.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Uh, we want to talk to you about something that's very close to our hearts, all three of us.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Um, and, and we urge you to take this very seriously.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Um, please don't send me any more We To Bix.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I'm begging you.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Please stop.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Please.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I think I've got time to change my shopping list for tomorrow.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I've got enough.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Someone sent me Claire, Claire, Claire, Breiley of Croydon, sent me 108 We To Bix.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And then my half brother, Dave, who I didn't know listened to the show, but hi, Dave.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Uh, he also threatened to send me 108 We To Bix.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And I just, I don't need more than 200 We To Bix in my house.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Um, so please, please everyone consider me closed for We To Bix at this time.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 But thank you very much for thinking of me.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 If your correspondence involved We To Bix, this correspondence is closed.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But if your correspondence was about We To Bix, that's probably still fine.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And indeed we have letters of comment, all of which mentioned We To Bix.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And if you, if you do threaten to send We To Bix, you may find, um, that you get a surprise.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 God, that sounds ominous.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So letters of comment.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Duncan McGregor has tweeted out as to say a minor point of contention is that boxing Helena was directed by Jennifer Lynch, who is David Lynch's daughter.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And then he tweeted again saying, I just realized I meant to type correction, but also correct my mind.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So thank you, listen to Duncan, uh, for letting us know, uh, we apologize for the error.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And and wrote in tweeted at us to say that she finds the modern phrase key learnings makes her teeth grind.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Um, and so we will attempt, we will treat that as a key learning and we will avoid it here with.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Who said key learnings?

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I don't think I don't know if anyone actually said it, but, um, okay.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 How does she feel about onboarding?

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I don't know how she feels about onboarding. She didn't mention it, but we did get a letter from Claire Riley of Croydon.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 So Claire sent us a poem, uh, which is very excellent. Thank you, Claire.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And, um, she, she didn't say that onboard it. Is it a real word?

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 She just thinks it's a horrible verbed contraction.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Um, and then Mark, she says this lock and Mark has not locked us.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 That's important for you to know listeners, although I would, I would like him to, because I am now curious because she says this lock comes so late that Mark has surely written to you already and mentioned his proposed companion terms, which he feels helped to mitigate the horror

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 off boarding for managing the process when someone leaves and over boarding for when they've been sacked.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And that, I think, are, those two words I think are valuable additions to the lexicon.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I'm, I'm not convinced we didn't use off boarding at my last job, and I left it in 2012, so.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I don't know. I've never worked in a job that had jargon.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Oh, you haven't lived. You know, you have, obviously, you just, if you don't think your job has jargon, you've...

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 No, and my job just has real words that everyone understands like Magnetosphere and Plasmusheet Dynamics.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And then she says, she thanks us for the autotop fridge bag that, that we sent her, and she explains that she shall unfridge it immediately, which we are glad to hear Claire.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 We should mention the fact that if you're stuck for a Christmas present or stocking filler, you can now get fantastic octotop merch in the form of fridge magnets.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I'm possibly some other merch as well if I get my act together by Thursday, but don't hold your breath. There will be a link in the show notes to how you can buy a fine octotop magnet with our logo on.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And, and we're going to use it as the art for the chapter heading so that you'll be able to see a picture of it if you actually look at your chapter headings, which obviously you don't, because nobody actually does that.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 If you go to the show notes, there will be links to places where you can buy Allison's excellent octotop fridge magnets and where you can buy Allison's excellent octotop t-shirts, because I want an octotopop t-shirt, Allison, and if I say you're going to put it in the show notes, it will happen magically.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Frid round it's a three pounds plus a pound for delivery and all of the details will be somewhere.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Octotop t-shirts are purple.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Yeah, I mean, there could not be a purple, that would be crazy.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Okay, and we should read the poem. Lines on receiving a most unexpected fridge magnet in the post. You might have just run an online punctuation.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 But Octotop still had a clear obligation.

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 What must you do in the cons aftermath?

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Ducking a challenge would seem quite pathetic.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So would a lie, but his proof quite magnetic.

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Covered in weetabics, John in the bath.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Thank you, Claire.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Jerry Kaufman emailed me about my trip report, Best Trip Ever, and he says he enjoyed it quite a bit.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 It was cool and awesome.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And then he apologizes and says that Claire has probably, he's beat enough about awesome.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 He's sure.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And that is true.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Over the last 15 years, Claire has indeed teased me quite a lot about the word awesome.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But you know, it's good.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Did you just start that sentence with that's fair?

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 That's fair.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It was fair, Allison.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Look, right?

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I'm a very egalitarian man.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Discon 3 have sent out a poll to, um, initially I thought to members, but I think they're trying to spread it as far and as wide as they can.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 So if you're listening to this, hopefully you saw it.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I'm asking whether or not people would rather, they ran a virtual event in their original dates,

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 or they ran a physical event the weekend before Christmas in 2021.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And I filled in this survey and although I'm not sure whether or not I would go to DC the weekend before Christmas,

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I do think I'd rather they try and do a physical world comment of virtual one.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 So I tentatively voted for that option.

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Um, Liz and Allison, did you do this survey?

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And what did you think?

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I did do the survey. Um, I mean, I'm not currently a member of Discon 3 and to be honest, whether they held a,

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 if they held it in person in August, I probably wouldn't go.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And if they held it in person in December, I probably wouldn't go.

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Um, but for different reasons, because I think if they try and hold it in person in August,

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 no one is going to know whether that is actually possible for a good few months yet.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And so no one will actually be able to plan.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And the reason I wouldn't go in person in December is because it dates the 15th to the 19th of December,

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 and that is much too close to the end of the year.

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 So I think I said that I might attend their virtual one if they run, if they run that one,

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 but I want to end in person and I would not attend an in person.

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Well, but I can definitely, I can definitely see why they've done it.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Because if you have put all that time and effort into thinking about a Worldcon and it's going to get dumped on by a pandemic,

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 and you could possibly just shift it a few months and do it in person,

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 then I could definitely see why that is a very tempting option.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 However, I'm not sure it's a good idea.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 I have not answered the survey and I think it might be a bit late now, even when we record,

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 um, because I felt that I was rather a biased observer in that I'm,

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I certainly wouldn't be going to an August physical convention under the circumstances,

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 though I had previously had some plans to try and go to disc on.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 I, there is no chance that I am ever going to go to a convention anywhere the weekend before Christmas,

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 unless I can, um, trade and I think that will be too difficult.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 So, and in fact, I really couldn't anyway.

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And, um, so, but if it was a virtual convention, I might go, particularly if they,

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 they've got a lot of things have developed from where Conzeland was,

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 and I think they could probably run an awesome virtual Worldcon if they put their minds to it.

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And this might, if the, if the, if the decision comes down in favour of virtualising,

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 they've got quite a few months to get that right.

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Um, I am unconvinced that they're certainly going to have a,

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 be able to have a physical convention in December.

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Um, so I think there's a chance that they will be forced to virtualize,

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 again, and we'll find themselves virtualising at an unbelievably terrible time,

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 and it will all be a big mess.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Um, I wonder that they may have some, they may have some commitments with the hotel,

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 that are difficult for them because that's, all these conventions do have issues with hotels.

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Um, why don't you think they'll be able to do an in-person convention in December?

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Because I think that does look like a reasonably good bet.

135
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Yeah, I mean, they think they will be able to.

136
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I mean, I think there has to be some chance that they won't be able to.

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Um, if they do, I think it will be quite small because it's a difficult time for travellers,

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 everyone has said.

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 The Smoffs have also got their, um, nickers in a collective twist about it because it's after Smofcon,

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 and that, um, that, that messes up all of the ways that Smoffs do things,

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 but I don't think that matters.

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Well, surely it messes up even more things than Smofcon.

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Uh, sure, because it would, well, for one thing, it would mean that site selection for 2022

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 would take place extremely late and basically cut six months off their convention cycle.

145
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Um, I can't wear the bids are for 2022.

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Um, not 2022, 2023, I mean, actually.

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 The two bids for 2023 are Chengdu in China and Memphis in Tennessee.

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Okay, so a potentially very late 2021 Worldcon, if they chose to run site selection at the convention,

149
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 would potentially mess up the 2023 bid by giving them six months less to prepare,

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 and also potentially mess up anyone who wanted to run a 2023, uh, NASVIC if they wanted to do that

151
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 because they won't know who will be required.

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Um, so I think there's, there's stuff like that, which would almost certainly cause more problems,

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 and I guess if you start wearing the Q goes right at the end of 2021,

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 it doesn't cause the same issues, but it does push them back quite a long way.

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 I was going to say, as, as has been noted, um, by many of the people on Facebook, um, it kind of causes havoc to all the other conventions that are also thinking about whether they can run, say between November and February 2021 to 2022,

156
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 because people who've made commitments to do things and work on this con are now thinking, oh, but hang on, now you're going to be two weeks after my own little local science fiction convention.

157
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Um, and that messes those up.

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So that could be a problem.

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 I think, I think I hadn't thought about the problem with science selection, but, um, I suppose, I suppose that is an important question, which is how would you do that? Would you, would you try and do science selection at the physical convention, or would you have a virtual thing earlier?

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And how would you do the hugos?

161
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Um, I guess, I guess there's not really a huge problem with having the hugos at Christmas, but it, it seems a bit of an odd thing.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 I mean, you could just run a much more relaxed Hugo nomination, Hugo voting program process with a few moments in there, and then the administrators would have plenty of time to count the votes in your ward them in December.

163
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Did discana having an all staff weekend? And I assume that this is the sort of thing that they are working through at the all staff weekend before coming to a conclusion?

164
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 That's why I think I've probably too late to fill in the survey.

165
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I see, yes. I assume that they are taking the views of the staff at the all staff weekend, working through the issues at the all staff weekend, and then the board is going to make a decision shortly.

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I do think site selection is very interesting.

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Listeners who are not mired in, um, Worldcon politics may not know that the 2023 Worldcon bid is really spectacularly contested to a degree that I think is, is, is quite contested even by Worldcon standards because it's not a case of there are two bids and they both have very,

168
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 they both have proponents and detractors and they have some very, they are offering very different propositions being, um, Chengdu and Memphis.

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Yes, I think we could probably discuss that in more detail, kind of in a different episode.

170
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 For listeners who may not know, Alison's busiest time of the year is Christmas because she is a person what sells things on that internet.

171
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Like Octa Thorpe fridge magnets and t-shirts. Yes, and that means that she is busy over Christmas, so a convention for her would be a significant drop in income.

172
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I don't have that problem because I'm an academic.

173
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I could probably take time off and go to DC in December.

174
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 So I did vote because I think if it was rescheduled, I would probably go.

175
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 I've got family in the US and I'd be cool to have Christmas with them.

176
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And yeah, I could see it happening if there was a vaccine and if it was safe.

177
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I mean, obviously those are two gigantic ifs, but so, and I think I'd be more likely to go to that than I would a online convention because I don't know.

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I'm not, I didn't go to Conzeland and I'm not, I'm not sure if I'd go to DC online, but maybe I'm, maybe I'm selling it.

179
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It slightly depends how well they do the social spaces.

180
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I suppose. But yes, Liz, would you, would you, what was the chance that you would go to DC in December if they rescheduled?

181
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I think it's very unlikely for a couple of reasons.

182
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 One is that I would like to see my family at Christmas, which I will not be able to do this year.

183
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And it is just infeasible really for me to go all the way to the US for the 15th to 19th and then go to the UK for Christmas straight after.

184
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 The second one is just my issue, which is that the big conference in my field, which is held in the US tends to be held in very late November,

185
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 in which case I would probably not want to go to the US twice.

186
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I actually definitely wouldn't want to go to the US twice, but they're not quite close enough together.

187
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I could do both of them in one go.

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And I think there is also a third reason, which is, I think we're sort of assuming that there will be widespread, you know, vaccination by the end of 2021.

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 But that is actually not an assumption, which is going to hold true for everywhere.

190
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 So we don't know what the requirements are going to be for requiring vaccination if it would be required to enter the US.

191
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 It would be required to go on airplanes to the US.

192
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 But even if you think nearly everyone in the US will have been vaccinated by the end of 2021, this definitely does not hold true for countries which have less money and have not pre bought 600 million doses of vaccine.

193
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 So for instance, vaccination here is currently scheduled to start in June 2021 and to maybe finish sometime mid 2022. So it seems highly unlikely that I will have been vaccinated.

194
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And I think that's going to be a problem for those Worldcon attendees.

195
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I mean, I don't think it's an insurmountable problem because there's already like a million other.

196
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 A million other problems for people trying to attend Worldcon's from low and in middle income countries like visas and the cost and all of those things.

197
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 But this might just be an extra one on top of that. And we don't know how it's going to work yet.

198
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Yeah, that's all fair. I think I support the decision they're making because I think basically it was clear from the server they sent out that basically these are the two choices like they can't hold it in 2022 because the 2021 Worldcon.

199
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And like this is the only date they could move to if they want to try and do it physically.

200
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 So I do think it's worth asking the question.

201
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 I will be very curious to see what happens as a result.

202
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Another thing that this con three have done is they have announced that they are exercising their their special was for skivin right to assign a special Hugo category.

203
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 And they're going to do a Hugo for the best video game. They follow in the footsteps of LA con four. I think that did this in the mid noughties.

204
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 It didn't work then. Will it work now? Liz your opinions.

205
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I was going to say you say LA con did it didn't LA con run the nominations and then realize that they didn't have enough nominations to run a sensible.

206
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 So that's what category and then not run it. I think it is definitely I think it's actually well overdue that we have another go at this.

207
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 I think probably there are more people playing games when you.

208
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I think there might be more people playing games when I think there are definitely more people playing a variety of stuff because they have access to phones and tablets and more mobile gaming devices.

209
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 So people who might not think they play games definitely do play games are and maybe more of them will now have stuff they want to nominate.

210
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 So I think it's definitely worth a go. I think the difficulty might be that I think games have quite a long life and sometimes have quite a high time investment.

211
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 So for instance, I've played quite a lot of games this year, but I'm not sure any of them were released in 2020.

212
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And you also get to have fun with things like what about long running games which release updates or new content in 2020.

213
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Because there is for instance a new World of Warcraft expansion, but are you awarding the World of Warcraft expansion or are you sort of tacitly awarding 15 years worth of World of Warcraft, which is not a problem right now because we haven't had any other video game.

214
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 So I think it's a very important thing to do with this game.

215
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I think it's a very important thing to do with this game.

216
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 I think it's a very important thing to do with this game.

217
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I think it's a very important thing to do with this game.

218
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 But then it's like if you wanted to do this more often, you wanted to make it a permanent category, then you have to think about that.

219
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 So it is a subcommittee which is chaired by Ira Alexander day.

220
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I apologize if I got that name wrong.

221
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And is the games Hugo subcommittee of the Hugo study committee and they gathered a bunch of data and evidence according to file 770.

222
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 I think if we want to go deep into the nuts and bolts of how the award will work, we probably ought to go away and before next episode, learn how it does work and have opinions based on that.

223
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Because if we say a bunch of things about it would never work and then we read it and we're like, actually that's all questionable.

224
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Yeah, okay. So before we do this properly, which we will do in a future episode, we can go, "Ah ha, we've done our homework."

225
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 But this is just a hot take on the announcement, which is a different thing.

226
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Hot take.

227
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 So hot take.

228
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And my hot take is that most people in the world, and certainly most attenders of Worldcons play video games, how many of those...

229
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 play video games that are narrative, I am not persuaded by.

230
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Most of the video games that people actually play are not either not narrative at all, or the narrative element is so unbelievably shallow compared to actual, actual science fictional content, even the science fictional content on television and movies.

231
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 The amount of the typical Marvel movie, which as you know I criticise quite a lot, still has a ton more narrative content than even quite...

232
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 That is 100% steaming bullshit, Alison. And you know it is.

233
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Like, I've played Horizon Zero Dawn, there is more world building in the first 20 minutes of that game than there is the entirety of the MCU.

234
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And if that doesn't count as narrative, then what does?

235
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Was it released in 2020?

236
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I don't think so, but I believe that the sequel is either this year or next year.

237
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 But I don't think... I definitely think... So there are two things here, which is firstly, dot all narrative has to be...

238
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 You can have emergent narrative through world building, and I think that is something the games do very well, which virtually all other media that's recognised with the Hugo doesn't.

239
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And I think the fact that that is a different sort of science fiction narrative doesn't make it a less valid science fiction narrative.

240
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 But secondly, there are loads of highly narrative games that tell really complex stories over hours of gameplay.

241
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And I think it will be interesting because I think if it doesn't work, that will tell us a lot, but I don't think there's an inherent reason why it couldn't.

242
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 It will be down to whether or not people who vote for the Hugo's also play recent video games.

243
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 I think if they do, this will be a successful category.

244
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 My question is whether that is true. And that, I think, might end up being it's downfall.

245
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Because I know I play a lot of games, but I haven't played much from 2020 in terms of video games.

246
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I have just started playing a multiple award winning game from 2020, which...

247
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Is it called "Dynamo Crossing"?

248
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Where one group of people are saying this has amazing emergent narrative, and the other group of people are going, "Nah, it's a junkie Chinese free-to-play game that is just stealing your money."

249
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 And I think both of these things are probably true.

250
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 But I will be interested to see whether the narrative that emerges is actually...

251
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I don't know, satisfying stories from emergent narrative.

252
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Yeah, okay. They've probably got a lot in this.

253
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 So reading through the report from the games Hugo people, a couple of examples they gave of recent games,

254
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 are Assassin's Creed Odyssey, God of War, the Marvel Spider-Man game, Monster Hunter.

255
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 So they're all Death Stranding.

256
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Oh, they missed Star Wars Jedi IV in order.

257
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 So I think it's twofold, which is firstly, emergent narrative is important.

258
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 But secondly, I think video games over the last...

259
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I mean, it's probably not fair to say they never did this,

260
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 but I definitely think that in recent times there has been a shift towards video games telling more and more complex narratives.

261
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And whether or not that's necessarily a good thing, it's kind of up for debate,

262
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 because I remember we had a panel at the two... at your EasterCon, I was in at Follicon,

263
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 where one of the panelists was like, "I've been agitating for games to tell more directed narratives for ages,

264
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and now they've started, I don't like it."

265
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I'm like, I mean, you know, who cares what you wish for?

266
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Yeah, it's fair.

267
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 So the other half of my hot take, before John interrupted and said that is Stephen Pylov-Bollocks,

268
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 the other half of my hot take is, I also don't think it will work because I think there are far too many possible nominees

269
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 and the nominations will be spread way too thin, and the ones that will actually emerge to the finalists

270
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 will indeed be games which are the latest instalment in some massive franchise,

271
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 and I just don't think there's any joy in any of that, but there we go.

272
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 We wouldn't want a Hugo Cateri to be repeatedly dominated by the latest iteration of the same thing over and over again.

273
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 You wouldn't want something like Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form or Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form

274
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 or Selly Proceed or Fanzied or FanRite or Best Novel or Best Novella. That would be terrible.

275
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 But I think that the best video game, because of the lack of familiarity with the...

276
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I mean, you can still watch every major genre movie that's released in a year, for example,

277
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 which is why discussions of Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form have such legs.

278
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You cannot possibly play every relevant quality video game that's released in a year,

279
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 or even a tiny fraction of them. Most people are only going to be playing a few,

280
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 even if they're very keen gamers. And AAA games are extremely expensive,

281
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 so most people can't afford to actually survey the field in them, even if they had no other life.

282
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 That's actually really interesting. So just to follow up on that, that's a really interesting point,

283
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 because I was about to say there, you just wait for them to be cheap, and then I'm like,

284
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 "I have, but if you do that, you can't nominate."

285
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Not in 2020, you don't.

286
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Yeah, exactly. So that is actually a really interesting point, which is, like,

287
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 if you bought Horizon Zero Dawn today, it would cost you about £15.

288
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 But if you had bought it when it was actually first out, it would have been three or four times more expensive.

289
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And so this is a Hugo category in a field where... I mean, obviously books get cheaper,

290
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 but they don't... And movies get cheaper because they come on Netflix.

291
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 The initial outlay in what sort of being up to date is far less, and there's...

292
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Yeah, that is a very interesting point.

293
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Since I'm currently... I'm currently skimming through the big report about best gamer and Tractic Experience category,

294
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 which I believe none of us has read, and does actually cover quite a number of these points.

295
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 So maybe we should read it. Also, it's got a link to a speedrun of Dragon Age Origins in 40 minutes,

296
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 which I'm dying to go and watch because it took me, like, 120 hours to finish that game.

297
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 So... Yeah, that's the other problem. They say there's 100 hours of gameplay in this, and I look at it and I go,

298
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 "I know that if I were to do this, it would be more like 400 hours."

299
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 I think we should... I think Jon should cobble together some kind of sensible saying anything else.

300
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Good luck with the edit, Jon!

301
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I knew it would be a nightmare.

302
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 When I'm not here this weekend, I am at an event that is being run in Gathertown.

303
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Now, Gathertown's an online service that we didn't use, that we did consider for punctuation.

304
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And in this thing, you can move around. There are places you can sit and chat to people.

305
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Some of those are private, so your conversation is private.

306
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 When you go to sit and a place, it turns into a video chat, or when you are near people, you turn into a video chat.

307
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 So I had a brilliant interactive moment because I walked into this thing for the first time yesterday morning,

308
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 and immediately found myself in conversation with somebody who's basically a superstar in the field, and that was quite nice.

309
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And, you know, I wouldn't have thought that he'd be a person I was likely to meet.

310
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 So that was quite nice, and I liked some of that, but more generally, my experience has not been entirely pleasant,

311
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 but partly because they're doing something where they're streaming.

312
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 People are making the talks in Gathertown, and then that is being streamed to an overflow space,

313
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 and then also streamed to YouTube, and all of those streams are way clunky compared to what you get to say a Zoom webinar.

314
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 So the actual video and audio experience is not as good, the little windows that you see people in a tiny.

315
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It's got all of the problems that Zoom has in large numbers of people needing to turn off their microphone and video,

316
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 but not necessarily being able to see how to do that.

317
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 But the primary problem I'm having is one that people might have had by a punctuation, but we wouldn't know about it,

318
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 which is that apart from one person who told me it was happening, I don't actually know anyone there,

319
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 and because of the way it set up, the ability to meet new people is not that straightforward.

320
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And they had interactive items, but they had all their interactive items at the same time,

321
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 so if that wasn't a time that was good for you, it wouldn't work.

322
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 So I feel like one of the things that made me feel was there might be people out there for who punctuation felt a bit like that.

323
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 They're probably not listening to this podcast, but if you know people who punctuation didn't work,

324
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 I'd really like those people to answer the feedback questionnaire.

325
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 But also, Gavitow is quite expensive, so this convention had a proper fee, not a fiver.

326
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And that fee seems to be, it's also non-profit, it's being organised by enthusiasts.

327
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Almost the entire amount I paid is covered by the amount they will have paid Gavitow for my per user for the weekend.

328
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 So it's absolutely not a good example of something that costs money, but doesn't necessarily deliver the outcome any better than what we've got.

329
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 I will say just very quickly, so firstly it sounds like Gavitow.

330
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 It doesn't sound like, I've used Gavitow to a great effect, we used it for a post-assession at a professional conference,

331
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 I was at yesterday and the day before, no sorry Thursday and Friday, and it worked very well for what we were using it for,

332
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 but I think you do have to be very careful, there are things that it won't work for at all,

333
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 and it sounds like what your experience is, one of them.

334
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 But I will also say that I think the problem meeting people at conferences or conventions where you don't know anyone is really difficult to solve.

335
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 So I think that might be a topic that we could discuss in a future episode, both from the perspective of trying to crack it at virtual conventions,

336
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 but also trying to crack it for people who come to physical conventions after the event has subsided.

337
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Yeah, I think the things that we didn't crack are not so much, I think there's probably lots of things that we didn't crack,

338
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 but some of the things that we didn't crack that I would really like to crack are also things that affect physical conventions,

339
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 like essentially the flow of social space, like this was sometimes a proper punctuation either, there was no one in the bar,

340
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 or the bar was a big noisy conversation, it didn't work for me, but there was no one in a smaller conversation,

341
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 or we didn't really do enough to introduce people to each other and get people more involved early on,

342
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 I don't think we've really cracked those at many in-person conventions, there are always times when I've gone,

343
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 "Oh, the bar is too noisy, I'm going to give up and go home."

344
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Oh, there's lots of people in the bar, but I don't know any of them, and I don't know who to talk to, that kind of thing.

345
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 So yeah, maybe we can crack them in virtual conventions, but then when we go back to physical conventions,

346
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 we can bring some of the lessons along.

347
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 I think that a friend of me and Liz are, I had a conversation with a friend who said that one by a punctuation,

348
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 they'd sort of wandered through the bar, not seen anyone they recognised or got to bed early,

349
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 and for them, that was incredibly similar to the feeling of a real convention, and I was like,

350
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 "Yay, I think, I'm not sure, but I do think I don't want to, I think it is a problem that persists,

351
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 and there's been a problem since Kvitjes started, and I am very keen to try and solve it by not going to,

352
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 I'm not going to say we're going to crack it, but we'll discuss it, I will try to go up with some ideas."

353
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I mean, obviously, some of it is like, if you, you know, you might not want to meet lots of strangers.

354
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 But yeah, like, so I think in general, like, as an extrovert, I want to meet all the people all the time

355
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 and talk to them loudly, but I am aware that I am an extrovert, and so there might be people for whom

356
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 it's not their ultimate goal in any situation.

357
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 I actually, at this event, I did actually have a little moment of going,

358
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 "Well, I am an extrovert, and I am happy to talk to people loudly and meet all the people.

359
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 I'm not necessarily in a space of my life where I want, I necessarily want to make 60 new friends in a new fandom this weekend."

360
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 So I kind of turned it off in a way that I might not have done in real life.

361
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 So, real life, sorry.

362
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 I'm trying to avoid that.

363
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 If I'd actually been there for the weekend and I'd be committed to spending the whole weekend there,

364
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 "Oh, you betcha, I would have worked the room until I found myself with a companion of people to spend the rest of the weekend with you."

365
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Which I don't think would have taken long.

366
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 I mean, I think they were nice people that have things in common with me.

367
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Yeah, I think I am less extroverted than either of you.

368
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 I mean, that's not hard.

369
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Did we mention the bell curve earlier, Liz?

370
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Yeah, I mean, I think on the bell curve, I'm somewhere in the middle, which is,

371
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 I like coming and chatting to people, but I don't necessarily need it to be like a loud,

372
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 "I'm gonna meet everyone."

373
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 I'm also old and grumpy at this point, and so sometimes it's like,

374
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 "Well, I'd like to talk to people, but I don't really want to talk to new people.

375
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 I want to talk to people I already know."

376
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 It's hard to subtly nip into the zoom, see if there's anyone you know,

377
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 and then if it's not nip out again, I guess I could claim technical problems.

378
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Whereas in the bar, you can kind of walk through the bar in a purposeful manner,

379
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 like you have somewhere to go, and if there's no in the bar,

380
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 you want to sit and chat to you, walk straight through to the side.

381
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Okay, so here's the thing.

382
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Gathertown is great for that.

383
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Ah.

384
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 You walk through the Gathertown, and you see all the people in the little groups,

385
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 and you see the little names, and you have a list of everyone who's online at Gathertown.

386
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Yep, and you can get directions.

387
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 You can click the person.

388
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And you can locate people and go and find them, which is unbelievably useful,

389
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 and I would like that for the real world right now, please.

390
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 You could go and find them, even if they don't know you're doing that.

391
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 That would be great.

392
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 That would solve many of my zoom.

393
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 It's a bit stalky, but it's very, very good.

394
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 So, I mean, I want to give this platform it's to you.

395
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 It has some really good features.

396
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Oh, yeah, 100%.

397
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 If you haven't looked it up and you enjoy video or Pokemon, go and look it up,

398
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 or, you know, other top-down RPGs with Pixlaid Graphics are available.

399
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 I think what I'm saying is I'd happily run a party in Gathertown for people I already know.

400
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Oh, yeah, 100%.

401
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 I just wouldn't try to put talks and panels into it at all.

402
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 And the thing is, like, we could have used Gathertown for the social spaces punctuation,

403
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 and in some ways that would have given us something we didn't have

404
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 with the other three services we were using.

405
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 But I am, one of the things we were trying to do was every time we added a new service

406
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 to that mix of services we were trying to make sure it added enough to be worth the extra complexity.

407
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 And that is something I think is because we had people for whom it was already too complex,

408
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 and we had people for whom they wanted things that we had deprioritized in the favor of keeping it

409
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 as uncomplicated as we could, and, like, making that series of trade-offs is incredibly difficult.

410
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 And I know that we didn't hit upon the trade-offs that everyone would have preferred,

411
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 but I think, from my perspective, we'd probably hit on the most universal set of trade-offs we could.

412
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 But I think this is a bit like when you're running an Eastercon

413
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 and you've got a choice between kind of easy to get to by public transport,

414
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 big enough to have an Eastercon, and in a place people want to go pick any two.

415
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 And, you know, that is one of those awkward situations where you always have to compromise.

416
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 The physical event version of the thing I was at this weekend

417
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 is often held at one of those ex-civil service training centers

418
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 of which I was not previously aware, and I was kind of looking at its website going,

419
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 "Ooh, ooh, you could run a nice convention here."

420
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 You mean, like, the place where you've previously run a plopter.com?

421
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Yeah, we ran Plopter at the civil service college.

422
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 I think it was still called the civil service college when we did it,

423
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 but it turns out that many large organizations that were once in the UK public sector

424
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 have a kind of training space of this kind, and I knew about a few of them

425
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 and had rejected them for one reason or another.

426
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 But this one looks quite promising.

427
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 They've mostly been public, they've been privatized now,

428
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 but most of them have been privatized in a way that still makes them quite affordable for a convention.

429
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Because they are fundamentally quite, they were quite simple places,

430
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 a bit like, because they were kind of, I think the civil service college explicitly did this,

431
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 that part of its remit was to try and give people in the civil service

432
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 who had not had the obviously helpful experience of going to a boarding school,

433
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 a sense of what going to a boarding school was like.

434
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 So the original way these places were designed as residential training centers

435
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 was to evoke a past age of British privation.

436
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 And so there's a limit to how luxurious you could make them,

437
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 and that means there's a limit to how much you can charge for them.

438
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And that's quite good because science fiction conventions are always looking for places that are kind of a bit cheap

439
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 rather than go for state of the art hotels that are too expensive.

440
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 That might have been about, yeah, I mean, I'm not really thinking,

441
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 it's going to be a long time before I run a convention in the physical world again, actually.

442
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 [Music]

443
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 I want to talk about meeting people in VR, which we did a little bit of punctuation,

444
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 but have then have done since.

445
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Sell me on, Alison.

446
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Sell me on an event I go to with my BB8 Google Cardboard,

447
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 which I had to get a friend from the US to get for me.

448
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 We used Mozilla Hubster on a VR event at punctuation,

449
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 and it was kind of a bit crap. It was okay, but it was...

450
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 I think you pronounced it wrong.

451
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 I think it's actually pronounced "Mothia" because it's Spanish.

452
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Mozilla?

453
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Mothia is possible that I've interrupted you to make a terrible joke for no very good reason.

454
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 Okay, I just, you know, I kind of like, I've been using Mozilla things since the beginning of time.

455
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Well, you know, since before John was born, maybe?

456
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 It's just much better if you assume it's a Spanish word and pronounce it "Mothia" with the ham gesture.

457
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Mothia!

458
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Mothia, Firefox.

459
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 See?

460
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Mothia, yeah, so, um, Mothia...

461
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 This is gold, it's all staying in.

462
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 You were about like five or six when Mothia came into being, I think,

463
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 so I've been using it for a very, very long time, but anyway,

464
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 so you did quite surprise me there.

465
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 But, um, Proofax said, um, oh, you will find that AltSpaceVR is much better.

466
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 And she said this enough before the convention that we could have switched, but I was like,

467
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 "But to use AltSpaceVR, people need a cap. They need a free account."

468
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 But AltSpaceVR exists, has free accounts, has two declines.

469
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 And, um, I like...

470
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 We went back last night, this was four of us, who include Max, who is a regular podcast listener,

471
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 and Proofax, who I'm not sure, is, and Lisa Conrad.

472
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 And we went back to this space, and we had a fantastic time, I think I can say,

473
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 partly because when you meet people in VR, you feel like you're in a space meeting people.

474
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 I've probably said this before, but that's kind of...

475
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 That's kind of one of the things I've been missing that I'm not getting from Zoom,

476
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 is that sense that people are in the same space as you, and at the moment,

477
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 that trick is happening for me in VR, and it is not happening for me in any of the...

478
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Any of the flat things.

479
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Um, Proofax had created a bar for us to meet, which would be big enough for, I don't know,

480
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 50 or 60, um, SF fans to hang out.

481
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 And when you arrive, it is a bit like being in a bar.

482
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 You can see that there's people over to one side talking, so you walk over to where they are.

483
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 That's kind of nice. I mean, you don't walk, you wiggle your controller, or move an arrow key or something.

484
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 Um, but then she'd got a lot of different worlds for us to visit.

485
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 And we went and visited a few other worlds, and in one of those worlds...

486
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 So there was a world with a functioning Stargate, and there was a...

487
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Um...

488
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Bridge of a spaceship and things like that.

489
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 And then in one of those worlds, some other people turned up, because what happens is, um,

490
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 people, for public worlds, you can see how many people are in them,

491
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 and because not very many people are in most of them, the four of us going into a world made it a popular world.

492
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 And so then other people would turn up, and we fell into conversation with somebody who said,

493
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 "It was like a middle-aged American man who said, 'Oh, you should come see my world, because I've got a castle with a rock club and a dungeon.'

494
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 And we went, 'Sure, let's do that in a way that, in real life, I think you're just there to say,

495
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 you would never go anywhere with somebody.'

496
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 He was like talking about his experiences of Burning Man, okay?

497
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 You know.

498
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 You're not wrong.

499
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 That is one of those situations that definitely plays out differently on the internet.

500
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 [laughs]

501
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 - His dungeon was not actually creepy, and we had an absolutely great time, and then he'd very cleverly, I think.

502
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 It turns out that one of the things you can do in old space is texture your walls by importing photographs to use as a texture,

503
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 and he'd got a photograph of him, which looked quite like his avatar.

504
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 He did a better job of looking like his avatar, and he'd got a photo of him on one of the walls,

505
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 and I was like, 'Well, that's actually, that's...'

506
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 If this was a real dungeon, that would be creepy, but in fact,

507
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 it's not particularly creepy in this context, because when you've been invited to somebody's dungeon music club,

508
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 you kind of want to know what they look like in the physical world.

509
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 And this was all...

510
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 We had a load of time...

511
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 You know, we like practiced flying, and we hung out on a pirate ship, and we just had a fantastically good time.

512
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 That's probably a little bit...

513
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 None of this stuff would be any fun on your own, but just having four or five of you doing it is enough for it to be a lark.

514
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 And again, something I've not been getting in the apocalypse, so that was quite nice.

515
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 I know that Liz obviously gets to go out and see real people in the real world, and that's something that's going to happen.

516
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 But some of us aren't going to be for a while.

517
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 VR, if you have headsets, if any of you have a headset and fancy coming and hanging out in some weird,

518
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 grandos, creepy dungeon with me, do let me know.

519
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 But it was so much fun, and it reminded me, because actually, we were talking about mods and text chat.

520
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 I'm wondering whether Jod has just logged on to Alt Space VR.

521
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 I'm riding a roller coaster, and I'm genuinely getting vertigo.

522
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 It's weird.

523
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Okay, you need to be careful about that, because you can become quite sick in these circumstances, so...

524
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Yeah, I might stop watching when I vomit.

525
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Do you want to start watching, like, just while we do the podcast, maybe?

526
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 He slightly... he slightly derailed me. See what I did there.

527
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 Ha! Yes.

528
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 You were talking about how you went to some run's dungeon where the giant picture himself on the wall,

529
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 and it was somehow not as weird as it sounds.

530
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Yeah, okay, so I do remember, and I'm going to cast one, but if you remember back in time to when we had text mods,

531
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 which we were talking about last time,

532
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 and one of the things about text mods is that it was possible to, in text mods, go off with creepy strangers

533
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 in a way that you would never do in reality as well, and go to their interesting, interesting mods that they'd set up.

534
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 But this was more of that, and more interesting, and it was all quite good fun, and we had a good time.

535
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 Well, I mean, I had a good time, and I think the others had a good time, it seemed to be.

536
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 But eventually, the other thing about VR headsets is that you could only do it for a certain amount of time,

537
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 and then you go, "No, no, no, I'm going to get my brain is frying."

538
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 If anybody has a headset out there and has not yet got involved in this tiny little bit of fandom,

539
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 then get in touch, and I'll give you the secret codes, or I'll introduce you to prove actually to give you the secret codes.

540
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Right. So can I... so I can access this, so if I have an iOS device and a Google Cardboard, I can come along?

541
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 I don't... it has Windows and Mac clients. I don't know whether it has a Cardboard client. You should check.

542
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 Okay. It's owned by Microsoft, so I think there's a good chance it doesn't have a Cardboard client.

543
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 I'm basically waiting for my wife to buy VR, because she keeps saying she wants it, and I'm like, "Well, that's very nice here."

544
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 And pointless technology things I want, I pay for it. She doesn't go splitsies with Beyond, so I'll kide.

545
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 Hopefully this is where all of that comes back to really, like, I really get Baker return away investment,

546
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 and she randomly buys a VR one day. But it's one of those things which is highly expensive,

547
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 so I've never quite been able to justify it.

548
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 Okay. So the other thing about the creepy random with the underground dungeon, and if you're listening to this...

549
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 Creepy Rambo.

550
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 By the way, you're fine, okay? He was a cool guy.

551
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 Please tell me that you didn't give him the link to our podcast, and then exclusively refer to him as Creepy Rondo.

552
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 I don't think... I mean, I think I was in there with my real name there, because I only have one online identity these days, so...

553
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 Okay.

554
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 So he could probably look me up and find the podcast. I mean, I don't think he might.

555
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 But... Well, your band from his dungeon now, I think.

556
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 But we've been... So we've been kind of wandering around his world for a little while, and he said,

557
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 "Oh, and of course I don't actually have a heads. I can't really do the flying thing, because I don't have a heads set. I'm doing this on a laptop."

558
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 And we were like, "You what?"

559
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 Oh.

560
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 So he is somebody who had actually built the whole world, just using the 2D card. He wasn't actually viewing it in VR.

561
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 So... So that's the... It's quite strange.

562
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Apparently it's all based on Unity. So theoretically, you could get any Unity 3D object in there, which...

563
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 I feel like there's quite a lot of scope there for quite exciting things.

564
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 If you wanted to, like, be Mario or some equivalent thereof, which I personally wouldn't on account of how I keep falling into bits,

565
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 and by being stomped on by Goombas, but, you know...

566
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 So yeah, I don't have a proper VR, but I've got a Google Cardboard.

567
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 If I can interact with this in any way using that, then do let me know, but it sounds like, from a quick Google, I cannot.

568
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 No, I don't have a VR headset. I am tempted to get one, but it would only be for the purposes of playing Beat Saber, so it would be on my PlayStation.

569
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 So... I still couldn't come and join you.

570
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 Beat Saber is just a game... I guarantee you'd quite enjoy hanging out at our bar.

571
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Yeah, but can I do it from a PlayStation?

572
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 Yeah, I don't know, check.

573
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 Oh, that's the thing.

574
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Anyone in my room?

575
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 Maybe not.

576
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 From my PlayStation, so I can play...

577
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 And this is the real problem.

578
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 I don't have any computer that would feasibly run a VR rig, so...

579
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 Oh, but remember, that's the whole point of the Oculus Quest, which is just standalone.

580
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 That's why I have one. I would never have one if you had to plug it into a thing.

581
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 Yeah, but can I play Beat Saber on it?

582
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 One day is manual by one.

583
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 So, but the problem is that the Star Wars Battlefront VR experience is only on PlayStation 4, but PlayStation 4 won't do the buy you've told me about, so I'd have to buy two VRs, Alison.

584
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 Two!

585
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 So if you had to choose, though, between the PlayStation Battlefront experience and the VR bar, it's gonna be the...

586
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 Hang on, did you just seriously tell me to choose between Star Wars or friendships?

587
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 Not difficult decision, Liz.

588
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 Star Wars every time.

589
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.

590
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 To be fair, it might well be that it has come out on PC since then, but it was.

591
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 I know it was a PlayStation exclusive, but yeah.

592
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 I like that the Oculus Quest apparently comes with Oculus Quest color-coded batteries.

593
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 So for those who don't know, the Oculus Quest is sort of a mostly white with black trim, and it looks very good, and it comes with two AA batteries, which are mostly white with black trim as well.

594
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 I should say this is the Oculus Quest 2, I have the Oculus Quest 1, which is Chop Liver.

595
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Ah, what?

596
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 Maybe I should get an Oculus Quest 2, just so I can repeatedly tell you to buy the second one.

597
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 It's... I'm not saying it's not gonna happen.

598
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 [laughs]

599
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 Um... Oh, I could get a Quest 2 Elite strap.

600
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 Yeah, it's complicated, John.

601
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 Right, so...

602
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 [laughs]

603
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 It's 49 pounds is what it is, Alison.

604
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 HTC... HTC Vive Oculus Rift, Rift S Goad Quest, Windows Mixed Reality in 2D mode on PC, and they have a beta-club for the 2D mode on Mac.

605
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 So although it says available wherever you are on for free, I think that doesn't include PlayStation or iOS or Android, all of which are places that you might well be.

606
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 So, no. Um... Mozilla Hubs or Mafia Hubs?

607
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 [laughs]

608
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 It's so worth it.

609
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 They've all done on the Mac.

610
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 They're so happy. They can't possibly express you.

611
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 Because every time you do it, you probably do the hand gesture, and it's beautiful.

612
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 Always.

613
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 [laughs]

614
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 Ah, I have no regrets.

615
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 Okay, no, I should look up the Mac client then. The beta.

616
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 Mafia Hubs runs in a web browser, so that might also work on devices.

617
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 Okay, good night.

618
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 Alison will send me lots of links, and there will... Alison will send me lots of links, and there will be links in the show notes, listeners.

619
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 Um...

620
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 You use Chrome on a Google Cardboard to get it to Mozilla Hubs.

621
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 Mafia Hubs!

622
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 Mafia Hubs? Okay, cool.

623
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 Good stuff.

624
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 I will not be joining you, but I am going to mention it quite a lot in order to now get Alison to do the hand gesture.

625
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 [laughs]

626
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Yeah, well, I mean, I'm kind of like...

627
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 As also seated, Mafia Netscape!

628
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 [laughs]

629
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 Ah, dearie me.

630
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 I will have to content myself with the whole going out and seeing people in person, which...

631
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 Alright, Liz.

632
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 On that bombshell! That was Episode 20 of Octa Thorpe, and it's goodbye from me.

633
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 It's goodbye from me.

634
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 And it's goodbye from me.

635
00:51:45,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 [music]

636
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 Yes, now you have a delivery.

637
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 Now, we won't mention it, but it's not Weetabix.

638
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 I thought from it that Alex Horne was behind you in a hat.

639
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 I am.

640
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 If we ever do Faddish Taskmaster, we have to get Steven to play Alex Horne.

641
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 I'm sure Steven's up for that. We don't know what to do.

642
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 Have we had to get Alison to play Greg?

643
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 Wallace.

644
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 No, Greg, have you not seen Taskmaster?

645
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 No!

646
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 Your homework is to go and see Taskmaster.

647
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 And then you will understand why we think you would make a good Greg Davis and Steven would make a good Alex Horne.

648
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 Okay, so this is like for when, in the after times, when we actually do punctuation live.

649
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 Yes, yes. I mean, it would work. But I would highly, I would say to you Alison, Taskmaster may be the best thing on British television at the moment.

650
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 Alright, and I don't think I'm exaggerating.

651
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 Okay, now that the Great British Bake Off is over, that is not actually saying a lot.

652
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 And I do not think any British shows are currently queued up in my life at all.

653
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 Watch Taskmaster.

654
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 But many, many, many non-British shows are.

655
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 How much Taskmaster do I need to watch in the busiest two weeks of my professional year?

656
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 And how much Taskmaster could I possibly leave to the two weeks between the two weeks between the final post for first class post and the second of January during which I do no work at all?

657
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 Yes. The answer to your question is yes.

658
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 I got confused with dates.

659
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 Yeah, I promise to watch Taskmaster a bit over Christmas.

660
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 And, and is it one of these shows like House of Games? Because Richard Osman was extremely funny on Stuart and Maconey.

661
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 And he was saying that House of Games, he couldn't get anyone to let him do it.

662
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 Because he wanted celebs to be on for the whole week.

663
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 And he couldn't get anyone to let him do it until Taskmaster.

664
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 And then everyone was like, "Oh, you mean like Taskmaster?" And he was like, "Yes, I've been banging on about this for years. You're nuts."

665
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 Anyway, he didn't say that because he's a very polite man on the radio.

666
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 Yeah, so basically Richard Osman was interviewed by Richard Herring on the Richard Herring Less Square Theatre podcast.

667
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 "Riholest to per."

668
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 And the thing he said is basically Taskmaster has kind of almost, has done an awful lot to reinvigorate the kind of game show genre.

669
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 Because it is the first show that has let you have a persistent panel and has demonstrated that that can actually be funny and a thing worth doing.

670
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 So yes, I think Richard Osman has mentioned this on other podcasts as well.

671
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 Taskmaster is almost infinitely better than House of Games to be fair, but...

672
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
 Oh, I quite love House of Games though, so...

673
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 While I do fucking love Taskmaster, I will say that when we were chatting earlier and we said, "Oh, we won't need very much this episode."

674
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 Because we've already got a bunch of stuff in the last one.

675
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 We are now talking about even more shit, which is definitely not going to go into podcast.

676
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 So, should we move on to something that's podcastable? Yeah.

677
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 That's all after show to be fair.

678
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:21,000

00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000

00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 Beep.
