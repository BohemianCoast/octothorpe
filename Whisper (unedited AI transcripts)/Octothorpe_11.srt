1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 I mean your living room is right here with you.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,040
 We've had a question in the chat.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,440
 Lily in Edwards asks,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,880
 "Why are you running the hospital radio in an open prison?"

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,520
 (laughing)

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,400
 - I am assuming that this is a reference to my

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,320
 blue snowball and clamp and pop filter set up.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,000
 - Well and also the fact that

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,920
 she thought that your background made it look like

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,360
 you were in an open prison.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,920
 So she thought, she thought you were recording

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,320
 from the sick bay of a prison.

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,360
 - I am recording from, this is balcony.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,240
 That's, this is balcony with, as we discovered earlier,

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,840
 pigeon proof netting.

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,520
 - Yeah, it's to keep things out, not to keep people in.

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,080
 - It does keep Liz in though.

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,840
 Liz have you ever jumped off your balcony?

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,240
 - No, because I live on the seventh floor John.

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,560
 (laughing)

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,480
 Yeah, so I'm like, I am not jumping off this balcony

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
 while in her lovely flat with this gorgeous view

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,640
 of the Thai skyline behind me.

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,400
 (dramatic music)

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,720
 (dramatic music)

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:09,720
 - Hello everyone and welcome to the very 11th episode

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,320
 of the Octa Thorpe podcast, a podcast about science fiction

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,680
 and science fiction fandom.

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,920
 I'm John Coxon.

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
 - I'm Alison Scott.

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,480
 - And I'm Liz Batty.

32
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,320
 - And we are coming to you today live from Liz's house.

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,520
 Alison is on the balcony and Liz and I are on the sofa.

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,200
 - Well, I'm on the coffee table.

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,800
 - Yeah, you're basically purchasing the coffee table

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,200
 in the middle of my living room, but that's fine John.

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,520
 You do you.

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,560
 (laughing)

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,200
 - I shall and thank you.

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,680
 And the beer here is excellent.

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,880
 So I'm drinking Nocturne by Unity,

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,680
 which is a lovely oatmeal porter

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,320
 and I'm surprised they sell it in Thailand.

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,400
 (laughing)

45
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,640
 - I am drinking two tribes Metroland, a session IPA.

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
 I am surprised they're sell it in Thailand.

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,760
 (tongue clicking)

48
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,400
 - Liz, are you drinking beer?

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,720
 - I mean, I'm drinking water,

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,280
 which they also sell in Thailand.

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,120
 So.

52
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,600
 - Fair enough.

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,560
 And yes, we are here.

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,200
 This is the last stop of Alison's guff trip

55
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,960
 on the way back from Worldcon.

56
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,520
 She's coming back from New Zealand via Thailand

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,280
 back to Wolfham Stowe.

58
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,960
 Are you tired, Alison?

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,960
 - I believe I now have a title for my virtual guff report,

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,360
 which is Time Zones, Our A Social Construct.

61
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
 (laughing)

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,600
 - That doesn't mean that is true.

63
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,320
 - So yes, I am quite tired.

64
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,680
 I feel, I think I feel less tired

65
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,640
 than I would after a regular convention,

66
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,680
 which is interesting because I do feel very tired,

67
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,320
 but I do not also have some kind of low level

68
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,400
 gastric disorder and a majestic hangover.

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,880
 And I think that's a win.

70
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,640
 So normally at the end of a convention,

71
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,560
 I'm kind of quite poorly as well as being physically

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,800
 and mentally tired.

73
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,120
 And I do not have any of that stuff.

74
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,280
 I'm just tired.

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,320
 I am, I do not know what time of day it is.

76
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,400
 I do not know what day of the week it is.

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,880
 I have no idea whether I can move back

78
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,860
 straightforwardly from New Zealand time.

79
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,640
 I don't even know what New Zealand time is.

80
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,600
 Oh, I do have to go and visit the Chatham Islands for half an hour.

81
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,440
 So I'm gonna do that.

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
 So there is one more stop on,

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,040
 there's one more kind of New Zealand stop on my tour.

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,320
 So I wasn't aware that there were any talking pigs in New Zealand.

85
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,360
 Talking pigs?

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,280
 Yeah, if you're going to chat to ham.

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,320
 I make this joke every time I go through Clap Ham,

88
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,000
 I'm like, we're applauding the pigs at Clapham Junction.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
 And Hogg the first time I did it laughed entirely too much.

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
 And so I've never stopped.

91
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,880
 So basically I blame him.

92
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,920
 So this is basically a brick joke for some different fandom.

93
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,640
 A mean, I guess.

94
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,720
 Maybe.

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,480
 So, and you are, you may be channeling Ian Sorenson.

96
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,720
 I again regard this as a great compliment.

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,520
 So I have no regrets.

98
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,040
 Oh dear, Douglas Spencer has said he does the same

99
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,840
 whenever he goes through sheet wash.

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,720
 Fair enough, fair enough.

101
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,840
 I have also been at a convention this weekend

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,520
 and a spina has been at Consi-land.

103
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,920
 And we have been getting increasingly greasy takeaways every night

104
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,400
 and drinking entirely too much.

105
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,520
 So I do have the traditional lack of vitamins

106
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,440
 and over-emboying of alcohol feeling

107
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,400
 and feel very much like the Sunday morning of a convention.

108
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,120
 Liz, how do you feel in terms of vitamins and stuff?

109
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,560
 I feel pretty good because I think at the end

110
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,680
 of the last Worldcon, I had quite a big hangover

111
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,040
 and that was entirely due to Alison Scott

112
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,760
 spending all her growths on beer in Martin's Bar and Dublin

113
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,720
 until they literally closed and turned the lights

114
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,760
 on and kicked us out.

115
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,560
 So I don't have that this time,

116
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,720
 but I will be having a beer later in solidarity.

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,960
 I have two comments to make on that.

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,080
 The first is on a point of order.

119
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,800
 I should say that as well as spending my own personal growths,

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,760
 I also went round the bar finding if anyone had growths

121
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,200
 that they did not expect to spend

122
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,800
 before the end of the evening

123
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,600
 and collecting them up and redistributing to them,

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
 to people who didn't feel they had enough beer

125
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,280
 to last till the end of the evening.

126
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,280
 And I also, at least one point in the evening,

127
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,560
 hung the treasure of Dublin 2019 upside down

128
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,320
 by his ankles until quite a lot of growths fell out

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,000
 so that I could do more redistribution of growth.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,560
 Is that the only reason I was not at Conzeland

131
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
 until the point at which they shut the door

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,920
 and turned off the lights is that I had to leave

133
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,840
 the dead dog about 50 minutes early

134
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,000
 so that I could come here and set up for this pog car.

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,840
 So I think they have actually shut,

136
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,960
 I believe that the last parties at the Conzeland,

137
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,480
 I think the discord is still open for another three hours,

138
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,960
 but I think the last parties have closed now.

139
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,160
 You'll still be able to watch the videos

140
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
 and things for a week.

141
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,480
 So what are we talking about this week, John?

142
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,760
 - Conzeland.

143
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,280
 So we're going to note at the top of this episode

144
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,000
 that we are going to talk to Alison

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,320
 about how much fun she's had at her convention.

146
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
 And I might talk a little bit about how much fun me

147
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,840
 and his panel have had doing conventions this weekend as well.

148
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,200
 We are unlikely to have a coherent

149
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,000
 and nuanced discussion about all of that,

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,560
 what happened regarding George R.R. Martin

151
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,280
 and the Hugo's and general things that were on fire

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,480
 as a result of that.

153
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,320
 We will be discussing that next episode

154
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,320
 where we have had a chance to come up with

155
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,600
 coherent thoughts, sensible thoughts, nuanced thoughts,

156
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,960
 good thoughts.

157
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,080
 But critically, thoughts that we can edit

158
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,760
 before their broadcast.

159
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,600
 - Let do.

160
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,360
 (dramatic music)

161
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,880
 - How did you find shifting time zones

162
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,720
 on your guff trip, Alison?

163
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,320
 - I do not know what time of day it is.

164
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,400
 I do not know what day of the week it is.

165
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
 I do not know.

166
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,400
 - Sunday.

167
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,880
 - It started out quite good.

168
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,800
 So I thought it was going to be quite straightforward

169
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,360
 and it was straightforward.

170
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,440
 And then we went camping,

171
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,440
 so I was combining a actual holiday in the daytime

172
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,760
 with virtually touring New Zealand and Australia

173
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,480
 in the nighttime and there weren't any hours left

174
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
 at that point.

175
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,320
 And then it went all went quite wrong.

176
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,280
 And since then, it's been a bit chaotic.

177
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,440
 - How was being in New Zealand and Wales simultaneously?

178
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,360
 Did that go well?

179
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,400
 - Both these places have sheep.

180
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,240
 - Okay.

181
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,920
 So I got out of the, you know,

182
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,400
 it's dawn in Pete Crump's farmhouse garden

183
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,120
 'cause we were camping in his field.

184
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,200
 And there's like these rolling hills and sheep.

185
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,400
 And I was like, you could almost believe you were in New Zealand.

186
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,560
 - Oh, you know, it's a good point.

187
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,760
 Okay, for enough.

188
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,080
 - So this is quite like,

189
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
 but then there was some kind of really weird things.

190
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,320
 So I was going virtually touring

191
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,440
 where Ming and Smitty were taking me around Wellington

192
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,240
 on a, as a telepresence, on their phone

193
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,560
 and pointing me at things so I could see them.

194
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
 And it was about two o'clock in the morning.

195
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,520
 And this sort of thing is quite strange.

196
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,040
 So, and yes, that was the point

197
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,760
 where it all went completely wrong.

198
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,320
 But also when I got back, even though I was here,

199
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,840
 once I was on New Zealand time,

200
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,440
 the notion of being expected to fall asleep

201
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
 at one o'clock in the afternoon

202
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,840
 when it's very sunny in the house is very active.

203
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,520
 It can no longer be explained away

204
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,320
 by going to bed late or very late

205
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,600
 or getting up very early.

206
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,200
 It really was just that you were on the opposite time

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,680
 and it's much harder.

208
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,760
 - So I kind of ended up with a couple of sleeps a day,

209
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,320
 neither of which were at all adequate

210
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,000
 and which taken together,

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,080
 did not remotely add up to eight hours

212
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,360
 or even probably five hours.

213
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,960
 - So a proper convention sleep cycle then?

214
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,320
 - I don't normally sleep in the afternoon at conventions

215
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,960
 unless I have got so exhausted

216
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,800
 that I just drop where I am.

217
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,920
 And I met Kristin, Kristin Sybert, I think her name is,

218
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,640
 who is the head of parties at Conzilas.

219
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,800
 So we spent quite a lot of time together over the weekend

220
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,400
 as I spent all the time working the party room.

221
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
 She was basically the party host for the Zoom parties.

222
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,040
 And the parties ran in three hour chunks

223
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,440
 every eight hours all weekend.

224
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,400
 So you basically had...

225
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,160
 - I really like that.

226
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,680
 'Cause this fan you mentioned that and that's a good idea.

227
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,600
 - That worked really well.

228
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,160
 They should have done it with the panels as well.

229
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,280
 So what they probably should have done

230
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,000
 was have a three hour slot of parties

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,680
 and then five hours slot of panels

232
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,200
 and possibly just a three hours slot of panels.

233
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
 And then a three hours slot of,

234
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,080
 then an hour for lunch and showers and physical exercise

235
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,520
 and actually not spending your time on your ass

236
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,640
 because the hugest difference between a five day

237
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,040
 online convention, at a five day work on,

238
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,440
 I hit 10,000 steps every day,

239
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,480
 I hit 20,000 steps most days.

240
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,400
 I get plenty of physical exercise.

241
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,080
 I normally get plenty of fresh air.

242
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,040
 A Dublin, I got so much fresh air.

243
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,760
 I was often at severe risk of being knocked over

244
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,080
 by the bloody wind.

245
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,520
 And at this convention,

246
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,200
 I literally, it is not wrong to say

247
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,120
 that I have dragged myself from my bed

248
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,840
 to my desk chair back to my bed.

249
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,280
 And one of my dear friends was talking about her

250
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,000
 extremely aged and infirmed mother

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,560
 and said she just, she spends all night in her bed

252
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,080
 and then she spends all day in a chair

253
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,880
 and she started to get bed saws and we're really worried

254
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,960
 and I'm like, okay, yeah,

255
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,160
 I should be checking for bed saws at this point.

256
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,560
 So, so I have not had very much exercise this week

257
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,280
 to put it mildly.

258
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,600
 - I have been in a similar boat from Thursday.

259
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,320
 I basically spent, well, as I've told Liz,

260
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,120
 I've spent roughly 12 to 15 hours a day

261
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,680
 playing Arkham Horror of the Card Game on my computer.

262
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,880
 - Don't look so happy.

263
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,000
 You look so happy.

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,040
 For people watching this,

265
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,120
 - It's been really great.

266
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,240
 - John just has this, he has the exact same grin

267
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,720
 that people have when they've had sex

268
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,800
 for the first time with the new partner.

269
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,040
 (laughing)

270
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,880
 - I mean, I would like to say two things.

271
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,840
 Firstly, España laughed, could hear it.

272
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,640
 Secondly, I would like you to know

273
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,680
 that I look less happy than this in that situation.

274
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,480
 I am definitely glowing right now.

275
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
 I think we can all agree.

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,040
 - Yeah, no, you really, really is looking very contented

277
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,880
 right now.

278
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
 - It's been so good.

279
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,760
 It's been so good.

280
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,880
 I had a hugely great time,

281
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,960
 but it has necessitated doing stretches at my computer,

282
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,760
 which is fun.

283
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,400
 - Yeah, I've had to do stretches at my computer.

284
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
 Sometimes I've had to stretch for beer

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,720
 and sometimes I've had to stretch for two two chips.

286
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,440
 - I see, I'm weightlifting right now.

287
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,720
 So Liz, yeah, we've talked a lot.

288
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
 How are you?

289
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,560
 - Well, I'm good and I haven't been to a convention,

290
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,600
 so I figured I would just stay quiet

291
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,480
 and react to Alison's stories of Consiland.

292
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,920
 - Does Alison's story of Consiland make you wish

293
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,600
 you had time shifted and attended Consiland?

294
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,480
 - It does a bit because the time shift for me

295
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,160
 would actually have been not too difficult.

296
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,880
 I think basically I could have time shifted

297
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,320
 by just getting up very early,

298
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,040
 but I'm not naturally a morning person.

299
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,200
 So the idea of having to get up at 6 a.m.

300
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,440
 to attend the convention seemed really grim,

301
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,760
 so I didn't do it.

302
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,040
 - I was on the program at 8 a.m.

303
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,920
 New Zealand time on the first day of the convention,

304
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,760
 which is like 9 p.m. UK time.

305
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,800
 So I had to time shift to get up

306
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,400
 to be on a program item at nine o'clock in the evening,

307
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,000
 as if it was the start of the day.

308
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,760
 And oh my God, anyway, I blame Laurie Mann,

309
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,480
 who tells me it's not her fault,

310
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,280
 but I blame her anyway.

311
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,720
 So I never, I never,

312
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,880
 that day I was on program at eight o'clock in the morning

313
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,200
 and 10 o'clock at night.

314
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,620
 (soft music)

315
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,640
 - So I have a question about the Consiland program,

316
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,200
 which I didn't look at in any great detail.

317
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,520
 I saw people doing the traditional,

318
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,200
 I could have done it better on Twitter,

319
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,760
 and I sort of mostly ignored that.

320
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,360
 But did you find that it was programmed

321
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,280
 like a traditional Worldcon in terms of like the times

322
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
 and how many panels were in each slot?

323
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,400
 Or what did you think changed compared

324
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,880
 to a physical Worldcon?

325
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,880
 - I think it was programmed very much like a normal Worldcon

326
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,200
 in that a lot of random people were put on panels,

327
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,360
 sometimes the great effect,

328
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
 and sometimes the slightly less good effect.

329
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,320
 It mostly ran in the daytime.

330
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,800
 So compared to a British con,

331
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,160
 Worldcons and American cons generally

332
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,880
 do not tend to have the programming into the evening

333
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,000
 on a range of increasingly frivolous subjects.

334
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,360
 That for me is the entire point

335
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,120
 of attending program at conventions.

336
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,120
 So, and I understand that it's important to have

337
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,520
 an important topics about the important things of the day,

338
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,760
 but I would have liked to have seen,

339
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,200
 I'm sorry I haven't a clue and things of that kind as well.

340
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,520
 But I know that I'm not going to get that.

341
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,280
 So with the day was programmed pretty thoroughly

342
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,360
 with exactly the sorts of panels,

343
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
 probably rather fewer than you would get at a real convention.

344
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,400
 But nevertheless, people went to a lot of program.

345
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,000
 People worked out that you could go to program

346
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 and slip out very easily if you don't like it.

347
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,280
 You could go to program and kind of be in the bar,

348
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,120
 having a, people had worked out that you could like man

349
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,200
 your convention table in the bar,

350
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,840
 whilst also watching things on the program,

351
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,200
 whilst also snarking to people in another chat somewhere.

352
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,280
 And I think people like that a whole lot.

353
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,520
 That was very popular.

354
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,600
 So that was that.

355
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,480
 I was on a fair number of program items,

356
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,320
 vast numbers.

357
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,160
 I saw some more because I promised people

358
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,440
 I was not going to work at the convention

359
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,760
 because they thought that if I was being the guff delegate

360
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,160
 and also running a dealers table

361
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,800
 and also being on program, I might die.

362
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,040
 Also working the convention, I might die,

363
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,760
 but it became quite clear early on

364
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,120
 that some of the areas of the convention

365
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,800
 were not quite coping.

366
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,040
 And one of these was the Zoom host role

367
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,120
 where you have somebody in the Zoom

368
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,680
 making sure that the exact thing we're not doing

369
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,600
 in this Zoom actually.

370
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,480
 We probably should have arranged somebody to do that.

371
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
 But anyway, but.

372
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,400
 - Do as I say, not as I do.

373
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,240
 - Yeah, exactly.

374
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,080
 But they needed that role and they,

375
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,440
 and they knew they needed that role

376
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,280
 and they trained people for it, but they didn't have enough.

377
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,560
 So I did a few shifts of that.

378
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,160
 So I did actually do some work on the convention,

379
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,560
 which got me to see a little bit of the kind of

380
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,760
 how things work backstage.

381
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,120
 And then the only other work I did was that

382
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,840
 there was one point where they wanted to,

383
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,120
 they had a party room set up so that ordinary members

384
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,240
 of the convention could meet Hugo finalists.

385
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,080
 And we met somebody who was very senior at the convention

386
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,000
 who had been working for like 102 consecutive hours

387
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,920
 at that point and that he just looked at us and said,

388
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,280
 I now have to go because I have to run this room

389
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,560
 for random people to meet Hugo finalists

390
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,480
 in which there will be random Hugo,

391
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,320
 random people and no Hugo finalists.

392
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,960
 And Tammy Coxon, who's the Hugo administrator

393
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,400
 and me who was the gof-goer that said,

394
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,160
 "Well, why don't we sit in your room

395
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,640
 "and you could go and actually get some sleep

396
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,800
 "or do whatever else you have to do?"

397
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,600
 And we can man that.

398
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,040
 So that was the only other work I did.

399
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,400
 And I think if there was gonna be another con like this,

400
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,280
 I would actually get in touch and say,

401
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,840
 "I'm very happy to host parties for you

402
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,920
 "if you have like official party rooms that need hosts.

403
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,440
 "This is a thing that I'm prepared to do,

404
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,280
 "provided you don't mind me being drunk when I do it."

405
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,840
 - I'm actually curious, Alison,

406
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,360
 how well did it work with all the participants on Zoom?

407
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,960
 Because there's a huge variation in whether people

408
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,040
 are sort of, you know, sound like they're on a panel

409
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,600
 from underwater somewhere or like,

410
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,040
 you can hear every single thing that's going on.

411
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,360
 - (speaks in foreign language)

412
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,080
 (laughs)

413
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,480
 - Three to people with quite good setups.

414
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,280
 So how well did it work for ConsiLint?

415
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,800
 And were people like on the whole, you know,

416
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,720
 audible and compensable or was that a big problem?

417
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,920
 - The items I was on as a panelist,

418
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,680
 we had all our panelists and I believe they were all audible

419
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,760
 and it was completely fine.

420
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,720
 And this was a non-issue for us.

421
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,000
 One of the rooms that I was in charge of as a Zoom host,

422
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,320
 we had an author who is in the class of people

423
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,240
 who probably should never be allowed near a computer

424
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,080
 and who could not get her Zoom set up

425
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,480
 and who had had quite a lot of individual tuition

426
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,120
 to help her get Zoom set up and they'd finally got it working

427
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,760
 and that, but the set up that they managed to make work,

428
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,680
 she couldn't get gallery view working on.

429
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,000
 So she insisted on loading the app as well as the website

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
 and it all went spectacularly wrong.

431
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,120
 So the poor viewers of whom there are about 30 or 40

432
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,040
 who come in to see this woman read,

433
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,480
 who's going to be nameless because this is absolutely not her fault,

434
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,720
 got 25 minutes of me trying to coach her through Zoom instead.

435
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,120
 So I think there is a,

436
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,240
 we should probably be a bit more dogmatic about

437
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,040
 we are, if you're going to be a program participant

438
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,200
 at this convention, you need to do Zoom training

439
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,920
 and we need to know that you have done it.

440
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,040
 And that Zoom training could be very short

441
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,400
 if you're obviously competent,

442
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,160
 but for the people who take longer, they need quite a lot

443
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
 of personal love and attention.

444
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,320
 In general, it was amazing.

445
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,440
 I think people forget how difficult it is to hear panelists

446
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
 and see panelists in program items,

447
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
 particularly big program items normally.

448
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,800
 I think for a lot of panels,

449
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,720
 you get a much better view of the panelists on Zoom

450
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,640
 and you get to see them in their native habitats.

451
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,840
 You see them in their studies and with their cats

452
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,240
 and this is kind of nice.

453
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,240
 I thought I quite like panels on Zoom

454
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,680
 and you can leave.

455
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,920
 If a panel's a bit boring, you can just tuck it away

456
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,680
 in a corner and do other things.

457
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,560
 And just when the person who won't stop talking,

458
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,960
 I think moderation is probably slightly harder on Zoom.

459
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,160
 I was in one panel that was terribly moderated

460
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,120
 to the point where I as one panelist said,

461
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,520
 I think it might be nice to hear from the other panelist

462
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,680
 who isn't speaking at all.

463
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,520
 I mean, and I hadn't spoken very much at that point.

464
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,880
 - Oh, Jesus.

465
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,880
 Like, 'cause I've moderated panels with people who talk a lot,

466
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,840
 mentioning their names.

467
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,520
 And like, it can be difficult to interrupt someone

468
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
 who's in full flow and it is more difficult

469
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,200
 if there is an audio delay.

470
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,480
 But like, yeah, if you're the moderator,

471
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,520
 you really need when there's a pause to be calling

472
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,720
 on the people that haven't been speaking as much.

473
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,440
 And if you're not doing that, that is what,

474
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,040
 where did you learn to moderate?

475
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,680
 This is the one concrete improvement

476
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,840
 I have made to British fandom.

477
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,560
 I suggested that Eastercons should run workshops

478
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,560
 that like did moderation roleplays for new moderators

479
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,680
 at the start of each con.

480
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,440
 And that is a thing that has been adopted.

481
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,920
 And I think it's a good idea

482
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,360
 because when I fly moderating, I had no idea how to do it.

483
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,160
 I just let Neil Gaiman talk, which as I said,

484
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,960
 that was the right choice

485
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,800
 'cause most of the room was there to hear Neil Gaiman talk.

486
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,360
 And fewer people there to hear Dave Haddock talk,

487
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,800
 although in some ways Dave was more interesting.

488
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,680
 But yeah.

489
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,440
 - Didn't I have to keep coming

490
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,480
 and frantically waving the time up signs

491
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,440
 that you've that pedal to try and get you off stage, John?

492
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,320
 - Yeah, I'd had two hours of sleep

493
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,480
 and I was still drunk

494
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,520
 and I was moderating a panel with Neil Gaiman

495
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,120
 about the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.

496
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,880
 Like, I'm a standard, I voluntarily stopped moderating

497
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,720
 that pedal.

498
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,480
 I am surprised that people didn't have to drag

499
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
 to be from the room.

500
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,080
 I was having my, I was living my best life.

501
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,320
 It was so good.

502
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,800
 I have to say that if I'm slightly surprised

503
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,720
 that at the point where you came in and frantically waved,

504
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,280
 the audience didn't hunt you down

505
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,040
 and beat you up really less.

506
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,880
 I think I could--

507
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,720
 - It was a good.

508
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,880
 - 'Cause it seems unlikely that whatever was on next

509
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,720
 was going to be more engaging

510
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,920
 than Neil Gaiman talking about the hitchhiker's guide

511
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,760
 to the galaxy, presumably a few years ago.

512
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,400
 - 2008, it was, it was the,

513
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,600
 not Olympus orbital, orbital,

514
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,360
 Eastcom in Heathrow.

515
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,720
 - I mean, he was guest of honor.

516
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,320
 So he probably had his schedule like,

517
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,160
 planned down to 10 minute intervals.

518
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
 So quite likely if he hadn't stopped his hand load,

519
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,240
 if had to come in and then try and get him

520
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,760
 to go to whatever he was doing next.

521
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,320
 So it was good for us already that John wrapped up

522
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,720
 because I was being like, what do I do now?

523
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,400
 What do you do if your panel doesn't actually get off stage?

524
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,200
 I guess in Zoom, if your panel is running over,

525
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,280
 then presumably you'll just get the, you know,

526
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,760
 this Zoom chat will shut down in one minute sign

527
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,920
 and it goes away.

528
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,680
 I went to a panel yesterday,

529
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,400
 there was a item that was scheduled for,

530
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,160
 it was originally scheduled for 10,

531
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,120
 but I think that was a mistake

532
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,400
 'cause when I looked at the schedule again,

533
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,440
 it had been moved to 11 and it said it would run 11 to 12

534
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,280
 and I was like, really?

535
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,120
 Like, what's his power?

536
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,560
 That's the last power of the day and then I can go to sleep.

537
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,120
 And then at 12, they were like,

538
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,320
 oh, we're supposed to wrap up now,

539
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,600
 but like, there's nothing else on the schedule for a while.

540
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,440
 So we'll just keep going because there's no,

541
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,240
 there's no one to stop you.

542
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,560
 And that meant I was like, oh no,

543
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,320
 I want this to go to bed.

544
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,720
 So I ended up like, it's finally asleep next to me,

545
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
 like on my iPad with my earphones in,

546
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,640
 in the dark, wishing they would stop doing up,

547
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,440
 well, no, 'cause it's a great Arkham horror trivia,

548
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,280
 don't get me wrong.

549
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,600
 But I was like, I always hope it could go to bed, guys.

550
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,680
 But it was a very good stream, so.

551
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,280
 - I have to say, there are some things

552
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,080
 that Kansilin did quite bad.

553
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,800
 So they, I think they'd fail to realize

554
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,880
 that you can't just uncontrolled,

555
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,040
 I can meet you like this where you're working

556
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,480
 on a Zoom basic account.

557
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,320
 So you've got 20 or 30 or 40 people in,

558
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,160
 but it's a panel with a discussion angle.

559
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,800
 That really needs to be set up with, you know,

560
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,720
 everyone else with video off an audio off

561
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,400
 and questions in chat and quite formalized,

562
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,680
 because the sort of quite come and go discussion

563
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,680
 that you might have in a program room in that circumstance

564
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,640
 is not gonna work on Zoom,

565
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,120
 because Zoom, as we all know, Bob,

566
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,800
 fails from groups of more than about 10.

567
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,720
 It stops being fun.

568
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,400
 - Turkler Spencer says in the chat

569
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,240
 that big group discussions on Zoom are very bad

570
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,640
 for hard of hearing people, and I can imagine that being true.

571
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,560
 But I think that the other, the flip side of that

572
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,880
 is obviously small group discussions

573
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,600
 where people aren't talking over each other

574
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
 are presumably much easier.

575
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,040
 I am not, I am very, very slightly hard of hearing

576
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,840
 in that I don't, like, if I go and get a hearing test,

577
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,160
 I won't be recommended to get a hearing aid,

578
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,840
 but I can't hear stuff like crickets,

579
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,040
 like it's brand new, you can hear things,

580
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,480
 I just can't hear when we go walk.

581
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,320
 She's like, listen to that.

582
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,920
 I'm like, there's no sound there,

583
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,480
 it's brand new, what are you talking about?

584
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,480
 - I was going to say the good thing about Zoom meetings

585
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,120
 that Conziland did was that they were quite focused on,

586
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,280
 this is how long the meetings will last,

587
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,280
 this is how long you've got until the next meeting comes in.

588
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,440
 They slightly, they made it a bit hard for reading

589
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,000
 because the readings, the readings were 25 minutes

590
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,600
 with five minutes to turn the room round

591
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,440
 and I can tell you that was quite the tricky thing,

592
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,880
 particularly as you have one author

593
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,920
 and if they can't manage Zoom, it's very hard.

594
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,960
 But for the panels, it was mostly the things

595
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,480
 that they expected to attract a lot of people

596
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,760
 running webinar format with an understanding

597
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,880
 that the webinars could run over if they liked

598
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,760
 because there was only one webinar every two hours.

599
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,440
 - Yeah, so there was a program in each time slot every hour

600
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
 but they had two separate Zoom accounts

601
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,120
 for each program room.

602
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,160
 So you do webinar one and then webinar two in the same room.

603
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,840
 Yeah, so it looked seamless to the members

604
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,560
 that they just went into a room.

605
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,840
 But in fact, as you went through the door to the room,

606
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,040
 you were seamlessly transported to one of two rooms,

607
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,720
 one of which contained a lady

608
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,600
 and one of which contained a tiger.

609
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,200
 No, different rooms.

610
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,760
 Okay, neither of you got that joke.

611
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,120
 Hopefully someone in the audience got that joke.

612
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,600
 I can hear that someone in the audience got that joke

613
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,560
 and I think they were in front.

614
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,720
 - Because Paniya says that we're young.

615
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,000
 No, it was a span of your chuckling

616
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,520
 and coming through my mind.

617
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,440
 - And Roman has said, "Nice joke, thank you."

618
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,520
 And some of Joe has said, "I want the tiger room."

619
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,880
 So okay, it was a, I promise you it was a good joke

620
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,480
 even though you two didn't get it.

621
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,760
 This is one of the problems with Zoom

622
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,280
 for people who do any sort of comedy

623
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,120
 is that that lack of reaction is very distressing

624
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,800
 that you kind of go, was I just not witty?

625
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,640
 - No, and you can't, 'cause I've given seminars

626
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,520
 on Zoom professionally.

627
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,240
 And I think the problem is with,

628
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,320
 yeah, the problem with that

629
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,560
 of audience reaction is you can't tell.

630
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,160
 And especially like, I'm just looking at my slide.

631
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,720
 I can't see any of the faces of the people I'm talking to.

632
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,120
 And I'm like, I have no idea

633
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
 if people are struggling with the concepts

634
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,720
 I'm going through.

635
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,200
 No idea if they're enjoying the little bits

636
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,600
 of daffness I'm putting in.

637
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,760
 Like it is really hard to give talks on Zoom.

638
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,160
 I imagine as an author doing a reading

639
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,000
 it must be even more difficult

640
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,600
 because ultimately on my slide,

641
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,320
 I got some pictures of graphs

642
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,720
 and people could look at the graphs and be like,

643
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,680
 "It's a graph."

644
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,080
 But like as an author, you gotta convey emotion and stuff.

645
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,400
 And that must be tricky.

646
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
 - Yeah, it's really hard to try and teach people over Zoom

647
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,160
 because you can't see if they're falling behind.

648
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,520
 I'll see if they're sort of looking worried and like,

649
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,400
 "Yes, and Zoom's kind of got some reaction things

650
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,320
 "with like go faster and go slower."

651
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,320
 And yes, and it's possible that those could be used for React.

652
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,520
 Facebook Live has little React emojis

653
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,560
 that float up the screen as you're doing your Facebook Live.

654
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,920
 But I just want you to know that I have now done a Facebook Live

655
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,360
 and it was very horrible.

656
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,440
 So I'm not sure I'm gonna do another of those.

657
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,560
 - Zoom has them as well.

658
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,280
 I can click on go faster and go slower.

659
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,120
 - Yeah.

660
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,440
 - Oh, we have votes for go faster, go slower.

661
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,840
 - Yes, me and Liz are telling you to do one of each.

662
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,000
 So please say each word very quickly,

663
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
 but with long pauses in between.

664
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,520
 - Like this, maybe this is really...

665
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,040
 - Yes, excellent.

666
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,280
 I'm gonna turn off my go faster 'cause this is not.

667
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,600
 - I turned them on off.

668
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,920
 - Okay, that's a bit better, right?

669
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,360
 - I like the fact that you went high pitched

670
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,720
 like I was fast forwarding your audio

671
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,960
 in an old rubbish music player.

672
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,040
 That was excellent.

673
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,920
 - Yes, that's how I do fast forward, obviously.

674
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,960
 I'm thinking I'm perky.

675
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,040
 - This is gonna be very confusing to our listeners

676
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,680
 who listen on three times speed.

677
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,000
 I just wanna point out.

678
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,240
 (laughing)

679
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,520
 - Yes, yes.

680
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,760
 Oh my goodness.

681
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,800
 Yes, no, please.

682
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,760
 I'm crazy Dave and Max right in and tell us of 3X speed

683
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,640
 whether or not Alice in talking fast forward

684
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,840
 is comprehensible.

685
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,640
 'Cause if it is, you are super powered.

686
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,480
 - They can always slow it down for those bits.

687
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,880
 They're slowing it down for my bits anyway, I'm sure.

688
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:56,080
 So one of the problems with parties at Zoom,

689
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,160
 so they had a party suite and what they did

690
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,800
 was they created a 500 person party room

691
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,600
 for which each party had one breakout room.

692
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,320
 So that meant that if you were, say, running a party,

693
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,160
 and I ran two parties in these spaces over the weekend,

694
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,680
 you just had a kind of uncontrollable room.

695
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,400
 And as anyone who knows of me knows,

696
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,080
 I run Zoom parties quite a lot,

697
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,480
 and I run them as a managed set of breakout rooms

698
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,200
 so that with the idea that each room ends up

699
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
 with five to 10 people in it,

700
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
 and when it gets bigger than that,

701
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,480
 we kind of encourage people to break it into smaller rooms

702
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,920
 because we find that those are the,

703
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,600
 I find that those are the optimum.

704
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,440
 Somebody asked me what was the optimum number

705
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,200
 of people in a room?

706
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,520
 And it kind of depends how many of the sort of introverts

707
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,680
 who like to sit in a corner and not say anything you've got

708
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,240
 because you can have quite a lot of those in your Zoom room

709
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,240
 as well as the loud-mouthed people who want to talk all the time,

710
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,840
 but you could probably only have about five or six

711
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,880
 of the loud-mouthed people who want to talk all the time.

712
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,440
 Or two if they're Lillian.

713
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,880
 - Oh, is Spania as one of the Lillian group

714
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,600
 or the Alison group?

715
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,800
 Maybe they're all women, there must be some men.

716
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,320
 - Oh no, yeah, it's Spania came down and said,

717
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,040
 "Alicein's first party at the Zoom was like 50, not 50,

718
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,400
 but like some huge number of people are like,

719
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,240
 how did that work?

720
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,080
 Did anyone get a word in it?"

721
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,880
 And well, I did, obviously.

722
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,280
 I was like, "Oh yeah, that makes sense."

723
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,680
 (laughing)

724
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,920
 - It was actually, so I went to, I said,

725
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,480
 I thought we had 37 at peak.

726
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,320
 - Blindly.

727
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,480
 - And the party team said, "No, no, no,

728
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,720
 you never went over 25."

729
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,160
 And I was like, "I had 37 at peak."

730
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,200
 But I, yeah, it's fine.

731
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,440
 It's still clearly too many.

732
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,000
 But people were happy, people were fine, I think.

733
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,520
 And then we went down to a manageable number

734
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,400
 and it was all good.

735
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,680
 And then the second party, which was not the Guff party,

736
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,800
 it was the Fanny McFanny's party had fewer.

737
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,520
 It had a kind of very stable, agreeable number

738
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,560
 of people all evening, so that was quite good.

739
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,080
 I still felt that I would have been happier

740
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,880
 if I'd had three or four breakout rooms to look after.

741
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,680
 And then I could have moved people around

742
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,840
 and then popped in to make sure they were happy

743
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,480
 the same way I would normally do it.

744
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,320
 - So were there any absolutely colossal parties?

745
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,760
 Like, I'm not sure which one you hosted

746
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,560
 other than Fanny McFanny's, but you know,

747
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,800
 I did like Chai Khan or Glasgow in 2024

748
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
 have colossal parties and how did they work?

749
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,880
 - No, I ran, oh sorry, I ran three parties

750
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,080
 'cause I ran a party for Glasgow.

751
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,760
 And again, we had about kind of 20.

752
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,240
 I think a lot of the members of the convention

753
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
 did not find the party spaces.

754
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,080
 - Right.

755
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,240
 - Yeah, that's a problem.

756
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,840
 - And some of the members of the convention

757
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,600
 who did find the party spaces kind of

758
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,080
 were expecting more structured parties.

759
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,880
 I don't think they'd realized that parties

760
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,360
 assisted of people sitting in a room drinking beer

761
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,400
 and chatting about random stuff stuff.

762
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,680
 And then there were a couple of parties

763
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,920
 that were almost like book discussion groups

764
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,360
 put into a party space.

765
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,000
 And then I think eventually the filters

766
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,080
 took a kind of a filming space to kind of do

767
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,920
 the sort of film that you can do on Zoom,

768
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,200
 which is where everybody shuts up

769
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,760
 and listens to one person sing.

770
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,400
 - So I have a question about how Conzil and diddle this.

771
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,160
 So I know that like several of the parties

772
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,080
 were basically just a single breakout room

773
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,560
 for anyone who is in that party.

774
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,840
 So like Glasgow in 2024 had like one breakout room

775
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,400
 for the Glasgow in 2024 party,

776
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,280
 which is not necessarily how I would have got

777
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,240
 about a stroke train there.

778
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,000
 But on the, so the convention I am attending

779
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,400
 does not have a Zoom component.

780
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,800
 It has a Discord and then it has the different panels

781
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,600
 and stuff are streamed on Twitch or YouTube

782
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,120
 and you just like go along.

783
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,880
 So there's no Zoom stuff happening.

784
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,320
 But it has a feature where in the Discord

785
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,880
 you can create new rooms in the Discord to hang out in.

786
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,480
 There is a basically you draw a voice channel

787
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,000
 and it automatically opens a new voice channel for you

788
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,520
 and kicks you out into that.

789
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,720
 And you can put video on, you can play a game.

790
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,800
 So it's really good for like playing pickup games.

791
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,880
 Is that something that Conzil and would doing?

792
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,840
 And do you think that would have worked better?

793
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,360
 - How many people were at the Arkham Horror Convention?

794
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,960
 - Like much fewer, many, many fewer.

795
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,800
 - Yes.

796
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,400
 So this is what you would do

797
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,760
 if you were running a small friendly convention.

798
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,160
 What happened was that they experimented briefly

799
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,920
 in one of their test runs with letting people

800
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,600
 make their own Discord chats

801
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,880
 and it all went wrong for them.

802
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,800
 They, their quote was it got very, very messy, very fast.

803
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,200
 And part of this is that Conzil and had a notion

804
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,200
 that they needed to have a way to police Conzil and space.

805
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,760
 So party rooms had to have a moderator

806
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,120
 and if you had a, if you had a table,

807
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,240
 I.E., a Discord chat for your fan group,

808
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,840
 you were supposed to moderate what went on in there.

809
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,240
 They could have done a lot more there

810
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,320
 to make it easier for people to create,

811
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,160
 do things with their own tribes.

812
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,000
 And there were many Discord video channels in the bar

813
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,400
 and I think by the last day they'd,

814
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,440
 they'd opt that to about 20.

815
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,280
 - Okay.

816
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,200
 - So those video channels in the bar

817
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,880
 did kind of act like bar tables

818
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,720
 'cause you could see who was all in them

819
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,560
 and you could spot somebody you knew

820
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,200
 in one of those conversations and then join it.

821
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,320
 - So we, we speculated when we were speculating

822
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,240
 several weeks ago about how Conzil would work,

823
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,040
 about how is it gonna work for the sort of people

824
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,240
 who if they come into the con bar might find it hard

825
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,320
 to sit down and have a quiet chat

826
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,600
 because there's someone that everyone wants to talk to.

827
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
 Now, how would that work?

828
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,160
 How did that work in the Conzil and Discords?

829
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,560
 Or did you see someone join a table and everyone,

830
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,600
 ooh, and suddenly join their Discord chat

831
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,200
 and they had 50 people?

832
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,800
 Or in practice were those people

833
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,880
 just not joining the Discord beer chats?

834
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,920
 - Okay. So there was a lot of different,

835
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,960
 there were a lot of private zims going on.

836
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,080
 A lot of the people who you think of as being more famous,

837
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,400
 well, for a start off a lot of the people

838
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,880
 who think of as being more famous

839
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,800
 weren't actually at the convention.

840
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,080
 So there's some of that.

841
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,680
 I think quite a lot of US and UK authors were not there

842
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,200
 for whatever reason somewhere.

843
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,160
 - I guess if your primary reason for going to WorldCon

844
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,000
 is to hobnob a network professionally,

845
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,640
 I can see why an online convention

846
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,920
 would not represent a good opportunity to do that.

847
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,360
 - I think you can still form good connections

848
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,760
 with people at online conventions.

849
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,160
 I think I've been doing that.

850
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,000
 Both on my trip and at the convention,

851
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,960
 I've made lots of new friends. It's fine.

852
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,080
 I suspect that there were a set of zims

853
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,000
 to which we, Hoipaloy, were not privy.

854
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,280
 'Cause I wasn't getting access to,

855
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,360
 obviously there were less and less of Discords

856
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,560
 I wasn't necessarily seeing.

857
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,800
 I obviously have chats with some of those people,

858
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,280
 but I suspect there will have been

859
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,360
 like the Zoom equivalent of the stuff was sweet.

860
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,960
 So just in the same way as it's a real WorldCon,

861
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,560
 you might find that authors don't tend to be in the bar

862
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,640
 the way they would be at the EasterCon.

863
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,120
 I think that's also true.

864
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:06,760
 - How many WorldCons have you attended, Alison?

865
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,400
 - Are you counting this one?

866
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,240
 - Yes.

867
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,360
 - 11, this is my 11th WorldCon.

868
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,560
 - Where did this one rank on the list?

869
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,440
 - Oh, that's such a good question

870
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,160
 because not at the bottom.

871
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,280
 Right.

872
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,760
 I think it takes a little while to get into WorldCon

873
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,600
 and really get a hang of how to do them.

874
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,960
 So I quite, I quite enjoyed myself.

875
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,480
 I've had a really good time and it's good.

876
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,400
 I mean, last year at Dublin,

877
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,280
 the convention where I only got,

878
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,160
 there was one night that I didn't get thrown out of the CCD.

879
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,000
 The previous night I stayed up drinking

880
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,320
 with Caroline Mullen and her daughter until 4 a.m.

881
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,400
 And as a result, the following night

882
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,760
 I could only stay up till midnight

883
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,080
 and couldn't, couldn't get thrown out of the CCD.

884
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,120
 But that was the only night.

885
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,800
 I did get thrown out the other four nights of the convention

886
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,480
 and I feel that that's all you really need.

887
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,360
 What more than you want is that every night you go,

888
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,800
 you're having sufficiently good a time

889
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
 that at the point where they round everyone up and say,

890
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,440
 "Ain't you lot got homes to go to?"

891
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,000
 You go, "Oh, I suppose I do really, I'll see you tomorrow."

892
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 - At the Dublin WorldCon,

893
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 we had a slightly,

894
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,560
 it's spany and I had a slightly different experience

895
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,960
 'cause there was a great like,

896
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,040
 deli/bakery place around the corner from our digs

897
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,760
 and they shut at 3.30,

898
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,280
 but they sold pizza out of a whole little wall at like 3 a.m.

899
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,200
 So we would leave slightly early every night

900
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,400
 so we could go and eat delicious, delicious pizza.

901
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,440
 I like, yeah. - Absolutely.

902
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,680
 - And I will put a picture in the chapter out

903
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,440
 'cause I do, I took a picture of the pizza.

904
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,480
 - I have been being rather glass-hoft full

905
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,400
 for the last three weeks

906
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,680
 and people have kind of gone,

907
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,680
 "Oh, this is all right, but it's not like a real con."

908
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,280
 And I keep thinking,

909
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,440
 "Have you forgotten how much time you spent in Dublin in a queue?"

910
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,200
 - That's fair, it is fair.

911
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,480
 - So that's a really interesting question

912
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,200
 because queuing at normal world cons

913
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,280
 is a very powerful motivator in saying,

914
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,240
 "Ah, sod this, I'm not going to programme

915
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,600
 "and returning to the bar to drink more with your friends."

916
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,960
 Did you find that your like ratio

917
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,120
 of socialising to programme changed

918
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,880
 and do you think that people like went to all the programme

919
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,360
 they wanted to go to as a result

920
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,760
 didn't socialise as much as they usually would

921
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,840
 and ended up being like,

922
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,160
 "Oh, I didn't see my friends as much."

923
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,400
 Or do you think that's not?

924
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,760
 - I had a, well, a lot of people,

925
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,880
 people's friends weren't necessarily there as much.

926
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,720
 - That's true.

927
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,320
 - I had a theory that before this started

928
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,400
 that the convention would not quite get the social spaces right.

929
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,080
 I think that theory is confirmed.

930
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,600
 I getting those social,

931
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,560
 so they did some things right, for example.

932
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,800
 They had a programme-discord chat

933
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,680
 for every programme room,

934
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,560
 but not every programme room, but many programme rooms.

935
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,440
 There was a discord chat

936
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,560
 that afterwards to match it.

937
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,160
 So you would get thrown out of your Zoom

938
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,840
 and then there would be a place in the bar

939
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,480
 for you to go and have a text chat.

940
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
 And unfortunately, they could probably have done

941
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,360
 with a video chat associated with each of those as well,

942
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,640
 but they had a text chat associated with each of those.

943
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,560
 And I think that was quite good

944
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,880
 in terms of carrying on discussions,

945
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,720
 exchanging links, forging friendships.

946
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,760
 I think they could have done with more

947
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,920
 kind of generic meet-up things.

948
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,680
 I said, I don't think we haven't got the social spaces

949
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,400
 sorted yet, especially for such a big convention.

950
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,880
 And I think there is a risk

951
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,640
 that these online conventions will get bigger.

952
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,360
 I spoke to numerous people over the weekend

953
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,600
 who were there because they had always wanted to go

954
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,600
 to a worldcon, but their geographical location means

955
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,280
 that it is impossible for them to ever get to one.

956
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,720
 Social spaces, it got better through the weekend.

957
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,080
 So I found, and I think that's often true at the Worldcon,

958
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,600
 that you kind of don't quite know how to find your social spaces

959
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
 at the beginning of a Worldcon.

960
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,440
 And then it, after a bit, you know where you're going to find

961
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,040
 the people you want to chat to.

962
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,160
 I had to work quite hard to find social spaces at this con

963
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,400
 because a lot of what I think of as my bread and butter

964
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,240
 social life was not at the con.

965
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,080
 So all the people that I automatically end up

966
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,000
 in a bar chatting to because they're my mates,

967
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,880
 none of those, I think, sorry if you were,

968
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,280
 but the, I mean, there are a few in here,

969
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,280
 but the vast majority of the people who I think of as my

970
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,600
 regular mates were not at this con.

971
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,200
 So that meant that they weren't there to talk to.

972
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,400
 And so you have to do more work.

973
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,520
 I think we need to say this every week,

974
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,080
 the fact that they managed to turn the convention

975
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,320
 into a virtual convention, the time they did

976
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,760
 with as few things going wrong as did go wrong

977
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,680
 is an absolute bloody marvel.

978
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,960
 They stitched together a ton of different stuff

979
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,080
 to make it happen.

980
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,720
 It all more or less worked.

981
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,320
 Those of us that went, well, I certainly had a fantastic time

982
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,200
 and I think a lot of other people had a fantastic time.

983
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,560
 I wanted to say something else that was much better

984
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,680
 than we could possibly have imagined,

985
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,440
 which is that we ran a fan fund auction.

986
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,040
 We were like, we are not going to make any money.

987
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,840
 It is going to be a bit of a disaster.

988
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,280
 We ran it in Zoom.

989
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,200
 - Yeah, no, I saw that.

990
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,800
 You made like a thousand pounds?

991
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,880
 - We made 2000 New Zealand dollars.

992
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,960
 A lot of which was due to some very marvelous lots.

993
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,480
 I have to mention Esta McCallum Stewart and James Shields.

994
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,120
 Esta gave us two shawls.

995
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,520
 I think we're going to have Esta knitting

996
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,640
 for the fan funds for the rest of time now, if she doesn't mind.

997
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,120
 So she had two shawls that they went for a lot of money.

998
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,520
 And James Shields custom printed us dice

999
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,840
 with convention logos.

1000
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,800
 So like a D20 with the Conzila logo instead of the 20.

1001
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,520
 And oh my goodness.

1002
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,760
 You know, if he wanted to set up a business doing this,

1003
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,800
 he could probably do this at this point.

1004
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,960
 There were loads of people in the auction

1005
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
 just for that one lot.

1006
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,840
 And then Erin Underwood, my Duff counterpart,

1007
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,120
 had hit up a load of authors for like story critiques

1008
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,840
 and Zoom calls and things of that sort.

1009
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,680
 The fan funds auction ran so well

1010
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,240
 that I have a plan to run a kind of golf party

1011
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,080
 at some point.

1012
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,920
 So you're on warning here.

1013
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,440
 It'll be like the other golf parties,

1014
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,120
 but it'll be a party.

1015
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,560
 Everyone will be invited.

1016
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,040
 And then after about an hour of drinking and socializing

1017
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,040
 on Zoom, it will seamlessly turn into an auction

1018
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,080
 where we spend an hour shaking you down for money.

1019
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,280
 And then we'll go back and party

1020
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,120
 for the rest of the evening.

1021
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,880
 Does that seem like a reasonable way to spend a evening?

1022
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,720
 - Oh yeah.

1023
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,000
 And it's very important we get people drunk

1024
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 before we ask for their money.

1025
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,360
 So that is a sensible order of operations.

1026
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,560
 - So it was sufficiently, and we'll do the same thing there.

1027
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,440
 We'll get a load of lots and we'll get them on a website

1028
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,320
 so that people could go, oh my goodness,

1029
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,160
 I want to go to that

1030
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,400
 because I want to bid on this thing that is unique and special.

1031
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,920
 - Do you think that a future real world con

1032
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,240
 should have an online track?

1033
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,520
 - I think it is much harder than people think.

1034
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,200
 The reason this convention was a success

1035
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,760
 was that everyone was at home and we are all nerds

1036
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,680
 and we all pretty well have jolly good internet

1037
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,000
 and all the equipment we need at home.

1038
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,960
 And if what you did was put everybody into a hotel

1039
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,360
 and then said, oh, and we've got a hybrid track,

1040
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,960
 then at that point we would destroy the convention's

1041
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,720
 Wi-Fi in a spectacular way.

1042
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,440
 I don't think panels made up of three people in real life

1043
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,600
 and one person online would necessarily work.

1044
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,160
 I mean, I think it's worth thinking about.

1045
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,040
 I think every convention, I will say this right now,

1046
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,760
 if you're running a convention, you should have a Discord,

1047
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,120
 you should open it today,

1048
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,720
 you should encourage your members to join it,

1049
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,760
 you should have chat rooms,

1050
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,200
 you should start to create the social space

1051
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,920
 for your convention straight away

1052
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,040
 or certainly well before the convention.

1053
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,000
 I've never understood why conventions don't.

1054
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,120
 I mean, initially I assumed,

1055
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,200
 but initially I never understood why they didn't have slacks

1056
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,360
 and now Discord has become what Discord has become.

1057
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,800
 I now wonder why they don't have Discord

1058
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,440
 'cause I'm like, this is like Twitter,

1059
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,440
 but it doesn't have a lot of awful stuff

1060
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,720
 about what's happening in real life on it

1061
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,320
 and it doesn't need me to be on Twitter.

1062
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,560
 I can actually read all the messages.

1063
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,680
 So I just, I think in so many ways

1064
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,040
 it would be a very good idea.

1065
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,440
 And you could have an announcements channel

1066
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,200
 which could be the new?

1067
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,760
 - Less that sees, not zero Nazis.

1068
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,320
 Oh, and also you could just say

1069
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,960
 that the code of conduct,

1070
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,920
 the code of conduct applies to all the spaces

1071
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,160
 in the Discord all of the time,

1072
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,920
 which you cannot do with Twitter.

1073
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,200
 - I think that actually is not necessarily an issue,

1074
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,800
 but certainly if you decide to bring everything in-house

1075
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,240
 on your Discord, then you have to commit

1076
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,400
 to maintaining the code of conduct on your Discord.

1077
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,400
 So you suddenly add a lot of work for yourself

1078
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,560
 where essentially you need people watching

1079
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,960
 all the messages on the Discord.

1080
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,400
 - I have a question about that,

1081
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,080
 which is do you think that policing your members on Twitter

1082
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,000
 where you don't have any power is easier

1083
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,800
 than policing them on Discord where you do?

1084
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,320
 Because I think if you had a Discord,

1085
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,440
 you would be able to say the COC applies to our Discord.

1086
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,520
 We actually have the tools to enforce that.

1087
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,880
 But as Doug pointed out,

1088
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,160
 the code of conduct for resisting conventions

1089
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,520
 already cover their Twitters and their Facebooks.

1090
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,560
 So you're already having to do that.

1091
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,760
 So I'm not convinced it adds a lot of work

1092
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,120
 that's not already being done.

1093
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,560
 - Also, you just have a listener function.

1094
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,400
 You say to people,

1095
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,800
 "If you see anything that's troubling you,

1096
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,200
 "tag listener and we'll come and have a look at it."

1097
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,360
 And that's, so it's actually,

1098
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,880
 it's not that you have to read everything.

1099
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,440
 It's that if somebody sees a problem,

1100
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,960
 they can bounce in a mod.

1101
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,600
 And that doesn't seem to me to be ludicrous.

1102
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
 And before the convention, you can say,

1103
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,360
 "It might take us 24 hours to come and look at your thread

1104
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,000
 "because it's before the convention

1105
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 "and we're all very chill right now."

1106
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,280
 - When everything is in-house,

1107
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,800
 people will have an expectation

1108
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,680
 that you will be able to react much faster.

1109
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,400
 - That might be a good point.

1110
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,640
 I will also say that I think the Discord

1111
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,640
 is a very good opportunity to finally do something sensible

1112
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,520
 with virtual or digital or online newsletter.

1113
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,720
 That isn't just putting a PDF on a webpage.

1114
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,840
 Because I think making an RSS feed or a blog

1115
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,800
 of the newsletter doesn't really work

1116
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,960
 in the same way that having a physical newsletter

1117
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,120
 at a con does,

1118
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,120
 and I wouldn't advocate for removing a physical letter

1119
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,960
 at a con,

1120
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,920
 but being able to have a Discord announcements channel

1121
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,360
 where you can have the newsletter team posting

1122
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,480
 in real time as they get news items

1123
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,280
 would be a revelation for how

1124
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,680
 at con communications and publications are done.

1125
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,280
 And as someone who's always been a little bit

1126
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,840
 a nerd about those sorts of things,

1127
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,760
 I would very much like to see this happen.

1128
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,440
 And in fact, I will email Diana afterwards

1129
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,080
 and volunteer to do it for 2021's EasterCon.

1130
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,440
 - Can I just check?

1131
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,120
 Are you saying your

1132
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,480
 actually offered to run the Discord?

1133
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,640
 - For a Eastern Con 2021.

1134
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,560
 - Yeah, if you're gonna set a Discord up for them,

1135
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,400
 yeah, that would be great.

1136
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,680
 I think everyone would love it.

1137
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,000
 I think people would love it right now

1138
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,240
 while they're all kind of a fallout from Concealand.

1139
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,520
 I think it would be great.

1140
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,160
 Anyway, so I want to say something about

1141
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,200
 the Concealand newsletter, which is,

1142
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,520
 oh my God.

1143
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,360
 (laughs)

1144
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,720
 Oh my God.

1145
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,200
 So they did this thing where they basically said,

1146
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,400
 how we're gonna run newsletter is,

1147
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,640
 if you want something in the newsletter,

1148
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,480
 you write it to this thread

1149
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,720
 and we'll put it in the newsletter.

1150
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,680
 So the newsletter was a bare dump

1151
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,800
 from a random Discord chat.

1152
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,640
 And it reads like that.

1153
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,240
 And it's, this is actually shocking.

1154
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,120
 But I mean, I think if you had a Discord and you got,

1155
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,400
 so I don't think everyone was on it.

1156
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,680
 I think maybe only 60% of the fans

1157
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,160
 that Concealand were on the Discord, maybe.

1158
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,800
 And the number actively on the Discord

1159
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,880
 might have been a bit lower than that.

1160
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,840
 So there's a kind of getting people to take the technology,

1161
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,000
 to actually get involved in the technology there,

1162
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,600
 that we need to help with.

1163
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,280
 (laughs)

1164
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,200
 - On the subject of letters of comment,

1165
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,600
 we have some letters of comment.

1166
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,360
 We have a meme of comment from España Sheriff.

1167
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,960
 If you are listening to the podcast,

1168
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,760
 I will have put this picture in the show notes

1169
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,320
 so you can go and look at the meme.

1170
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,200
 But yes, this is her based on us getting very meta

1171
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,600
 in our last episode.

1172
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,800
 So, yup, that is a fact.

1173
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,920
 - Ah, I just need to say this is much more what I'm after

1174
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,720
 in a podcast than the people talking about books with movies.

1175
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,880
 I'm sorry about that.

1176
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,840
 (laughs)

1177
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,440
 - So, Hog sent us an email, or sorry,

1178
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,480
 sent me a text message,

1179
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,040
 asking if I'd heard of the New Games Journalism.

1180
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,200
 So, the New Games Journalism is a thing put forward

1181
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,720
 by Kieran Gillan about 15 years ago now,

1182
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,920
 in which he kind of talked about

1183
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,600
 what is the added value that you get

1184
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,360
 from having someone who is actually good at writing,

1185
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,280
 talking about, in this case, video games,

1186
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,400
 as opposed to just getting someone random

1187
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,600
 to play the game and write what they thought about it,

1188
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,080
 and then move on to the next game that you give them to play.

1189
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,720
 And he made an argument that actually

1190
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,480
 the missing link there is when you review games

1191
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,040
 or talk about games, you need to be linking,

1192
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,440
 you need to be linking what you're talking about

1193
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,120
 to what people feel when they're playing games,

1194
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,040
 and contextualizing it in how they might have felt

1195
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,160
 when they're playing other games,

1196
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,080
 and actually linking it to the human condition

1197
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,240
 in a way that just playing the game

1198
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,720
 and then talking about what the game is

1199
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,080
 doesn't necessarily do.

1200
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,680
 And that kind ties into what we were saying last episode

1201
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,280
 about the difference between a podcast

1202
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,720
 that just literally reads a book

1203
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,080
 and then talks about the plot,

1204
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,960
 and a podcast that kind of contextualizes the genre

1205
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,560
 in terms of reading different books.

1206
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,880
 And I had used the example of Shabbat sit down

1207
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,440
 in the gaming world as a way of doing that.

1208
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,960
 And that is an example of the new games journalism.

1209
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,520
 So there will be a link to Kieran Gillens' manifesto

1210
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,280
 in the show notes.

1211
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,280
 - I am going to say that both Liz Batty and I do know,

1212
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,600
 I hope Liz will remember this and not look blank,

1213
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,320
 but we do know about Kieran Gillens' new games journalism

1214
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,760
 because about 2017, how long ago was in the autumn of 2017,

1215
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,280
 about three or earlier than that, 2016, 2015,

1216
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,360
 about five years ago, we were sitting around

1217
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,200
 in a living room and I think Michael Abbott said,

1218
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,080
 it would be really good to get Kieran Gillens

1219
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,960
 as a guest of honor at FollyCon.

1220
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,440
 And I said enthusiastically yes,

1221
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,720
 and the reason I said yes was because of new games journalism

1222
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,240
 rather than because of his comics writing

1223
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,280
 with which I was not familiar at the time,

1224
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,240
 I had been an inordinate fan of Kieran Gillens

1225
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,880
 for games journalism rather than,

1226
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,240
 because I am, as everyone who listens to this podcast

1227
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,800
 probably knows by now, a very considerable games addict

1228
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,040
 and nobody was writing sensibly about games

1229
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,600
 except for Kieran Gillens, I slightly exaggerate,

1230
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,080
 but not much and that was really important to me.

1231
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,080
 And I think that games are not well-loved by,

1232
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,760
 are they not well-supported by EasterCon

1233
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,880
 despite the fact that most EasterCon members

1234
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,120
 are actually quite into gaming

1235
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,840
 and it's a thing that we probably,

1236
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,160
 not, it's not that we should have more games at the EasterCon,

1237
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,400
 it's fine to have games at conventions,

1238
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,200
 but I think that we don't do enough,

1239
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,960
 I'm always after talking about what it is

1240
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,000
 that we're doing when we are making the thing.

1241
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,840
 So deconstructing things in greater detail

1242
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,640
 than just, oh, the plot stuff that I talked about last week.

1243
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,520
 And I think that games journalism is one of the core,

1244
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,520
 you know, talking about what it is that people are doing

1245
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,480
 when they are playing games, it's a lot interesting

1246
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,720
 than saying, and I liked this game

1247
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,560
 because it had interesting characters

1248
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,920
 or because the cards were nicely cut.

1249
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,520
 - Yeah, so I remember that slightly differently

1250
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,240
 'cause I think I said, maybe we should get Kieran Gillen

1251
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,200
 and Alison went, yes, for his game journalism

1252
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,920
 and my club went, yes, for his comics.

1253
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,400
 And then we were like, okay, well, then he definitely

1254
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,240
 like fits the bill.

1255
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,760
 So I would be delighted if we were to end up as a podcast

1256
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,440
 in the new games journalism style,

1257
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,480
 although I think we might need to be a bit weirder.

1258
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,840
 (laughing)

1259
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,240
 - Challenge accepted.

1260
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,520
 - My thinking of new games journalism

1261
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,760
 is it was digging into those things,

1262
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,000
 but it also wasn't afraid to kind of be a little bit

1263
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,720
 strange while doing them.

1264
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,280
 - Yes, I think the surrealism of Sharpe sit down

1265
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,280
 is definitely part of that.

1266
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,120
 - Yeah.

1267
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,720
 - And I know that Kieran Gillen is a friend of Quins

1268
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,560
 and Matt Lee's and has written for Sharpe sit down

1269
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,320
 on occasion himself, mostly about Warhammer.

1270
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,080
 So we have two more letters of comment.

1271
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,440
 Firstly, Malcolm Hutchison,

1272
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,200
 which he signed his letter as Chockey Monster,

1273
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,240
 which I already did not know was his pseudonym,

1274
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,280
 but I'm gonna use it.

1275
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,920
 So Chockey Monster asked whether they could have

1276
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,200
 comped Hugo finalists today membership.

1277
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,920
 I believe this did eventually effectively happen.

1278
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,920
 I believe Hugo finalists were given the ability to attend,

1279
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:50,400
 or as a Hugo finalists did not take them up on that,

1280
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,680
 'cause I was attending a Arkham Horror Convention this weekend,

1281
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,240
 but I think that was done.

1282
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,240
 And I think we will be talking a bit more about

1283
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,040
 the nuts and bolts of Consi-land next time.

1284
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,040
 The final lock is from one Claire Breiley of Croydon.

1285
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,160
 And she has written a poet.

1286
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,400
 - So the Octothorpe Poetry Corner.

1287
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,920
 - On rudeness.

1288
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,000
 The higher minds of Octothorpe have made it very clear,

1289
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,360
 clean up your dodgy poetry.

1290
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,120
 They want no rudeness here.

1291
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,280
 We've checked and so it now appears safe topics can include

1292
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,960
 seeing comments leaping even with a naked eye,

1293
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,320
 and it seems it isn't rubber, so it's also not too rude.

1294
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,320
 If your only need for latex is transliterated tie,

1295
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,440
 they nonetheless put in themselves really very sinister,

1296
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,000
 a sudden and quite unprovoked terrible prime minister.

1297
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,280
 So avoiding offence is just more mark protection,

1298
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,040
 and listeners too, all those blushes to spare.

1299
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,440
 Yet when Alison Ponder's sports body perfection,

1300
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,080
 John Waze her words and concluded, that's fair.

1301
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,720
 So sing double standards and don't try your luck,

1302
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,880
 even if you think it's just a comedy, ah, yes,

1303
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,480
 this isn't gonna get featured either, is it?

1304
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,760
 And it's the one I like most, despite the complicated meter.

1305
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,960
 But maybe this one will be more accepted.

1306
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,720
 - Going down under.

1307
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,800
 Alison wants more subscribers and rest,

1308
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,520
 and maybe a pie is a float of the best.

1309
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,880
 When did today start?

1310
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,080
 Who can say where it ends?

1311
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,200
 Adelaide site seen by phone, held by friends.

1312
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,600
 Western Australia, then nullable.

1313
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,800
 Friday night drinks over Zoom, not a pub crawl.

1314
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,960
 Discord with Erwin while watching the football.

1315
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,080
 Don't say the city name if you're not sure.

1316
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,600
 Canberra, Sydney, the beaches up north,

1317
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,040
 Hobart, Tasmania, Capitol radio,

1318
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,160
 then just the whole of New Zealand to go

1319
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,920
 and finally sleep going home on the fourth.

1320
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,280
 Guff passes the 21st century test,

1321
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,200
 the modern fan travels by Oculus Quest.

1322
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,880
 Coming up, the live broadcast.

1323
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,520
 Octa thought live what to drink, what to wear.

1324
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,320
 John needs to check all the settings in Zoom to record it,

1325
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,520
 and Liz needs to tidy the room for Alison

1326
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,800
 not to be there.

1327
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,360
 This is not a podcast for fan technophobes.

1328
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,560
 John leave out the magnetosphere,

1329
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,960
 but speed up the sound and it still seems quite clear

1330
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,360
 unless they're talking to Tobes.

1331
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,680
 Liz has no thoughts on all French aristocracy.

1332
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,000
 John is still pondering Hugo democracy,

1333
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,360
 and where is the fun at a virtual comm?

1334
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,720
 Join us with Octa thought, fan nerd or geek,

1335
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,000
 then Alison's hoping to sleep for a week.

1336
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,200
 Right then, I do need to let you get on.

1337
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,920
 (clapping)

1338
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,680
 Okay, thank you very much Claire.

1339
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,960
 We love them.

1340
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,280
 Keep sending poetry guys, we're never gonna stop.

1341
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,280
 So that was the 11th episode of the Octa thought podcast,

1342
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,560
 and for today it's goodbye from me.

1343
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,080
 It's goodbye from me, and it's goodbye from me.

1344
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,200
 The theme music for this episode was fanfare for space

1345
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,080

1348
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,600
 (upbeat music)

1349
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:01,500
 I should say I came upstairs, I said to my family,

1350
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,500
 I should explain that my daughter is moving out of our home

1351
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,140
 to go and live somewhere else for the first time

1352
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,220
 during the recording of this podcast,

1353
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,980
 due to what I think I would say

1354
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,100
 is a cock up on the catering front.

1355
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,980
 And so we had this sort of tearful farewell,

1356
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,140
 and I said I have to go up half an hour.

1357
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,780
 (laughing)

1358
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,500
 I was actually gonna be first.

1359
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,340
 (laughing)

1360
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,580
 Oh my goodness.

1361
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,780
 She didn't say, she didn't say,

1362
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,300
 could we move the podcast?

1363
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,380
 This is, I did not know that.

1364
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,020
 They're pointing.

1365
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,860
 Oh dear me.

1366
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,940
 I really didn't, when you say you didn't know it,

1367
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,980
 I didn't know it either.

1368
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,420
 I didn't know it until I was in the dead dog at Colzila,

1369
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,340
 and I was like, I should probably leave the dead dog.

1370
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,140
 And Marianne said, yes, you probably should mum,

1371
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,220
 'cause I'm gonna move out while you're on the podcast.

1372
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,500
 I was like, you what?

1373
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,740
 And so anyway.

1374
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,260
 So I came upstairs and I said,

1375
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,780
 I have to start the podcast early.

1376
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,460
 We're starting half an hour before we actually go live.

1377
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:03,020
 And Marianne said, that's so you can work out

1378
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,580
 before you start broadcasting exactly what you're gonna say

1379
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,380
 about George RR Martin, isn't it?

1380
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,620
 And I said, yes, you have got it right in one.

1381
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,540
 And the answer apparently is nothing,

1382
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,060
 but bits might slip out around the edges,

1383
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,660
 in which case we're terribly sorry.

1384
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,940
 Right, anyway, so yes, Marianne is moving out.

1385
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,020
 She isn't really moving out forever.

1386
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:23,220
 We've had her girlfriend stay with us for the last three months,

1387
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:27,180
 because they didn't really want to not be able

1388
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,540
 to have any physical contact.

1389
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,580
 So they wanted to be living in the same household.

1390
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,340
 And so they are now going to go and live in

1391
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,380
 Kirsty's parents' house for a few months.

1392
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,380
 So at some point, probably, things will go back to

1393
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,860
 a state of normal where people who are partners,

1394
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,020
 but do not live in the same house

1395
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,420
 are allowed to have physical contact,

1396
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,660
 at which point they will probably,

1397
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,060
 Marianne will come back and live with us.

1398
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,420
 Kirsty will stay living with her parents

1399
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,060
 until such time as they both have

1400
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,340
 gainful employment and can rent a flat.

1401
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,300
 Yes, I just assumed she was moving out

1402
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,060
 because sharing a house with you time shifted

1403
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,020
 had gotten to her to the point that she was like,

1404
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,860
 I'm out of here.

1405
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,940
 Is this how...

1406
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,020
 So what extent do you think this is true?

1407
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,860
 It's perfectly plausible.

1408
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,940
 Are you gonna add at all these berry burps out of the podcast?

1409
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,780
 I can't hear them.

1410
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,500
 I'm not going to edit you mentioning that.

1411
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,660
 We will edit your berry burps.

1412
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,220
 So have fun with that.

1413
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,060
 That's gonna be the title of the episode, "Berry Burps".

1414
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,780
 We're gonna remix it into the Octopiquilida,

1415
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,660
 the "Buttery Biscuit Bass" song.

1416
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,460
 "Berry Burps", "Berry Burps", "Berry Burps",

1417
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,380
 "Burps", "Burps", "Burps", "Burps", "Burps".

1418
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,300
 Excellent.

1419
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,140
 We're making music here.

1420
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,300
 If you're tuning in now,

1421
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,260
 you're listening to the Octopodcast,

1422
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,460
 a jam podcast for people who like music.

1423
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,260
 We were talking about something that wasn't this

1424
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,540
 and I don't really remember what it was.
