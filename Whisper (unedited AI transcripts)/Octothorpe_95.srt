1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 Also is this the first time we've managed to record from three different continents?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,840
 Yes!

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,560
 No, John was in America doing some...

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,720
 Did I record from the states though?

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,600
 No, did you record from Germany or something? That doesn't count.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,640
 I definitely recorded from Vienna, but Vienna is in Europe.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,640
 Yeah. Yeah, but England isn't.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,520
 Yep, no true.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,360
 To Pumtish.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,680
 Let me draw you a map.

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,440
 [laughs]

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:45,800
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 95th episode of Octa Thor, a podcast for

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,920
 science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 26th of October 2023.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,960
 I'm John Coxson.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,560
 I'm Alison Scott.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,240
 And I'm Liz Batty.

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,600
 And today I have written in my calendar that this

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,360
 brand you will be doing Halloween decorating, so she may be listening to this while she's

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,360
 doing that. And if she is, I love you. My co-hosts are utterly baffled by this

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,720
 public display of affection in the way that befits British people.

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,800
 I like this display of affection.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,760
 [laughs]

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,760
 This is the bringing of pancakes to John while he is on the podcast by a

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,640
 Spaniard.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,520
 Okay, so tomorrow, Stephen will be shipping something that I accidentally sold on eBay

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,880
 in the middle of my gup trip.

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,200
 Hi, honey. I love you.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,600
 Shall we do some letters of comment?

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,920
 So the first letter of comment and arguably the most important one was a letter of comment

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,480
 from Laurie of Hugo Girl, who said, "Thank you, next year is your year."

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,440
 And that is because Hugo Girl won the Hugo for Best Fancast,

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,160
 and we're very happy.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,880
 Yay! Hurrah!

34
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,240
 Yeah, we're very pleased for them.

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well done. Well done, Pug Coss Buddies.

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,640
 That was very good.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,800
 I would have had a champagne breakfast, but I'm tired, so I'm having a coffee breakfast,

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,840
 like normal.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,320
 I was fast asleep for the Hugo's. I was very,

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,160
 I was definitely going to stay up for the Hugo's, but it was all a bit much.

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,880
 I went to bed.

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,800
 I mean, we'll get into it.

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,120
 Yeah, so by the time I'd wilt it up, I'd lost two Hugo's.

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,160
 I've forgotten you lost two Hugo's.

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,880
 Sorry, Alison.

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,400
 It's okay.

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,040
 It might be all for the best, because as I'm sure we'll get into later,

48
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,480
 I'm not sure it would have been that easy to actually watch the Hugo's.

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,680
 I did not watch the Hugo's either, because I was at the ballet.

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,400
 But fortunately they announced our category literally like two minutes before I had to turn

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,440
 my phone off and put it away, so when you were lost.

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,200
 And it was like, okay, well, I'll watch some dancing instead.

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,920
 If I had watched the Hugo's, I wouldn't have tried to log in.

54
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,880
 I'd have just joined this Seattle Zoom and chatted to other people who were trying to

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,360
 watch the Hugo's, but in practice, I didn't do that.

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,880
 So I went to bed.

57
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,480
 We had other letters of comment.

58
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,040
 We had a layer of comment from Dave Mansfield.

59
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,840
 Dave said that Liz's mic sucked the last two weeks.

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,880
 Sorry to listeners who noticed that.

61
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,640
 Basically, Liz has a new microphone.

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,640
 This is very exciting, and there will be like a few dealing problems here and there until

63
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,680
 we get that sorted out.

64
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
 I want to discuss Dave's next point.

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,040
 He stopped his Patreon for a skateboard, and he mentioned all of the discord that about

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,040
 a quarter of their recent episodes were literally unlissenable due to audio quality.

67
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,640
 So someone would reply and he'd respond, some more reply and he'd respond,

68
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,280
 and say things like, they're trying to get more diverse voice readers,

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,680
 and he'd reply that they make a point of saying these aren't amateurs,

70
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,960
 and a skateboard pays all their contributors, and the other people on the discord said he was

71
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,400
 being a dickhead, and then he is not voting for a skateboard in the Hugo's.

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,960
 There is a difference between a semi-prosine and a professional media organization.

73
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,040
 A semi-prosine will repay its contributors a professional wage, but they are semi-pros.

74
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,240
 If the BBC ships one of its contributors a microphone and it doesn't work,

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,480
 that will be discovered half an hour after it doesn't work,

76
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,200
 and a new one will arrive half an hour after that, and that process will repeat until it is fine.

77
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,880
 A skateboard doesn't have that level of ability, and if they're trying to bring in

78
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,880
 more diverse voices, those more diverse verses will be in a position of financial privilege,

79
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,520
 which is substantially less than any of the three of us recording this.

80
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,280
 And I do think it is probably important to bear that in mind.

81
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,880
 I'm going to give a simple version of the other thing, though, which is,

82
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,160
 I don't listen to podcasts, I can't listen to, and I think that's a very common approach,

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:36,520
 so it would be better to have fewer more diverse voices and give them equipment

84
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,720
 than to have voices I can't listen to.

85
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,480
 It should bring voices on one at a time as it can afford to equip them,

86
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,520
 because I don't think there's any point recording narrators that people can't hear.

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,840
 I would say here, the BBC has plenty of unlistenable podcasts that are terribly recorded,

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,080
 especially with intrusive background noise and music that make them impossible to listen to,

89
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,920
 and it's not just small producers that have troubles producing listenable content.

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,760
 I mean, I was going to say, I think I'm somewhere in the middle, which is, I kind of

91
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,040
 sympathize with both sides. I think there is a need to work out, you know, on

92
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,800
 the part of podcasts with minimal budget, what is the kind of minimum viable setup?

93
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,560
 And I will say I've been recording the podcast for three years on what is,

94
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,280
 I think, a 20-quid headset microphone, and I don't think the sound is quite as great as it has been

95
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,360
 from you two with actual more professional microphones, but I think it was okay and listenable.

96
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,520
 So I think the need here is to say, okay, what is the minimum amount of tech we need?

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,680
 Is that tech something that can be inquired in the places where your diverse readers are?

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:56,360
 And to kind of, yeah, maybe either commit to providing that for your, not readers, for your

99
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,440
 narrators, or is it a need for something where they say, okay, we're going to have to run a

100
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,280
 fundraiser so we can get better equipment. That can be part of our Kickstarter or our goals for

101
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,320
 next year to try and get that up, because I do think there is a real risk that if you're producing,

102
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:17,000
 you know, content with more diverse voices, but then those voices in particular are the ones who

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,560
 have kind of poor production values, and there's a risk that people will stop listening specifically

104
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,360
 to those diverse voices. I completely agree with that. I think, I think, and I think the thing I

105
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,560
 would want. I think the thing I think would help Dave's point a lot is if he had started with the

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,520
 phrase, speaking as someone coming from a position of wealth privilege, I think that,

107
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,000
 because I think the real problem with the way you're framing it, Dave, is that it doesn't seem to me

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,400
 like you are taking that into account when you're complaining about this. And like, it might be

109
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,520
 that you are, but nothing in your words actually says that. And I do think it's worth making people

110
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,080
 aware that that's true when you have these arguments, because that was the first thing that

111
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,800
 leapt out to me, and I feel like I'm probably a sympathetic reader of your complaints. So someone

112
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,280
 who doesn't know you from Adam, it's an interesting thing to think about how you provide constructive

113
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,040
 criticism to projects you like, because I think there is a way of doing it that will make it hard

114
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,600
 for them to take that criticism on board. This is something I think a lot about, because I'm in

115
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,880
 science communication, and most of my job on that side of things is working out how to tell people

116
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,600
 things in ways that will be accessible to them and be something they want to hear.

117
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:33,960
 Speaking true to power is great, but it's not useful if the person you're speaking to has no

118
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,040
 obligation to listen, if that makes sense. I think we also talk a bit about the microphone

119
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,680
 end of this, whereas the things that cause people with lower wealth privilege to have trouble

120
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,920
 creating clear sound, or may extend to things like the room they're in, or the people they're

121
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:59,880
 sharing their space with, which are much harder to solve than just getting yourself a headset mic.

122
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,280
 Yeah, so I live in a, I mean, Alison and I both live in five bedroom houses, where we have rooms,

123
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,760
 where we can podcast uninterrupted for two hours and be sure that that will not be interrupted,

124
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,080
 unless we ask our spouses to bring us breakfast.

125
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,560
 And coffee. And I think if you think about all of the forms of privilege that are inherent in the

126
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,760
 sentence I have just said, and really dive into them, you'd be like, oh man, those peeps, they

127
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,720
 got a little privilege right there. Like, hmm, I drink my Colombian coffee drink, which I kind of

128
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,920
 want to buy from the market. And it's like, I think five bedrooms don't. Yep. Do you have like a

129
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,600
 secret hidden wing? I didn't go in. I don't remember all those bedrooms. You know the

130
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,640
 glorified cupboard next to the spare room, Liz? Yeah. Oh, that is officially a bedroom.

131
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,240
 Oh, that's a cupboard. Welcome to the privilege zone.

132
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,840
 I will finish this by saying what I've noticed while recording this is that I really need a pop

133
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,640
 filter for this microphone. So I apologize to the listeners. Also, I don't have a pop filter this

134
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,720
 week. So John, you must have some sort of software plosives thing, because I have got like a sock on

135
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,240
 it, but I couldn't, I couldn't for the space to bring a pop filter. And you see, you see the other

136
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:27,480
 problem, Dave, which is look at these two. I love you both very much. So Esther says that she will

137
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,560
 arrange the cage fight between Chris and Abigail. And rest assured, she is a certified doctor and

138
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,000
 professor of game studies, meaning that many years of drinking red potions and eating chickens I

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,680
 found on shelves and in other people's rock sacks means that she is well equipped to be the medical

140
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,880
 professional onsite. And then she talked about Glasgow presents. And she noted that it is,

141
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,240
 it was set up by Megbitt Donald and Marita Averati. And it's being run by Pam Livingston and Robin

142
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,040
 Duncan. They thought it was going to be a couple of pandemic panels. And it's basically spawned into

143
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,000
 this collection of nearly 40 panels on various topics. And she notes this, she thinks that's

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,520
 hyper innovation is something that they should be encouraging. And yes, no, there is a good point

145
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:15,000
 well made. We got a new listener emailed in, or maybe not a new listener, maybe a long time

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,720
 listener, but first time caller, S. J. Johnson said that they wanted to say they really enjoyed

147
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:26,440
 the podcast. And they thanked Alison's recommendation of the actual star by Monica Burns, which is their

148
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,000
 best read so far this year. They're in Melbourne. Did you meet S. J. Johnson, Alison?

149
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:42,440
 Alison has gave me a look. I don't think so. No. What year is it? What day is it? What continent is

150
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,040
 it? Ah, yeah, no, I've probably got a list somewhere. No, I don't think I met S. J. Johnson. Sorry.

151
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,920
 S. J. Johnson, I was in Melbourne for the first time in my life about two and a half weeks ago.

152
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,160
 It would be lovely to meet up. And she'll never be back. Join Nova Mob, which is a Melbourne Science

153
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,960
 Fiction Society or the Melbourne SF Society, which is another Melbourne SF Society.

154
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:10,120
 Chris Garcia emailed us about our best novel episode. Oh, hang on. And also emailed us on the

155
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,080
 other episode. Lock number one, he says that Alison pronounces the word "giff wrong". No, no,

156
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,120
 he said that before. We've said he's wrong before. We're done, right? Yeah. And we'll come back to

157
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,440
 that when we discuss Jeff. And then he also said that the, he wrote in about our best novel episode

158
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,880
 and said that the best episode, the best of the novels was The Spare Man. And I would characterize

159
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,920
 every single other Lock we got on that episode as fundamentally disagreeing with him on that point.

160
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,680
 Our comments on The Spare Man resonated with our listenership. Yeah, there are a lot of people

161
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,320
 didn't like that book. I feel a bit bad because I think when I listened back to the episode,

162
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,960
 that's the one where I really kind of, well, I think it was me and Alison. We both went off

163
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,040
 and wanted exactly the same direction. And so we were maybe a little bit harsh. Might have been a bit

164
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,840
 harsh. Yeah, I didn't think it was a great book, but I liked it a heck of a lot more than you did.

165
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,320
 And we now know who won foreshadowing and I have rants. Well, that makes it worse, really,

166
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,120
 because if it had won, then it'd be like, well, who cares if these two podcasters didn't like it?

167
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,200
 But since it didn't win, I feel a bit worse. Well, we haven't got the stats yet, so we don't know

168
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,920
 it. Could have come second. Ballsy. We got so many layers of comment. We thank you all for writing in.

169
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,400
 You're all very lovely. Is there anything else we want to particularly pick up on before we

170
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,320
 stop talking about that as a comment? Because there was so many comments and we can't read them all.

171
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,760
 I don't think we could pull out all of the letters of comment, but thank you to everyone

172
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,040
 who sent commiserations. Yes, thank you very much to everyone who did. Which is radge,

173
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,680
 but I'm sure there'll be more. I want to pull out one thing from Abigail's comment, which I agree

174
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,440
 with, which is her definition of cozy fantasy runs more towards something like Catherine

175
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,720
 Allison's The Goblin Emperor, where the main character triumph spikes, then in trust and generosity,

176
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,480
 but finding people who are decent and kind to promote and rely on puts to places meaningful

177
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,400
 challenges in his path. And I would agree with all that and I like The Goblin Emperor and yeah,

178
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:12,280
 I think that feels like a cozy, nice book to read because problems get overcome and it feels like

179
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,480
 the world is becoming a better place through this one person, but not because they don't do anything

180
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,720
 and things just kind of work out. Very realistic depiction of civil service and why you need one.

181
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,120
 I, you know, it's a good book. I really like Allison. Yeah, it is a good book. I'm glad that Liz

182
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,880
 Pook kicked it out because I also loved that book when I read it on the Hugo shortlist and I found

183
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:42,040
 it very stressful. So I disagree fundamentally that it's cozy. Yeah, it had lots of interpersonal

184
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,560
 conflict in it. There were several parts where I had to put it down and come back to it later.

185
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,120
 So yes, it's not cozy in the way that legends and lattes is cozy. You know, I've had sweaters that

186
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,400
 were less cozy than legends and lattes. It's goes in the way that makes me feel better about the

187
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:05,000
 prospects of the world in a way, but not cozy in a yeah, in a this is like a comfy blanket way.

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,240
 It is a great book though. I think we all agree with that. Highly recommend readers if you have

189
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,800
 not read the Goblin Emperor, go seek that out because it is 10 out of 10. Well, maybe not 10 out of 10,

190
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,480
 maybe five out of five. Good reach. But yeah, great book. So we're talking about the Hugo's.

191
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,840
 We might as well carry on talking about the Hugo's right. What won a Hugo?

192
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,080
 Let alone bone one the best novel Hugo, which is quite a good thing because it

193
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,080
 involved prevented me from having to, you know, scream loudly and prolongedly.

194
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,360
 Yes, that is fair. So yeah, so okay, should we do the good ones first and then the bad ones?

195
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,000
 Or should we do it the other way round? We should do it in some kind of order.

196
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,560
 How often am I allowed to say in the course of this episode, if only we had the long list at the

197
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,920
 point we were recording this episode? That is the only time you're allowed to say it. I don't

198
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,560
 disagree, but at the time of recording, we do not have the full stats. So this is wild speculation,

199
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,160
 but it's good because it means we can ring, we can ring the speculation water out of the Hugo's

200
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,000
 next episode where we do have the full stats. Or maybe the episode of that. I can't remember

201
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,640
 what our recording schedule is. We should also say thank you to Nicholas White because without

202
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:22,600
 Nicholas, we would not know anything about the Hugo so many. So thanks Nicholas. Also, we should

203
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,360
 maybe thank him for being our designated acceptor. Yes, we would like to take credit for the fact

204
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,040
 that Nicholas was in a position to be the correspondent. We needed him to be. But no, we asked Nicholas

205
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,280
 to be our acceptor and he very graciously accepted. He was also my acceptor and I got an email

206
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:47,480
 about, I don't know, well into yesterday going, you have not sent me a speech. If you want to

207
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,200
 send me a speech, please send it to me by WeChat because it's the only thing that works here.

208
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,480
 So I had to get back into my WeChat account whilst, you know, in Melbourne trying to do

209
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,200
 guff things. I'm doing Melbourne. Where am I? Whilst in Wellington trying to do guff things.

210
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,520
 And I did manage to get back into my WeChat account despite the fact that I was all

211
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,800
 a different continent from the last time I've used it and friends. That's not always easy.

212
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,840
 And I did send him a speech which obviously he didn't need to use which did not surprise me

213
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,480
 in the slightest. The astounding award went to Travis Baldry who wrote "Legends L'Arteys".

214
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,240
 I do not think, I do not think he was the best option in that category but I am not surprised

215
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,000
 at who won. That is fair. I can't remember who else was in that. I don't think I read very widely in

216
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,400
 "Astounding". Well I was, I voted for Isabel Kim in that category. Isabel Kim, yeah. It's got

217
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,280
 short, their short fiction is great but I'm not particularly surprised that the person who is also

218
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:53,720
 in best novel was maybe read by a lot of people as well. Yep, that is very fair. And like, you know,

219
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,400
 it might be that as Baldry matures as a writer he writes slightly less cozy things that is more

220
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,520
 to your taste but it also might not be. Well also I think he's already quite mature as a writer and

221
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,000
 he was writing a particular sort of fan fiction. I'm sure he can write other things. It was very

222
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,040
 competent book. But he's not. I don't mean like, I've written a lot of things but if I wrote a novel

223
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,080
 you wouldn't use my like papers as evidence that I could write. You know what I mean? Like,

224
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:28,840
 he has written a lot but not in this form I guess. I basically just be slightly optimistic about

225
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,680
 things in my sort of general, vaguely positive way. Yeah, no, I'm sure he can write better things

226
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,160
 because I don't think there's anything, there isn't anything wrong with the novel. It's just not

227
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,040
 what I'm looking for in a science fiction novel. So you know, it's not really a matter of maturing,

228
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,560
 it's a matter of kind of changing novelistic direction which you'll probably do if the money

229
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,800
 in this particular novelistic direction runs out or if the ideas run out. And then in "Load

230
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,800
 Start" it was "A Catwoman" by Nadiok Korafor which as previously discussed I think is the weakest of

231
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:08,120
 those six but I guess it resonated with people. And I think I have not read most of these six books.

232
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,720
 Listen, have you read these six? No, I've read one of them so I can't really judge. Was it the Rachel

233
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,760
 Harmon? No, it was Naomi Novik. Oh yeah, have you read the Rachel Harmon? I've read the other ones in

234
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,480
 the series but not this one. So I read it obviously in my way having not read any of the rest of the

235
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,560
 series because you know I'm an absolute legend. I loved it, I thought it was so good, it makes me

236
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,560
 want to go back and read the previous installment. I thought it was really really really good.

237
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:42,200
 It's fannya didn't. In what regular listeners may come to be learning is a recurring theme.

238
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,920
 But no, well done to Ocarofor for a Catwoman. A Catwoman is the third in a trilogy, the previous

239
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,480
 two installments of which I had not read so I don't know whether it's sort of better if you read it

240
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,200
 having read the others. Can I go off in a tiny tangent for you John? This is probably not for

241
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:05,640
 podcast but I was watching the ballet of Anna Karenina yesterday and it had like little intertitles to

242
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:12,280
 tell you what was happening in each mini act or dance. One of them was like in the Karenina household

243
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:18,840
 there is a marital discord and I don't know, I just think you and España have a marital discord.

244
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,800
 Oh not like the Karenins. No, not like the Karenins. I mean come on now. We don't have a marital

245
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:33,720
 discord. We have an iMessage chat. A joke. That was a good story. Thank you Liz. Best fan artist

246
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,240
 Richard Mann. So Richard did my wedding photography. He is a very talented man. He makes me laugh

247
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,440
 whenever I hang out with him. I was glad to see him win this especially because he has been doing

248
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:52,360
 adjacent stuff for a long time. He does a lot of very good work photographing a lot of people.

249
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:59,160
 Yes. At photographing a lot of people at conventions. I mean obviously I'm sad for Alison and for España

250
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,360
 that they did not win and for Ian that he did not win and Ryan and Leia are probably lovely people

251
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,360
 but I've got no skin in the game. Sorry, Ryan and Leia if you're listening. But Richard is,

252
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,880
 yeah. This was a category where I would have been happy. Like there's like four of the six people

253
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,440
 that would have maybe absurdly happy to see them when a hugo. So like this would kind of a win-win

254
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,600
 for me in many ways. Obviously not being one of the nominees helps. Sorry, one of the finalists.

255
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:31,960
 One of the finalists. It's an honour just being nominated. Chris M. Barkley won best fan writer.

256
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,840
 Again this is probably very eminently deserved. I think I am slightly sad that it wasn't

257
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,040
 Bitter Corilla who remains one of my absolute favourite fan writers in the genre generally.

258
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,320
 But I think Chris Barkley winning is a really good thing. Very difficult to be annoyed by that.

259
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,640
 Congratulations Chris and congratulations Richard. North River actually said that out loud.

260
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,280
 And then it was Hugo Girl. Transatlantic besties. Yay. Yeah and I wasn't surprised by this if I'm

261
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,720
 honest. I sort of expected them to take it because last year they came third or second I think and

262
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:12,440
 so I was like they got a good chance and indeed they have won. Hurrah! Hey and instantly recuse

263
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,480
 themselves for future years. Did they? That's sweet. Best fan scene, Zero Gravity. I'm probably

264
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,400
 the only one of us who's read this at all. I quite enjoyed the bits of it I read and I read it by

265
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,320
 randomly throwing chunks of it into Google Translate. So I probably didn't get the perfect

266
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,120
 thing but it was all fascinating stuff about the development of science fiction fandom in

267
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,400
 Shire and I was like oh I never do that. I never knew that. I mean it turns out there's a lot of

268
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,240
 stuff in the world I never knew. And this complete obsession I have with learning everything is not

269
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,200
 too many favours but anyway I like learning those bits. So well done Zero Gravity. It does sound

270
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,200
 fascinating. Is it? I'm thinking of it as kind of a sort of Chinese version of Rob Hansen. Is that fair?

271
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,600
 I don't think it is. I think their episodes are different right? Different episodes are...

272
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:09,000
 It's got a little bit of journey planet about it as well and I think they've got some crossover

273
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,800
 work. So some of the stuff they have published is some of the stuff that appeared in the Chinese

274
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,840
 issue of Journey Planet and there's some links there and some of the stuff they were doing was

275
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,720
 kind of reaching out to science fiction fans in different places and writing greetings from them.

276
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,240
 So you know it's just all that bringing fans together that gives me such a warm cozy feeling.

277
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,920
 Yeah I'll just say that given that I think not as many of the finalists were at the ceremony as

278
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,360
 maybe in other years because it was in China it does seem pretty nice that actually you know Chris

279
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,360
 Barclay and Richard Mann won and you know Zero Gravity newspaper won all people who would be there

280
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,240
 to collect in person which is really nice. So we proceed and you've already put in a rant about

281
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,520
 that. I mean we know one can he's great I don't need to be told every year like there's more in the

282
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,320
 genre than this. It's very frustrating. I'm going to stop I'm going to stop my Patreon to it because

283
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,000
 I'm increasingly uncomfortable with the distorting effect it's having on the genre and yeah I think

284
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,600
 I think if anyone from my county are listening the reason I am not subscribing to you anymore is

285
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,320
 because you are dominating that category and it is not a healthy four science fiction in general.

286
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,360
 It's very good. It's tricky I mean we've had this discussion about recusal before because they do

287
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:26,280
 very good. They do. Stories is a problem but I think other other places do very good stories as

288
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,200
 well and I do want some of them to start getting a bit more recognition. We had this with um

289
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,360
 Ansible all those years ago and false alternative for that matter and locus and you know and Dave

290
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:46,200
 Langford. I cannot think of a run of double digit winners where people look back and say it was

291
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,160
 very good that that thing won all those times. Every single time someone looks back on the history

292
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,880
 of the genre it is oh it was bad that that happened and so I do think I'm kind of need to think a

293
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,160
 little bit about their long-term legacy because if they are mentioned in the same breath as all

294
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,960
 these problem winners is that good for them I don't know. So you're going to be at the business

295
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:11,240
 meeting at Glasgow right John? I mean so you'll put forward a proposal for automatic recusal after

296
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,080
 three successive wins. No because Neil Clark already thinks I hate semi-prozine so I can't do that.

297
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,640
 Well it's not just for semi-prozine. True for anything. You win three successive times you get

298
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,280
 not you can't go and that goes for authors for books. If you as an author win with three successive

299
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,160
 novels you're at for a year. I don't mind it but we should have this conversation another day

300
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:37,960
 because there's a lot to talk about today. Angie Zhao I don't have opinions on professional

301
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,080
 artists this year really. I have an opinion which is that they were all great but I really really

302
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,920
 liked NJ's house stuff because it was a little bit of a different style. It reminded me of sort of

303
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,960
 Stefan Martinier's stuff that he did for you know like him at Donald's books a while back.

304
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,760
 I really love all that kind of gents. Spaceships and cityscapes and everything they just looked

305
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,520
 amazing so I'm very glad with that winner. Oh yeah no I liked I liked their stuff a lot as well

306
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:12,200
 especially the one of the redheaded women looking at the spacecraft engines was very very good.

307
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,840
 I think I'm right in saying I did not put them top bar like I am not at all annoyed that they

308
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:25,640
 won and in general as in many years I thought that the art on offer was like extremely beautiful

309
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:34,040
 and lovely so no bad options. I did it a lot about the rankings for professional art so I think

310
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,520
 I did it about that more than for maybe any other category because I just can't rank them on anything

311
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,520
 other than this looks the prettiest to me and that's it's a really hard thing to judge.

312
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,600
 So I want to be ranking artists on how well they're illustrating the thing that's supposed to be

313
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,840
 illustrating and I often don't know. This is why Alison hates Chris Foss. What? Well he never

314
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,040
 illustrated the thing he was supposed to be illustrated. He just drew cool spaceships but I have two

315
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,240
 books of his art and one of his originals on my wall so I am very much not on the context train.

316
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:12,680
 I am on the pretty art train. I think the one I voted for was Deet Jian Zhang. Their art reminded

317
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,840
 me a lot of John Harris in a way and I'm a big fan of John Harris's work as well.

318
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:26,280
 So yes but yes no good good stuff. We don't talk about editors so congratulations to Lindsay Hall

319
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:33,080
 for winning. I'm sure that she edited real good. Neil Clark won best editor short form. He is undoubtedly

320
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,200
 a very good editor so well done to him. Oh yeah I wanted to say it was particularly nice for Neil

321
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,760
 Clark to win at a Chinese WorldCom. Yes. Because Clubsworld has done so many translations

322
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,160
 from Chinese authors so I think it's particularly nice that he gets to win there and get the recognition

323
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,200
 there where there's a lot of authors who might owe their first English language translations to

324
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,720
 Clubsworld. So well done. So best dramatic presentation fundamentally abdicated is

325
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,720
 for responsibility to do anything interesting or cool but you know I expected everything everywhere

326
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,800
 to winks is very good even though I think it has won a lot of things already so I wish

327
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:16,360
 severance of one but what on earth the expanse was doing being Andor. I have no clue. Come on Hugo

328
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,280
 listenership. Having been around for longer. Go on Andor give us seven series. Star Wars have been

329
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,080
 around for longer. This is the first of several times I'll probably say it's going to be really

330
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,760
 interesting if we can work out how much influence the Chinese vote had because definitely it did

331
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,640
 in other categories. It'd be really interesting to me to know where the expanse is super popular

332
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,920
 there you know because it's this big space opera type show and it seems like that is a

333
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,840
 quite a big thing in Chinese fandom or if it's just everyone really loves six months.

334
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,200
 Because you would be like didn't you vote for everything everywhere all at once. No in fact I

335
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,120
 didn't. I decided that you were quite right and severance deserved my vote. Oh I had an impact.

336
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,800
 If I was writing an impact case study I'd be like I impacted Alison. Do you want to talk about this

337
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,520
 in more detail or do you want to just put in what we already said? No no I think you were you

338
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,360
 argued in the podcast that actually everything everywhere all at once has won every award

339
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,720
 available all over the world all at once and they didn't necessarily need a Hugo. Whereas it might

340
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,360
 make a real difference to severance it's just probably scrabbling for support in the way that

341
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,880
 streaming shows often do. So I would say I think if we think the Hugo's really have everly any

342
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,280
 influence over the renewal of streaming she owes I think we had too tiny a thing to really affect

343
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:42,440
 that but also it is tricky when the best science fiction. Look they've just built a building for

344
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,480
 the huge they've just built a building for the world called you know how much more impact could

345
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:54,520
 they have. Yeah do we think Apple TV care or notice? I don't know I mean Hades which had sold

346
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,960
 far more things than you know books ever sell was incredibly delighted by their Hugo.

347
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,760
 I mean they can be delighted I just don't think it will you know particularly help a show that's

348
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,320
 on the edge of renewal I just don't think it will tip the needle in much one way or another.

349
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,920
 Like I don't think they're making a sequel to Hades because it won a Hugo I think they're making

350
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,640
 a sequel to Hades because they sold a billion copies. A million to be fair but yes. I would

351
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,080
 say it's also tricky when like a really great film which is recognised at the best of the year

352
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,520
 also happens to be a science fiction film because you want to reward it for being a great science

353
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,680
 fiction film but yeah it's also it's got a lot of other award it's not often that the Oscars are

354
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,240
 like giving loads of awards the things that are in the running for the Hugos unless it's like with

355
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,640
 the rings. I shouldn't make it sound like I'm very grumpy that everything everywhere all the ones

356
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,480
 won because it is obviously a very worthy winner I mean like you know there have been previous

357
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,440
 best dramatic presentation long form winners such as Wonder Woman which were much more inexplicable

358
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:56,680
 but but yeah no there's just a small. In fact it may be one of the best films ever to win

359
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,680
 best dramatic presentation long form that's a take. That is actually that is actually potentially

360
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:10,200
 true also it had roughly infinitely more Asians in it than Severance did which I guess I think

361
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:18,280
 Severance had none and I wonder if you're you're having the awards with lots of Asian voters you

362
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,000
 might find that films that represent at least you know small segments of the Asian experience

363
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,920
 might do better. I don't think any of us are surprised by the best related work winner.

364
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:34,840
 No but it's another British winner so that's quite nice it's quite pleased yeah no I mean I should say

365
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,640
 oh the way I said that was ambiguous I think I think a deserved win yes Cyberpunk 2077 won in

366
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,560
 Best Graphics Story or Comic. I'm sure I saw someone say that it appeared on a couple of Chinese lists

367
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,640
 of like things to nominate so I assume it's popular in China so maybe that was an effect

368
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,280
 but I don't know I have not read it I have not played the video game either I have a vague resentment

369
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,400
 towards a video game because I blame it for getting Android netrunner cancelled. See episode

370
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:10,760
 wherever it was where John Monologues on Android netrunner as his pick. Yes anyone else read it?

371
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,480
 No I didn't get to it but again I think this is something you can point to potentially the

372
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,400
 influence of the Chinese vote being stronger than the maybe split non Chinese vote although no it's

373
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,320
 transferable vote you don't really get both splits but you say I mean I was very pleased to see

374
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:33,080
 that Children of Time won Best Series yeah pick surprise. The best series winning the best Hugo.

375
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,320
 Oh you know there were other good series on the list but yeah well there I mean right and that's

376
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:43,080
 the thing it was and I think actually so congratulations to Adrian I have no idea if you just need

377
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,240
 Adrian but if you do a very hearty congratulations yeah we want you to win lots more Hugo's yes please

378
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,840
 we want you to keep winning Hugo's to the point where we're going god it's Adrian Tchaikovsky again

379
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:59,560
 when is he going to recuse himself? I would like to say officially here that my opinions on

380
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,760
 recusation do not extend to Adrian Tchaikovsky and if Adrian won all five of the fiction Hugo's

381
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:11,800
 every year forever more I would be down. I would also say this means that Children of Time can

382
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,720
 have the Clark Award winner logo and the Hugo Award winner logo on its front cover and there are not

383
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,960
 that many novels that meet that brief. Not off I mean are there any I wasn't going to make any

384
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,320
 categorical statements because I don't know but I also want to say like the competition he is up

385
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,360
 against in this category like it is fierce competition so it is a very good win. Sorry I just obviously

386
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,720
 had to go and look if there's anything that could be both a Hugo winner and a Clark Award winner

387
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:49,960
 and there is an Silly Justice because it won everything and in the Clark yeah it won the Hugo

388
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:57,720
 the Nebula the Beers of Faey the Clark and the Locust Award. Good Lord and also the city in the

389
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:05,480
 city. Okay so two thirds of those are Stone Cold classics that had to be fair and Silly Justice

390
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,600
 and Silly Justice I really enjoyed at the time and I think it was the first it probably heralded a

391
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,840
 wave of books that started talking about the gender binary in a way that I think we now think is

392
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,160
 very passe but at the time really wasn't so I think that's probably slightly unfair of me.

393
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:25,000
 Oh yes but yeah I did really enjoy that book when it came out. It was very it was very shocking it

394
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,240
 shocked a lot of people. I think it gets huge credit for kind of almost spawning a sort of 21st

395
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,320
 century different style of space opera which I think is really kind of hit a resurgence

396
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,600
 you know we've got that we've got Yoon Ha Lee we've got RKD Martin. That is a very good point I don't

397
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,320
 know because I remember some people at the time being very um I think there are some people in the

398
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,960
 genre who think and Lecky is not perhaps like the pinnacle of the genre and are a bit bewildered

399
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,720
 that she won a Hugo but I do think the impact it has had on the genre in the decade after it won

400
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,240
 like it is very difficult not to say it has been hugely influential so it is probably a worthy winner

401
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,840
 in retrospect for sure. But there were people you know respected critics people I know for a

402
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,040
 long time who are like this book is literally unreadable because it has an unjend of character

403
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,000
 and I was like you know you've been reading books in which the main character is called

404
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,920
 Bleable Furb and uses words like "crogled" for the last 70 years and so why is this trip to up it's

405
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,680
 not complicated and that was so that was really really interesting that people were just completely

406
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,640
 failing to be able to read it at all despite the fact that it's much less hard to read than a lot

407
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:43,480
 of SF it's quite a simple novel. Yeah imagine how much trouble that I had if it was complicated

408
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,200
 and then Rowett tests which won Best Draw Story which I think we've talked about this before

409
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,840
 I we all think it's a great story I thought the ending slightly whimpered rather than broad but

410
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:59,960
 like still think it's a very deserving winner from Uncanny. The Space Time Painter by Hight Yarr

411
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:07,160
 do we know what Hight Yarr's pronouns are? If they're pronouns as she/her this continues an unbroken

412
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:15,640
 streak of all women winning the top four categories for I think since 2016 but if it is not it marks

413
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,560
 the end of the streak so I would quite like to know what Hight Yarr's pronouns are but if it's

414
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:27,320
 they/them this opens this opens a debate this is googling I could have googled but I've got Liz so

415
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,680
 you can hear me typing with this new thing can you? No I just you have a look you get on your face

416
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:40,200
 when you're googling Liz you get google face it's my it's my knowledge all knowledge is contained

417
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,120
 in the internet and therefore I must be able to find this out face there is one news article

418
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,920
 referring to Hight Yarr as he so we may have broken this streak I can't

419
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,600
 remember when the streak began but it was it was shortly after the puppies so it's been a quite

420
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,800
 long time Sean and Maguire won Best Novella for Where the Drowned Girls Go which was not my

421
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:06,280
 favorite of these novellas but I did I did enjoy it I enjoyed all of them I think the Nivo was my

422
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,440
 least favorite but I still like thought it was good I didn't get to all the novellas this year

423
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:19,560
 sorry I thought they were in general much better than the novels like I think I enjoyed the Nivo

424
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,920
 more than three of the novel finalists Novella can go either way sometimes it's amazing and

425
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,000
 sometimes it's like not and this year I thought it was quite a strong category where the Drowned

426
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,840
 Girl Go is kind of really sinister and creepy in a way that I really enjoyed so like it kind of I

427
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,640
 I'm not unhappy to see it win and then Natlyn Bone by T. Kingfisher the objectively correct choice

428
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,720
 won Best Novel No we all three thought it was the best novel of the six so there we go so

429
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,600
 obviously that's everybody right yep okay here goes disgust

430
00:36:52,600 --> 00:37:03,960
 how is Juff going Alison oh it's amazing so yeah no I strongly recommend

431
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:11,400
 going and having life-changingly amazing travel experiences every day for five weeks until your

432
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,280
 brain leaks out of your ears and you forget what country you're in what day it is and the fact

433
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,360
 that you left your precious kobo in the seat pocket of an airline but you have no idea which one

434
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,280
 oh no yeah so if you're in the southern hemisphere consider running for north bangerf

435
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,040
 because we'll be doing one almost immediately I really just mean Australia and New Zealand

436
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,120
 they're probably if you're anywhere in kind of the Pacific you'll be good for this

437
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,920
 June who's one of the people who's hosting me here in Wellington cannot tell the difference

438
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,200
 between my voice and Liz's voice on the podcast which is I think at first apparently we sound

439
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,040
 quite alike well you both do have northern accents oh I mean I have northern hemisphere accent

440
00:37:52,040 --> 00:38:01,800
 here's how to so if I say the word bath how do you say the word bath Liz bath there we get

441
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,880
 that's how you tell yeah because there's no r in it what there's no r in it bath it's not bath

442
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:14,120
 it's bath bath yeah so are in bath no exactly so why are you pronouncing it like there is one come on

443
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:21,560
 okay right well all I think it's done here is started an accident conversation with two

444
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,840
 firstly confirmed contrarians which is mistake one

445
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:33,880
 anyway that's the number one identifier of the difference between the northern and southern

446
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,200
 English accent so for people who are not familiar with that is that we that that people from the south

447
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:47,320
 is say the a sound as an AR in many words not all because they're pirates are what's a pirates

448
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,560
 favorite letter are yeah you'd think that but their true love is the sea

449
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,480
 it's an oldie but it's a goodie sorry you talk about guff um so yes no it's been a lot of fun

450
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:12,280
 I have met fans in many different cities I've got lots of stories they mostly make some sense

451
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:19,480
 I've done I've done amazing things I went to womb or a job yes now I'm very excited about this and

452
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,600
 you wanted to keep it quiet because you weren't sure if it's going to come off but it came off

453
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,440
 I was yeah that was the that was the thing that I say it was going to be the peak of my holiday

454
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,520
 but in fact the holiday I just had so many peak things like today I was at a concrete model of

455
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:42,200
 Stonehenge in the New Zealand countryside love it but anyway I went I went to womb which is the

456
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:49,640
 place that the British British rocket program launched its rockets from quite a long time ago

457
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,640
 it's still a protected air force base but they have unprotected a little bit of it the rocket park

458
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,320
 and the and the base canteen and when you go and get your sandwiches you go in and you think

459
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:07,560
 you're just it just says it's a cafe but it's in fact the base canteen and some Australian air force

460
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,360
 people walked in while we were there and they were wearing Australian air force camouflage and I'll

461
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:20,200
 tell you F-Loss camouflage which is kind of blue sky blues is not much use in the Australian desert

462
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:27,880
 which is not blue if they stuck out like a sore thumb but that you wouldn't be able to see them

463
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,400
 in the sky you might not be able to see them in the sky I did discover that the I've discovered

464
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,600
 all sorts of things but the the Australian air force logo is exactly the same as the RAF logo

465
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:49,800
 except with a kangaroo in the middle it just that is bloody stupid and I love it and I said that

466
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,920
 and Mink turned and said oh but didn't you know the New Zealand air force logo is exactly the same

467
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,160
 as the RAF logo except with a kiwi in the middle which is at least a bird if not a flying bird

468
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:07,640
 and it turns out that kangaroos could attain greater height than kiwis because basically the

469
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:16,200
 only way to get a kiwi to fly is to kick it um I do not in any way condone the kicking of kiwis

470
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,320
 who are with a kind of adorable and football shaped I have not seen a kiwi I have seen a kangaroo

471
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,920
 seen several kangaroos but I saw one kangaroo hopped in front of the car as we were driving along the

472
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,000
 road and luckily we were driving quite slowly at the time and the kangaroo was just far enough

473
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,440
 away that it was quite exciting and not too scary for Damien who really did not want to have a close

474
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,520
 encounter with kangaroo and it was an enormous kangaroo as well so that was quite nice

475
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,960
 see some emus with emu chicks by the side of the road as well that's quite good yeah Australia's big

476
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,520
 I've been on a lot of aeroplanes aeroplanes are still boring did you know that every airport in

477
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:56,520
 Australia as far as I can tell has a brewery tap room in it so I've drank a lot of craft beer at

478
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,200
 breakfast time on the on the excuse that I had to drink as much different beer as possible I've got

479
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:08,120
 an aeroplane where I have to basically finish off as much postcards as a getting sent this trip

480
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,880
 and also I hope you sleep and then I've got the aeroplane back to the UK where I'm expecting to

481
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,400
 sleep as much as I possibly can and now I'm in New Zealand and I've just got a couple more

482
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,840
 stops and then I'll be back in the UK which has been great have you seen any animals other than the

483
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:30,760
 kangaroo that could kill you because I assume Australia is full of em I have been told by many

484
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,040
 people about all of the things that will kill you Kerry Lanahan asked me what's the most dangerous

485
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:42,440
 animal in Australia and I said I'm pretty sure that's man and he gave me that kind of look and he

486
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,600
 told me about various things that would kill me but then when I went swimming I was swimming in a

487
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:53,320
 kind of lovely rock pool in Sydney that's historic and it had a no photography rule which prevented

488
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,760
 me from taking the the photograph of the thing of the posts that said beware of the following things

489
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,520
 in this pool that might kill you do not let them kill you so that's what that's what Australia is

490
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,880
 like Australia is full of things that will kill you and New Zealand doesn't have any things that

491
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,920
 will kill you yeah apart from me don't cars and so on that's that's that's that's how you tell

492
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,400
 the difference between and also Australia Australia has some quite tall mountains but they're all

493
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,920
 just kind of lumpy they just look like lumps whereas New Zealand has lots and lots of pointy

494
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,400
 mountains so even their little mountains are very pointy it's a pointy country rather the kind of

495
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,000
 flat lumpy country people probably knew this but I didn't I kind of from the vantage point of

496
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,560
 Wolfenstein Australia and New Zealand look much the same to me but now I'm here there obviously

497
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,400
 very different I knew that I've read last chance to see so the only things I know about New Zealand

498
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,320
 and Australia basically come from Douglas Adams explaining them because Douglas Adams is very

499
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:52,360
 good at explaining things if you took the whole of Norway scrunched it up a bit shook out all the

500
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,480
 moose and reindeer held it 10,000 miles around the world and filled it with birds then you'd be

501
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,640
 wasting your time because it looks very much as if someone has already done it that was Douglas

502
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,400
 Adams description of the south part of New Zealand so the first episode of last chance to see is

503
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,160
 about the Kakapo and since then they've been doing a Kakapo recovery program and I believe

504
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,440
 there are Kakapo at Zelandia where I'm going tomorrow I don't know whether I'll actually see

505
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,680
 some wildlife refuge rather than like a zoo Zelandia's the most amazing thing they basically took a

506
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,960
 square mile of the middle of Wellington not quite the middle but square mile of urban Wellington

507
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:37,960
 and built a chain mail fence all the way around it with little with like cut links and killed

508
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:45,160
 all the mammals in so or you know displaced them but basically got rid of everything in the space

509
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,960
 that wasn't a New Zealand native and they've managed to keep it more or less mammal free

510
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,120
 except that the house mouse managed to get in through these they didn't make the gaps quite

511
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:59,880
 small enough and so they control the house mice but other than that there are no mammals in Zelandia

512
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,160
 and they are trying to essentially make it a safe space for birds and it's had the effect that

513
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,840
 there are birds that were rare in Wellington that are now nesting all over Wellington because they

514
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:17,560
 basically recovered in Zelandia and are now nesting elsewhere in the city so it's very exciting so

515
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:23,240
 that was all good and hopefully I'll see a Kakapo and much well they're not much recovered but

516
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,920
 they are they are not so endangered as they were at the point where um covered in and Adams were

517
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,440
 writing lost chance to see oh yeah you know it is I was just gonna say that the Adams when Adams

518
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,560
 covered in went the people who were like working in the conservation effort for the Kakapo were

519
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,520
 very against the visiting but it turns out that they're visiting a lot for the animal and for

520
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:49,880
 the conservation effort so it was retrospectively a very good thing I think and they did in the book

521
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:55,080
 they kind of describe how they turned they did kind of wink all their way into the affections of

522
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:02,600
 the people but anyone who hasn't read last chance to see is a phenomenal book I downloaded the

523
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,400
 radio show because it's a radio show right that then became a book um I don't know if we know of

524
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:14,360
 any others like that and and I put on the first episode you know like a bedtime I kind of pushed on

525
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:20,360
 and it's been more effective than I think anything else ever putting me to sleep so I've listened to

526
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,560
 the first 10 minutes of the first episode with radio show about 45 times I have no idea what

527
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,440
 happens in the rest of the series because you just just told there's like sounds of the jungle it

528
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:37,160
 was commissioned as a book and radio series simultaneously I believe oh right yeah that's probably right

529
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,320
 fair fair because they were like if you want Dr. Sam's to do a thing he's good at both I was just

530
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:50,920
 gonna tell you some a cool cacopo fact which is there are so few cacopos that they actually genome

531
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,560
 sequenced all of them and basically built a big family tree of every single cacopo that it was

532
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:01,240
 alive in 2018 it's really cool that's awesome I'll put a giant cacopo family tree in the show notes

533
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,680
 Zelandia sounds cool please take lots of photos I mean they're just professors of

534
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:13,720
 green spaces with pixels in them that are birds one thing I will say when I did my TAF trip report

535
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:19,560
 was that the one thing I never thought at any point was I regret taking that photo and in several

536
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:25,960
 times I thought I regret not taking more photos so I would just photograph indiscriminately it'll be

537
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,440
 like my photo of a snake we can't actually see the snake but I'm like there was a snake there okay

538
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,040
 they maybe don't have cacopo I know cacopo were I think cacopo have been reintroduced to the

539
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,360
 mainland though so I would have thought if it were anywhere it would be there but maybe not

540
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,600
 see like they only have them in they have they probably have them in sanctuary because they're still

541
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,520
 they're still enough that they know every bird right so I think they probably have the

542
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,880
 accessories that are long way away from people hmm when if you look at the link I put in the

543
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:01,080
 show notes it's got a map ha it does have a map I saw a load of birds coming up on the train and

544
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:07,480
 I was when I got to when I got to well into that I said to smitty so okay so I saw these birds coming

545
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,600
 up on the train they kind of look like that I was like a bit like moorhens but on stilts so she

546
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:17,160
 was like oh yes no I know except they're papa case I think they are they're um they're like a bit

547
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,840
 like moorhens but they're very they're very common birds but they're basically swamp so it's

548
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,640
 useful if you're a bird that lives in a swamp to have to have long legs so far having fun

549
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,000
 yeah no it's been amazing it's unbelievable thank you to everyone who voted for me and who

550
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,600
 supports the fanfums and hopefully I will write trip reportage that will will amuse you

551
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:46,040
 oh well I went to I went because I'm a nerd I went to a lord of the rings location today just

552
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:52,280
 just one as a kind of token lord of the rings location and john I posed against the lord of the

553
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:59,280
 the rings heich-chart marker, so I can confirm that I have taller than a dwarf, but I muched

554
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,640
 taller than a hobbit.

555
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,040
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

556
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,540
 Ah, friggin' love it - brilliant.

557
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,240
 But not as tall as Gandalf.

558
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,900
 No, no that's fair.

559
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,020
 Oh but Gandalf's not as tall as he's got a big pointy hat!

560
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,900
 It's true, we should buy you a big pointy hat, erm.

561
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,440
 I'm gonna ask you one question, and then I suggest we move on from Guff, and my question

562
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,280
 is, have you ever done anything like this before?

563
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,800
 Have I ever done anything like your Guff Trip before?

564
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,240
 How novel would you rate this experience?

565
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,160
 Oh no, it's like, as experiences go.

566
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,760
 No it's insane, it's like nothing else I have ever done in my entire life, because it's

567
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,960
 the way that you do a thing, and then the next day you do another totally different thing

568
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,760
 that is also kind of like, I'm like, well I spent a day in Crash Church, and I learned

569
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,440
 all about how it's recovering from the earthquakes, I saw these amazing views from its gondola,

570
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,920
 and every day is like this, even the days that don't have anything much in them, like

571
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,400
 I guess, I guess Bruce ships might be like this, except if I think that the experiences

572
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,080
 that people get are very sanitised, whereas a lot of the experiences that I've had on

573
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,440
 this trip have been kind of very non, they've been like totally different, because they've

574
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,240
 been like a particular fan, and said, oh we should do this, and then we've gone off and

575
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,600
 done that.

576
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,800
 And that's the thing that's so amazing about it, and I have spent a lot of time with a lot

577
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,920
 of different fans, and I've just managed to cancel my hotel room for Auckland, because

578
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,800
 I'm staying on Jo Van Ecker and's couch, so you know.

579
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,200
 Say hello to Jo for me.

580
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,240
 So it's an extra person that's an extra host, but also an extra guppy.

581
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,440
 I was worried that some of the bits of this trip weren't quite guffish enough, because

582
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,600
 I didn't have a host, but I've got one there for Auckland.

583
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,960
 The other thing I was going to say though is the average person in the UK generates carbon

584
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,320
 emissions of about 5.2 tonnes in a year, and the carbon emission calculation for this trip

585
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,320
 is about 5.9 tonnes.

586
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,720
 So I do have to make it worth it in lots of different ways.

587
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,880
 There's a lot of giving back to fandom in terms of generating content about fans and

588
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,080
 science fiction in different places, but also making this trip worth it in terms of things

589
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,560
 like trip reportage and sending everyone their housecars and stuff like that.

590
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,680
 That's a lot of carbon emissions.

591
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,280
 That sort of travel, as well as being a sign of enormous privilege in general, is not actually

592
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,080
 sustainable for everybody all the time.

593
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,560
 So it's quite important that when you do it, you actually get the word out about it,

594
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,440
 so you try and give some sense of what it's like, I think.

595
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,440
 I mean I know that there are people out there who are generating that amount of carbon emissions

596
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,880
 every week, so you know, but they're wrong.

597
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,640
 I am flying economy.

598
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,800
 I'm very fortunate because although a lot of people I talk to can't fly economy because

599
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,280
 of various health conditions, but although I have some health conditions, I'm also very

600
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,320
 short, which is a real bonus if you're trying to fly economy, let me tell you.

601
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,440
 Yeah, no that is fair.

602
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:11,880
 Alright, first pick.

603
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,760
 Cox and straight in.

604
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,080
 So I'm going to pick a game.

605
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,560
 The game is called Don't Play This Game.

606
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:23,240
 It is currently kickstarting, but they have a demo that you can play and they describe

607
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,240
 it.

608
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,040
 Oh god, how do they describe it?

609
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,880
 They describe it as something like a cross between the ring and Pokémon Go.

610
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,080
 So it's a journaling game and it encourages you.

611
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,840
 So you're basically playing a character and something is following you and the idea is

612
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,480
 that by playing the game you are opening yourself up to this thing which will then get in your

613
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,480
 head like the ring.

614
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,200
 It is a solo journaling game.

615
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,160
 It uses dice and a journal, but it also encourages you to like in the third event I played,

616
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,720
 it was like go out into your local community and take a picture of the place you wake up

617
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,600
 from this dream and then describe it.

618
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:01,320
 And so it is encouraging you to go and explore your surroundings for like specific things.

619
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,400
 So like one of the prompts was like go somewhere abandoned, take photos, explain how you break

620
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,400
 in.

621
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,000
 So it's like a scavenger hunt.

622
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,800
 Kind of, yeah.

623
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,000
 It's really, it's really, it seems really cool.

624
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,920
 I've been really enjoying playing it.

625
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:21,600
 The reason I wanted to bring it up is that I thought it was kick, I thought it might be

626
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,280
 good to point people at it because it is currently kickstarting and by the time you listen to

627
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,400
 this it will have about a week left.

628
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,120
 It is a British project and you can pledge for 15 quid to get the PDF.

629
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,120
 And there is a demo.

630
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,840
 So you can play the demo and if you hate it, go back.

631
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,920
 But if you find it very intriguing like I have, then back.

632
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
 So Liz.

633
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,920
 All right.

634
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,680
 I am going to pick a book and the book is called Love Theoretically by Ali Hazelwood.

635
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,280
 And I pick this one to be honest most because I think John is going to get a kick out of

636
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,280
 this.

637
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,760
 It is a romance novel I read on a plane because I like reading no ads or I'm planes because

638
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,800
 they don't generally take, you know, have super complicated timelines and plots and

639
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
 so on.

640
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,120
 But this is a romance novel.

641
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:13,280
 Girl meets boy when the girl is basically fake dating for money, the aromantic asexual

642
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,240
 brother of the boy.

643
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:23,120
 And then she discovers that the boy is on her tenure interview committee at MIT.

644
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:29,840
 So that is not a scenario I had come across before.

645
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,360
 Basically, yeah, she goes to meet the hiring committee and turns out it's the annoying

646
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,400
 brother who was almost seeing through her kind of fake dating of the brother, which

647
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,400
 she's doing, you know, so he can get his family off his back.

648
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,720
 And yeah, it's all about being a sort of, it's all about theoretical physics versus like

649
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:53,920
 experimental physics and it has like a terrible mentor and the roles of women and STEM all

650
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,680
 around quite satisfying romance plot.

651
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,680
 So it's quite fun.

652
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,000
 Yeah, no, that sounds awesome.

653
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 It sounds really stressful and sugaring.

654
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,080
 I mean, yeah, okay, no, I could see that read.

655
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,320
 I should say it's very American.

656
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:11,320
 So it is all about getting that like tenure track position in America, which from my external

657
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,160
 view seems like a massively stressful thing that everyone goes through in America that

658
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,480
 doesn't have quite the equivalent in the UK doing that round of all the tenure track

659
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,480
 stuff.

660
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,280
 Over here, it's basically like, can you get a fellowship that they will promise you a

661
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,280
 permanent job off?

662
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,840
 It just works differently, right?

663
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,640
 No, that sounds really cool.

664
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,960
 I might have to look that up.

665
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,960
 I still haven't read the book, the perfume book about the serial killer.

666
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,960
 What's that one?

667
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,960
 Oh, bass notes, yeah.

668
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,320
 Yeah, I still haven't read that.

669
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,280
 And that's still, that's like another one that you did that sounded delightful that I

670
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,120
 haven't got to yet.

671
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,120
 So I really do need to read more of the things Liz tells me to read.

672
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:52,080
 Alison, you've had lots of time to do pics on your guff trip.

673
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,080
 What's your pick today?

674
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,880
 I've had lots of time to do reading and watch movies.

675
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,080
 I have in fact watched some movies and I'm not going to pick any of them.

676
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:04,200
 I have an anti-pick which is watching movies on planes, which is not good for you or the

677
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,200
 movie.

678
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,120
 I'm still going to do more of it on the plane back, but there we go.

679
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,120
 Yup.

680
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,360
 I'm going to pick Australia, Australia's a country.

681
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:19,200
 It's full of nice people and fun stuff that you can do and it's got some extremely cute

682
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,600
 wildlife and I understand quite a lot of wildlife that will try to kill you though.

683
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,960
 I didn't personally notice any wildlife trying to kill me and I was there for about three

684
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,200
 weeks and I'll go back because I liked it so much for another four days in a few days

685
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,480
 time and yeah, Australia, it's great.

686
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,480
 You should go.

687
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,480
 Nice.

688
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,520
 It's obviously very homogenous.

689
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,880
 It's all exactly the same everywhere.

690
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,080
 It's not everything in Australia is different.

691
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,080
 Right?

692
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,600
 So Australia, that's my pick.

693
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:50,000
 And that was the Orchardaw podcast and it's goodbye from me.

694
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,400
 It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.
