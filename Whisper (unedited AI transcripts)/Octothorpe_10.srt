1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 So Alison, if you could look confused, I'll just take a sneaky screenshot of the zoom.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
 How does it have to look confused?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,200
 A bit like that.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:27,280
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 10th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom. I'm John Coxon.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,360
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Betty.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:41,920
 And we have several letters of comment this week and we have Max, who has written in to tell us that she beats Crazy Dave. She listens at 3x speed.

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,080
 And she says that she wishes we could speed up pub chats too.

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:57,280
 And this gave me the idea for a panel show, which is to have people listen to podcasts at various speeds, see how much they understand, and then have them drink alcohol and then repeat the process.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,600
 And so they're too drunk to understand any words and I think this could be funny to do at a convention.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,400
 Okay, so I have a theory that we should speed up tobes and see if anyone can understand him at any speed.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,480
 Yes! Yes! 100% yes.

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,880
 Because I once had a conversation with tobes where I was drunk and he wasn't and I understood everything he said perfectly.

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,240
 And I felt that I'd been, and he talked a lot of sense, and I felt that I might have been missing something for all the previous years of my life.

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
 EspaÃ±a will tell you that she doesn't understand tobes even when he's sober.

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
 But she lies, she does understand really.

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,160
 Also, happy birthday tobes, because it was tobes' birthday the day before yesterday as we record, which is the 19th of July 2020.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,800
 We should say here that we mean, when we say tobes, we mean "tobes valwa, scion of the valwalkings".

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,200
 Right, fucking of France. Liz, any thoughts on French aristocracy?

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,840
 I have no thoughts on French aristocracy.

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:05,440
 Okay, it's always worth checking. On the subject of Crazy Dave, he sent us an email and he basically says that he doesn't tend to vote in the PSFA awards,

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:19,360
 and he wishes that the number of Hugo finalists would go back down to five now that the puppies have gone silent because he finds he sometimes doesn't get round to reading all of the books and he doesn't like voting if he hasn't read everything.

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:33,840
 But he thanks us for reminding him that you can actually just not finish the things you're not enjoying because that probably has ramifications or implications for whether or not you'll think it's the best of the punch.

23
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:48,640
 But he does know he has mostly managed to finish all of the Hugo finalists in recent years because of his commute, but notes that the lockdown has somewhat hurt that method of keeping in touch with the finalists.

24
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,080
 At the time we go out, you'll have about minus one days to vote in the Hugos.

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
 There is a slender chance this will go out on the day of the deadline, but it might well be the day after.

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,960
 So if you haven't voted, it's probably too late, but you know, you could get reading.

27
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,000
 Sorry.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
 So, Mark Plummer has sent us a poem which I will now read to you dramatically.

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,680
 Shouldn't we each read our own?

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
 Oh yeah, we could each read our own stanza.

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:21,360
 Yes, please. We do have to note before we do this that Mark has written this in an order which is different to the order in which we say hello.

32
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,640
 Please do not be alarmed. This is artistic choice and it is valid and important.

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,560
 Are you going to explain why he sent us this?

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:41,520
 So, last episode we asked all of our listeners to send us poetry and Clara Hughes about members of the podcast,

35
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,960
 and me and Alison and Liz, and Mark sent us two poems in response to this challenge.

36
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:54,400
 One was a Clara Hugh about me, which is not going to be broadcast, but we all thoroughly enjoyed.

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,880
 And Liz came up with a reaction, Clara Hugh, to that.

38
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,160
 Liz, do you want me to read your poem or would you like to read your poem?

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,800
 I'm happy for you to read my poem because I have lost the email with it in,

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,920
 but I think it may be a limerick rather than a Clara Hugh because I don't know what a Clara Hugh is.

41
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,960
 And here we go.

42
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,040
 This is Untitled Limerick by Elizabeth Batty, age 34 and a quarter.

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
 Is that how old you are?

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,800
 No.

45
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,360
 Close?

46
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
 Recently close.

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,640
 On the flattering side, so we're okay.

48
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,440
 Yay!

49
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,920
 The poems of Croydon found Plummer and to tame Octothorpe for the summer,

50
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,800
 though his rhymes are first class, they're too rude to broadcast, which is really a bit of a bummer.

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,520
 Thank you, Liz.

52
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,400
 And now, have we all got the email from Markup?

53
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,280
 Excellent.

54
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,800
 So, Dr John the Boy Coxon didn't notice several locks on Octothorpe because he hadn't checked,

55
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
 and thus he failed to Mark protect.

56
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,000
 Liz Batty, also doctor, didn't know so many people had locked her.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
 Octothorpe's a fanist gestalt, but in this respect, it's all John's fault.

58
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,480
 Guff winner Alison Scott has several novers and she has also got two hugos for the fanzine

59
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,600
 plotter, but unlike John and Liz, she's...

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,640
 From you, lon.

61
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,760
 Shh, not a doctor.

62
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,760
 This ends Octothorpe poetry corner.

63
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,960
 No, but you know, we're happy to do it again.

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,760
 Please send us more poems. Yes, absolutely.

65
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,680
 Oh yes, please send us more poetry.

66
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,440
 Please keep sending us poems.

67
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,640
 Ideally, you go for faintly rude, but not as rude as Mark's previous one.

68
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,360
 I have to say, if I was responsible for editing this podcast, we'd have broadcast it, but that's just me.

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:51,120
 Alison, you are currently on New Zealand time.

70
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
 That's not so. Or Australia time.

71
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,920
 I am currently on Sydney time, which is nine hours ahead of the UK.

72
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:05,040
 It is therefore currently 9.36pm as we record, which is significantly later than we usually record.

73
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,080
 So I wasn't quite sure.

74
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,480
 I sort of said I will do a virtual guff trip and I would have loads and loads of brilliant ideas

75
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
 and I would make them all happen.

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,920
 And then I promptly forgot about it until my diary was like, "Oh, you have a first John and Liz alike.

77
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,520
 This is what Alison is like."

78
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,360
 And my diary was like, "Your virtual guff trip starts today."

79
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
 And I was like, "Oh, I suppose it should."

80
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,400
 So I started setting up meetups and I now have meetups in Seattle on a stopover and in Perth,

81
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:43,600
 a couple of times in Perth and in Adelaide and in Melbourne, where we spent most of the time

82
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,160
 with the Melbourne fans, oh whoops, the Melbourne fans, schooling me on how you say the word Melbourne

83
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,640
 and me not really quite getting it.

84
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,880
 And then this morning Canberra.

85
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,000
 I still have to go to Sydney and then up the east coast of Australia to like all the bits that

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,640
 have lovely beaches and I want to do things.

87
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:11,200
 And then I also want to go to Hobart Tasmania, which is kind of a capital radio joke and doesn't

88
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,240
 really have anything to do with an actual love of Hobart at all, but I am going to get to Tasmania.

89
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,720
 And then I've got a couple of days in Turing, New Zealand before the actual Worldcon starts.

90
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,440
 Getting on to Australian time was really hard, but I'm on Australian time now and it's fine.

91
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,720
 When I've not been doing chats, because it's not just Zoom chats, I have obviously had

92
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
 a lot of appropriate Zoom backgrounds.

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,320
 I have started sketching, I should have started sketching earlier, but I didn't.

94
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,080
 But I haven't started sketching, so there are going to be some sketches of some of the things

95
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,600
 I'm seeing while I'm there.

96
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,240
 The primary thing I'm doing to experience the country is that I used my Oculus Quest,

97
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,600
 which has starred in previous episodes of OctaThorp as a way I was staying sane in the apocalypse.

98
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,280
 And now I'm using it.

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,360
 I create YouTube playlists of 360 degree videos that I shove my headset on and watch

100
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,320
 all these videos.

101
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,560
 Oh my god, it's like being there.

102
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,280
 It's not always like being there, but sometimes it's like being there.

103
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,080
 And this is very exciting to me.

104
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,080
 And as a result, I've got to experience a load of authentic,

105
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,560
 tourist experiences like going on a dolphin watching boat trip around Rocknest Island and

106
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,400
 walking around botanical gardens.

107
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,160
 So there's some things about Australia.

108
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,360
 Space is very big, but it doesn't have anything on Australia, which is absolutely bloody enormous.

109
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
 It's huge.

110
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,760
 Everything in Australia appears to be very big everywhere.

111
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,800
 All Australian cities have a set of things, and they seem to me to reflect

112
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
 colonial history to some degree.

113
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,080
 So they all have, apart from Canberra, they all have historical buildings,

114
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,320
 which seem like, to Brits seem like very ordinary Victorian architecture,

115
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,320
 that in the UK would be in severe danger of collapsing into disrepair or being torn down

116
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
 in order to make flats.

117
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,720
 But, but are kind of these are the exciting historical buildings in, in Australia.

118
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,960
 They all have a botanical gardens.

119
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,600
 They all have masses of park land, and they all have a jail which has been lovingly restored.

120
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,720
 Weird, weird detail.

121
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,480
 And they also have, they have a kind of big thing about colonial guilt and debt,

122
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,280
 which I'm just kind of getting my, my head around seeing as I feel like the British do not have

123
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,040
 as much of this despite the fact that we kind of cause, but in our psyche it's not such a big thing.

124
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,200
 And, and Australians are lovely and loads of them have come out to see me.

125
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,920
 And I've done, I've done some actual telepresence things where like going out into the Adelaide

126
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,920
 hills with Damien and Juliet while on Juliet's phone and wandering around the centre of Adelaide

127
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,880
 with Roman Ozutsky on Roman's phone.

128
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
 And I'm trying to think, do any of you have any questions about it?

129
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,800
 So overall it's going much, it's both better and more interesting than I expected.

130
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,520
 That's excellent.

131
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,160
 But I'm very tired now and it's only been a week.

132
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:25,760
 I have questions, so I am curious as to have you met anyone through this guff trip that,

133
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,920
 you know, were fans you didn't know previously or has it been hard to get people who don't already

134
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,760
 know you to come and join in? Whereas if you were there in person it might be easier to get them to

135
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,120
 come out to meetups, do you think?

136
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,000
 I'd say about the meetups have been half people I already know, but in some cases I only knew very

137
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
 faintly and half people I didn't know at all.

138
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,680
 That's a terrific ratio.

139
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,040
 So roughly even and lots of people I don't know.

140
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,720
 Some of them I feel I know quite well now.

141
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,600
 So I watched them not really properly well but a bit and this is how relationships form over

142
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
 long times don't they?

143
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,320
 So it's not just I had dinner with them and then now we're bussing friends forever normally.

144
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,800
 You kind of build these things over years.

145
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,000
 So there were people I'd met once or twice who I've now spent some more time.

146
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,520
 I watched an Aussie Rules football game of Erwin Hirsch said you must while you're out here,

147
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,680
 you must watch an Aussie Rules football game.

148
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
 So I discovered that you can stream them online.

149
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:29,200
 So I at one o'clock Sydney time or 4.05 am UK time I was watching

150
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
 Carlton play Port Adelaide.

151
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,040
 I think it's okay now to say the result because it will have been a few days but I've been quite

152
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:44,000
 careful which is that Port Adelaide won that at the point where the final whistle blew they had

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,840
 a free kick so they are allowed to take that free kick and they kicked it into the goal and

154
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,200
 and beat Carlton who is Erwin's team by three points.

155
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,800
 Oh that sounds good.

156
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,720
 So that was devastating for Erwin but I was like oh if you're going to watch a random game

157
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,840
 from a sport you've never seen before you could not have asked for a better one that is how sports

158
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
 should be.

159
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,400
 As far as I can see Aussie Rules football has everything a sporting a sports ball activity

160
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:19,680
 could require it is it is very fast pace a lot of points are scored nothing is properly in control

161
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,080
 ever and it is played by extremely beautiful people.

162
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,480
 There's a limit to what you could say in 2020 about bending two and a half hours

163
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,600
 ogling gorgeous men whilst talking to equally gorgeous Erwin Hirsch on discord.

164
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,200
 Oh this is how we get locks we just call our listeners gorgeous.

165
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,720
 This is how we get locks so I don't think that's offensive quite but I mean they're just lovely

166
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,600
 to look at and it's just very entertaining it's a good game I enjoyed it a lot.

167
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,800
 I am not much into sports ball I did have to pay I thought that was reasonable that's one of the

168
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,320
 biggest expenses I would say touring places virtually is very cheap compared to touring them in real life.

169
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,120
 Are you saying that your monthly broadband subscription costs you less than a flight

170
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,400
 halfway around the world? When I'm costing up the virtual guff trip which I am going to do I'm going

171
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:20,320
 to put things like my order for authentic New Zealand meat pies into the list of expenses but

172
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,600
 I'm not putting in either my broadband subscription which I was paying anyway or my Oculus Quest

173
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,520
 which I did not buy with this in mind at all it had never occurred to me I'd be using VR goggles

174
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,760
 to wander out bits of Australia and I've done some video diaries so um we should probably

175
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,640
 have a link to the video diaries on the show notes for people who feel that octa-thorp every

176
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:49,520
 two weeks is not enough allison for them. Yes Alison will now put the links in the show notes.

177
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,720
 I have six subscribers at the moment it's very exciting I'm kind of demonstrating how you fail

178
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,280
 to monetize. Yeah if you'd monetize this channel properly then you could actually be raising money

179
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,080
 for a guff while on your guff trip probably not really much maybe enough to cover your pie.

180
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,680
 That seems fair. That would be great that would be quite funny yeah I actually have more

181
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,640
 subscribers to my other channel to the channel I have under my under my Bohemian coaster name

182
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,680
 despite the fact that they're just totally random things I see that those subscribers are all bought

183
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,040
 so there's two videos so far one of them is saying no views which are a bit depressing.

184
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:33,040
 I think I really have no views. The the virtual guff report which you'll be very pleased to hear

185
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,720
 Claire Barley of Croydon has volunteered to edit for me is going to consist of a vast stack of

186
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,800
 bits and bobs thrown into an electronic carrier bag and tossed over the wall to her with a kind

187
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:54,000
 of if you can make any sets out of this you're doing well dear. Yes but it's gonna have an appendix

188
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,520
 on what the technology I've been using is and and to what extent that has worked. One of the things

189
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,640
 I've done is gone for a flying trip with the flying doctors because I am of an age where British

190
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,080
 people learned only a very few things about Australia growing up and one of the things we

191
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,080
 learned about was the flying doctors serve and now of course I live in Wolfham stow where we have

192
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,520
 our equivalent to the flying doctor service because it can take so long to get people the two miles

193
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,160
 from where they've been injured to a hospital they send a helicopter yeah so so it's it's much

194
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,520
 the same sort of thing except on a much smaller scale and it turned out that David Cakes wife

195
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,480
 Karen who I don't think I've met on this trip but I don't think I've met before spent a year

196
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,520
 working she she's an emergency doctor by trade and she said he spent a year in Alice Spring working

197
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,880
 for the flying doctor services this is the closest I've got to anyone who lives in the interior of

198
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,200
 Australia at all who is actually also an active fan um if you are listening to this podcast and

199
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,440
 you live in the interior of Australia and you're an active fan then please please get in touch

200
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,240
 because I would very much like to talk about what it's like to live in the desert yeah that's good

201
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,640
 sounds like you're having a good time on your guff trip I'm exhausted so tired

202
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:19,440
 Liz has posted a link in our show notes with a tweet that expresses some concerns about the

203
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,480
 Conzeland program and an open letter to Conzeland outlining and detailing those concerns

204
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:34,160
 Liz would you like to talk a little bit about what's going on here yes I mean I just happened to

205
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,640
 see this tweet retweeted on my feed today with a link to the open letter the discussion seems to

206
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,880
 be about essentially Hugo finalists and the use of Hugo finalists on the Conzeland program

207
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,480
 and it sounds like quite a lot of Hugo finalists have not really been offered things that are

208
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,440
 relevant to their expertise um or they they feel their panels do not have a diverse enough

209
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,760
 participants or a diverse enough framing of the topic of the panel and also it's it's not clear as

210
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,120
 to where the people can participate in programming without a full membership

211
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,000
 extension where they have to buy the full membership and of course this is all especially

212
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,680
 difficult because this is the first virtual world con and so there are going to be extra

213
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,080
 difficulties and problems associated with that but it sounds like coming this letter although

214
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:32,480
 not public are some suggestions for ways in which these problems could be mitigated yes and the

215
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,920
 tweeted question was posted by Alistair Stuart who is a nominee for sorry who is a finalist for

216
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:45,520
 best fan writer and people may know him as well for being a host on the escape pod family of

217
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,440
 podcasts my thoughts on this are good job mark protecting there John protecting the Hugo finalist

218
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,960
 mark yeah well you know you've got that bit sorry I just got because I was like Alistair's not

219
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:05,760
 called mark which is like mark plumber has done a number on my ability to accurately

220
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:14,880
 talk around by role on the mark protection committee um so the um I have thoughts about this I am a

221
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,360
 Hugo finalist as has been previously mentioned um I am not on the Conzeland program because I am

222
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,440
 not attending Conzeland I did get a program participant survey I think but I didn't fill it in because

223
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,880
 I'm not going um I in general can see the point that the signatories of the letter are making

224
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,480
 but I think my thoughts on this are neatly encapsulated by something that listener Emily

225
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,360
 January said to me it is in another place and another time which is that I understand the

226
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,720
 representation is very important and I want people who are not traditionally attendees of the world

227
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,960
 Conz feel like they're being invited in if they get nominated for Hugo's and I can see why having

228
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,040
 Hugo finalists on the program is really important but however I think that there is also an argument

229
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,720
 that the world con is by and for the World Con membership and so if someone is not a member of

230
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,080
 the world con it is not necessarily the case that they should be invited to be on the program if

231
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,800
 they haven't signed up so I think there is in some ways a clash here between um World Con as a thing

232
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,480
 that is put on by its members and the expectation that you will be invited even if you are not a

233
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,280
 member um and I think that is a complex discussion that kind of runs up a little bit about um the

234
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,200
 World Con style of having members instead of tickets and I wonder whether conventions that are more

235
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,000
 ticket-based might be skewing this conversation slightly in a way that is a little bit antithetical

236
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,760
 to how World Con's have traditionally worked and I do think that there is another um element here

237
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,280
 which Emily pointed out which is that she has chatted to newer conventionality attendees at

238
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,680
 Eastercons who she has said oh you'd be great on program and they've said oh I can't be on program

239
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,600
 I'm not an author and I think this idea that to be on program you need to be a professional or

240
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,680
 need to be recognized in some way is dangerous because I think in general programming is about

241
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,360
 putting interesting people on panels but having said all of that obviously people who get nominated

242
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,400
 for Hugo's and become Hugo finalists are perhaps interesting people who it would be good to have

243
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,840
 on panels so maybe those aren't antithetical concepts um so my thoughts on this are all very

244
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,360
 wishy washy and nuanced which is unhelpful for polemic allison before thrite I agree with everything

245
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:51,120
 that john said so I think oh dear some of the wishy washy stuff there is fine I also note that people

246
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,760
 are kind of like I got offered program but it wasn't the exact program item I wanted to do

247
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:04,240
 to which I would say that's the thing you can suck up yeah and but I also note that they say the

248
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,040
 program is not diverse enough and it doesn't feature die it doesn't have enough diversity in its

249
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,880
 range and scope and it doesn't have enough diversity of participants and that I think

250
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,200
 conzeland if it had got its act together four or five weeks earlier would have done well to have

251
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,560
 a think about it's now clearly too late for them to do that um some of the australian and

252
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:34,160
 new zealand fans i have spoken to have said you need to remember as well this is a new zealand

253
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:42,080
 wilcon and they are and I think 100% correctly for grounding australian and new zealand creators and

254
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:49,440
 fans in the program and that is that is absolutely the right thing for them to be doing part of what

255
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,640
 you do when you have a local wilcon is showcase what you are doing both professionally and fanishly

256
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,880
 in science fiction for the world and I think that's inevitably going to lead to some voices

257
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:14,800
 particularly voices from american participants not getting as much attention as they often do

258
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,760
 i might have no idea where alice to do it comes from he's he's british i should say the spread sheet

259
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,560
 is a private sedition of spreadsheets which i think is correct it was a correct way to do it

260
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,280
 there's an open letter and then they have probably sent a set of helpful suggestions to the program

261
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,200
 team which i think is absolutely the right way to do it well it's a good way it's a good way of

262
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,400
 doing it because it doesn't turn it into a giant muddslinging flight but it also implements concrete

263
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,360
 exact suggestions i think there's a few aspects of this one is i think it is normal or at least

264
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,520
 the normal when i've been involved to get in touch with all the qgo finalists who you know are

265
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,280
 attending to say hi would you like to do some program but part of this is about the hugo finalists

266
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,600
 who are not attending who do not have a comped membership but part of the issue is that usually

267
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,680
 because the expense of attending a wilcon is way more than just the membership it ends up being

268
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,200
 that even if you gave three memberships to every hugo every hugo finalist many of them still wouldn't

269
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,640
 be able to attend i feel like if they comped membership for every hugo finalist who was not

270
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,200
 already an attending membership they would have a much bigger problem on their hands than the problems

271
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,240
 that they currently find themselves because all the hugo finalists who that maybe at some

272
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,440
 considerable expense themselves because it's not cheap join the convention um this is another

273
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,920
 argument for why you should be eurocon and charge 10 euros for your membership i need

274
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,200
 still have a joyjip but i must do this or uk gave's expert charge absolutely nothing i mean i have

275
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,040
 had discussions about whether we should just be giving comped wilcon memberships to all qgo finalists

276
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,480
 like as a matter of policy and you know refunding the ones who already had memberships but it it does

277
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,920
 in any normal wilcon end up being quite a lot of your members there are quite a lot of hugo finalists

278
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,920
 as well and they're in fact increasing numbers of hugo finalists because we have a lot of multi editor

279
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,480
 um podcasts and and magazines which is great but it just just increased those numbers again so i

280
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,840
 think we worked out that you'd have to comp like a substantial fraction of the membership which would

281
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,400
 be an issue but with this being a virtual wilcon that issue is partly side step because you don't

282
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,000
 have a membership cap you don't have the physical facilities your costs are not as high so in this

283
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,320
 case i think they could consider comping every hugo finalist so my thought on this is effectively

284
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,520
 something that allison knows i have strong strong feelings on which is i i i i generally think

285
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,960
 this problem is being caused by the fact that the membership is far far too expensive um and

286
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,320
 the fact that we have seen like zero other science teaching conventions charged in excess of about

287
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,720
 thirty dollars and this one costs somewhere in the region of five times that is tricky and i

288
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,440
 sympathize for the consilent uh committee and there must be reasons they're doing that and i suspect

289
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,320
 those reasons are things they can't easily get out of but honestly i think the whole thing is being

290
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:21,200
 caused by the fact that this is a hell of a value proposition for a for a virtual convention um

291
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,760
 and i think it's difficult because you're quite right that in general comping hugo uh members uh

292
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,320
 hugo finalist memberships would not enable them to attend the convention anyways there's not much

293
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:40,240
 point doing it but this year it would be necessary to do that for most of them to attend and also

294
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,800
 it's the one year that doing it would mean they could participate so it changes the conversation

295
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,400
 a lot compared to normal um world cons and other virtual conventions running alongside the world

296
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,400
 con i have two thoughts that the first is that one of the things that has been a little less nice

297
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,920
 about my guff drip has actually been a bit sad is that i keep having conversations with people where

298
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:08,320
 i say and are you going to conziland and they and people are saying no it's it's far too expensive

299
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:16,160
 i can't do it and i was i kind of got used to those conversations in britain but i i have been

300
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:23,040
 quite sad and surprised by the extent to which i'm having them in australia and i think that's that

301
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,400
 it's really interesting because i had assumed the reason i was talking to a lot of british people

302
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,480
 who weren't going was because those people were not planning to go anyway but if people from

303
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,600
 australia and new zealand are not planning to go that says something quite significant i think about

304
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,880
 conziland's pricing structure because i would have expected anyone who had been planning to go to the

305
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,520
 world con to have been attending the virtual world con the people who already had attending

306
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:54,080
 memberships have kept them they did their their kind of partial refund system has worked in terms of

307
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,920
 keeping their attending members to the most part i don't think a lot of people who had attending

308
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:05,520
 memberships have have scrapped them but people who were were hoping to go or have not picked up the

309
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,160
 virtual membership just the same way that they haven't in in the uk as well so i thought that was

310
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,240
 bit sad um my second point was having said that they clearly cannot routinely conz membership for

311
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,680
 every hugo finalist because that enormous number of hugo finalists i think they might manage to

312
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:30,080
 conz membership for every hugo finalist who is not already an attending member and is from a

313
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,040
 marginalized group and suggests that they may have financial problems managing the cost of

314
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,880
 membership because i don't suppose that's actually going to be that many people so that that would

315
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,360
 have been a thing that they could do and certainly i don't know if this is true of world conz but in

316
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,680
 the uk we have an honorable tradition of having an un waged membership level which is available to

317
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:56,240
 you if you feel you need it rather than uh making it sort of a thing where you have to be able to

318
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,440
 prove that you need it which i think is in general a good model for doing that sort of thing we don't

319
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,080
 it's not a lot cheaper but it is something you could have the same system here where you say look

320
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,640
 if you are from a marginalized background and you know you you would like us conz membership we will

321
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,760
 do we're not going to ask questions you know we're not going to ask you to prove anything about it

322
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,920
 we just will uh so my other thought is that having only very briefly looked at the conz

323
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,400
 elan program because i'm not going it's it's got a lot of program items but i think it's still got

324
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,360
 quite a lot fewer than at a regular world con which i think makes sense i don't think you want

325
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,640
 like 15 to 20 program item running simultaneously i think you probably want five to 10 but it means

326
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,960
 there are many fewer spots on the program and i also wonder if they're having an issue of time zones

327
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,960
 because one of the things that has become increasingly difficult when programming

328
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:52,720
 world conz is trying to do the scheduling it is like a you know multi-week nightmarish jigsaw puzzle

329
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,840
 and that is with everyone in the same time zone to try and get everyone on items with the right

330
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,200
 people and the final time when all those people are available and at the con and you know there

331
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,560
 will always be commitments people have though people you don't like doing late evening panels

332
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,880
 people who don't like doing morning panels and so on and sometimes you do go okay this would be the

333
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,760
 ideal set of people for this panel but there is no time slot that actually works and so i have to

334
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,320
 change it up and i wonder if time zones are causing even more of a problem because if your ideal

335
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,040
 panel would have someone who's in europe someone who's in new zealand and someone who's in the usa

336
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:31,120
 that's going to be very difficult to do so i wonder if sometimes the way that they have solved

337
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,920
 problematic scheduling issues is to drop people who would otherwise be good on the panels and

338
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:43,360
 replace them with someone who just has more availability i i think i'm sure that the time zone scheduling

339
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,760
 has been an absolute nightmare and they can't you know i basically told them i would be on

340
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,320
 australia in uzland time but i've been given at least one panel on european time and luckily it's

341
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,440
 that it's at um ten o'clock at night New Zealand time because i'm kind of a late bird will probably

342
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,000
 be okay um but it's quite a serious panel and normally it's at a british convention i go on panels

343
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,120
 at ten o'clock at night and they're all the kind of lighter-hearted ones so i don't know whether

344
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,880
 how it's going to work in practice one other thing i wanted to point out uh so i was complaining about

345
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,560
 the cost of gonzeland relative to other online conventions and we mentioned that the euro

346
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:27,360
 gone this year is ten euros i will say that there's the opposite um the opposite problem occurs to me

347
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:34,000
 which is is this partly because we as a community are not devaluing our time as volunteers enough

348
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,320
 and we actually should be charging more than ten euros for what is probably really quite a lot of

349
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,280
 work um is this something where consi-land are actually charging an appropriate amount of money

350
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,640
 for what it is they're planning to put on and other conventions are so severely undervaluing their

351
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,520
 their offerings that consi-land is suffering as a result but we always undervalue our volunteer

352
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,440
 labor because we essentially put thousands of hours of volunteer labor and for no money all the

353
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,560
 actual cost that you pay for worldcon is going to the physical facilities and the paid staff of the

354
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,440
 venue it's not going to anyone organizing it so it would be a completely different model if you

355
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,960
 started charging for virtual conventions because of the volunteer time you're putting into them i

356
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,440
 can understand charging in order to make sure you have you know a sufficiently good zoom and

357
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,040
 discord license on so on but if if we're going to actually start saying okay and then we will

358
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,400
 somehow compensate people for volunteer labor you put in then you are one changing the whole

359
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,640
 model and two you're probably going to get yourself into a very sticky situation because of then

360
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,520
 employing people that's a good point i'm not sure if that was what you were proposing not as such i

361
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,760
 i guess i wasn't trying to argue that they should pay volunteers as if their employees but i do

362
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,360
 wonder to what extent conziland are using more services which do this sort of thing professionally

363
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,080
 because they partnered with the fantasy.network and people like that and i do wonder whether part

364
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,720
 of this disconnect is coming from this is an appropriate amount i need to spend for this sort

365
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,120
 of event but most other places are much more relying on volunteer labor to make it work okay so

366
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,120
 we always rely on volunteer labor to make things work i think collet conziland decided

367
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,440
 possibly correctly not possibly not so correctly that they didn't have the skills within fandom

368
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,200
 to do everything that they wanted to do and so would need to use paid labor for something that

369
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,640
 that would normally be um volunteer labor but in fact their primary things are you know we're

370
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,400
 going to send you an email with your zoom links in it we're going to be all discord i mean this

371
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,800
 doesn't seem to be that much different from what baltachol did and baltachol managed with its

372
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,120
 existing volunteer knowledge you know we've built up some knowledge in this area in the last few

373
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,640
 months i mean i don't i don't want to criticize conziland too strongly for a decision that they

374
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,160
 took under pressure i feel like they're doing their best job they can to run a good convention

375
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,320
 under extremely difficult circumstances but i feel like considering that we are all volunteers

376
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,800
 and we are generally happy to you know we muddle along in slightly good less less good hotels than

377
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,160
 we might and slightly less good circumstances than we might generally at conventions because

378
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:25,200
 we're actually after the volunteer feeling of it and and the relatively cheap thing i think that

379
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,840
 the model the models that we see going forward will be cheaper than gonziland they may not be as

380
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,640
 cheap as eurocon we'll have to see how that goes there are a lot of the professional conferences i

381
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,320
 might consider going to uh have gone online and their virtual registration rates are usually

382
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,440
 somewhere between sort of maybe 20 to 60 pounds so they are a cut above eurocon but they're not as

383
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,080
 much as conziland well and so this this actually neatly dovetails into the next point i was going

384
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,600
 to make which is is the other mistake potentially the conziland has made not relying on sponsorships

385
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,240
 because like the uk games expo is doing everything for free but they're being sponsored by some of

386
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,120
 the largest companies in the industry and a large part of the money they'll be spending to make

387
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:14,240
 their convention go is being provided by those companies now world cons have not traditionally

388
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,920
 relied on sponsorships and there are contentious discussions to have a power back and i have been

389
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,480
 present for some of those discussions even though i have a baby fan world con has an interesting

390
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:33,280
 sponsorship history which i think we should take another time but it is fair to say that in general

391
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,840
 but not always will cons have happily taken some money from publishers and anti-stikons for that

392
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,920
 matter but it's not normally there's not normally the amount of money flushing around in the industry

393
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:54,000
 that there can be if we were taking money from television or movie studios say so so publishing

394
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,760
 is more marginal generally however i remember having a chat with patrick lee lson hade of taut

395
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:07,440
 where the taranto world con was called talk on talk on two or talk on three and tour books basically

396
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,280
 went yet that will spot i see you have this range of possible sponsorships and sponsorship

397
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,000
 things can we have the biggest one please which i think is quite good they they weren't called

398
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,920
 talk on because of that but in general there are issue there are some sponsoring issues we we are

399
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,960
 not very good at at acquiring sponsorship and then finding appropriate ways to use it that don't

400
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:39,920
 worry our membership i think another good example of recent sponsorship is just san jose's sorry world

401
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,400
 con 76 colon san jose 2018 they had their hugo ceremony and it was sponsored by google and they

402
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:54,320
 gave a free google home to all of the hugo reception attendees that year and because google does not

403
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,320
 have an obvious conflict of interest with any of the kind of hugo finalists that went entirely

404
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,600
 unremarked upon and i think was generally a very good idea so maybe that's the other thing which is

405
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:13,200
 science fiction fandom in theory leans towards friendliness to technology and to other such things

406
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,760
 so perhaps going to a technology sector which is increasingly flush or maybe even going to somewhere

407
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,400
 like wetter who are obviously a homegrown New Zealand institution but aren't necessarily

408
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,680
 explicitly competing for any of the hugo categories there might have been options but it's very easy

409
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
 to quarterback these decisions when you're not the one making them under incredible pressure and i do

410
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,240
 i do think allison's point about that as well i realized one of the other things i do is the

411
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:45,360
 mit puzzle hunt and the mit puzzle hunt is the sponsor is entirely paid for really

412
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,760
 by sponsorship from tech companies and when these tech companies talk about why they sponsor the

413
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,920
 mit puzzle hunt it's like there is no better place to recruit in the world than by the sort of people

414
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,080
 who like spending three days of their weekend solving very hard puzzles for fun is it is it too

415
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,640
 soon to say easter con needs to think about going virtually we're back to normal by christmas

416
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,240
 allison don't you remember and we'll play football against the germans on on christmas day i've

417
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,480
 just been i've just been struck dumb by that thought that's so good sorry to anyone who does

418
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,880
 come to us for escapism for the sudden and unprovoked mention of boris jonson for which we can only

419
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,720
 afford choice oh i thought this was like off the record for planning for the next podcast so i'm

420
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,240
 not i'm not cutting that joe karl the podcast liz and now i think that bit about never gonna be

421
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,320
 playing we're going to play football with the germans on christmas day i thought was amazing

422
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,360
 we're going to turn the we're going to turn the virus off for an hour

423
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,040
 so we can all go out and play football

424
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:58,000
 yes fantastic but in fact i i i don't know if i'm the only person but i felt a real chill in my heart

425
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,480
 when johnson said we will have normality by christmas because i just went oh well we're not going to

426
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,440
 then clearly clearly that's his way of saying this will be the 2020 to 2024 pandemic

427
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:22,160
 i've done some reading i don't think we've got time to go through it in quite the detail

428
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,480
 of our previous episode which we talked about hugos i've read the hugo finalists for best novel

429
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,520
 with the exception of uh the light brigade which is the last one on my list i haven't quite got two

430
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,320
 yet and i'm about two thirds of the way through giddy in the ninth and i have read the other four

431
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,080
 i've been enjoying them generally i thought they are very high quality and i would be happy to see

432
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:50,720
 pretty much any of them win so far my favorite is maricold empire i was on a zoom yesterday

433
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,200
 with some friends in which i was decrying giddy in the ninth but it turns out it gets good about

434
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,400
 40 percent of the way through and now it has got good i am really enjoying it i will say that the

435
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,840
 beginning is a little bit of a slog and my wife keeps asking me whether it has gotten good yet

436
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:12,240
 i keep saying no be patient it gets there um i know that a lot of people think that's going to win i

437
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,480
 don't know if it will uh i think my favorite is as i said maricold empire i have uh read city in the

438
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,360
 middle of the night um and middle game so i think city in the middle of the night is probably my

439
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,720
 least favorite i liked it but um didn't quite do what charlie jane and does previous novel did for me

440
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,560
 quite a little game uh really liked maricold empire and the ten thousand dollars of january both of

441
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,800
 which i thoroughly enjoyed and thought were really really good and as i say giddy in the ninth i

442
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,640
 dike i think i like it better the middle game and city in the middle of the night but i don't think

443
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,560
 i like it quite as much as the ten thousand dollars of january or a maricold empire i'm wondering

444
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,720
 whether i'm going to enjoy the light brigade because my wife bounced very hard off it um but i will

445
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,680
 be reading that and hopefully next episode i will have some thoughts but yeah so far those are my

446
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,760
 thoughts about best novel i'll just want to very quickly outline them to show that i do read

447
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,360
 yay even when i'm not on trains that's probably a little bit longer than three minutes but that's

448
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,560
 mostly because i got our dc fontana episode mixed up with the challenge in anders book i thought

449
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,040
 you were going to do all the hugo categories and i was like shit jane i need dinner at some point

450
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,640
 i i have read some of the hugo stuff but nothing like enough um one of the

451
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,800
 i accidentally found myself in a discussion of best novella at one of the zoom chats i've been in

452
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,840
 the um a critical mass um and they they found it quite interesting because they said we all

453
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,920
 like this one the best but we don't think it will win we think this one will win and i thought

454
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,320
 that's very interesting they kind of had this notion that the hugo voters are voting as a as a

455
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,320
 conglomerated agglomerated mass that do not vote for the best thing but whenever i voted in the

456
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:03,360
 hugos and be really really keen to see something amazing win it's either one or or or come second

457
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,880
 to something else very solid so i'm not sure i agree with them but i am i have stored their

458
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,280
 prediction away and i will i will be watching the hugos carefully reveal in an envelope after the

459
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:22,400
 hugos next episode and i'm giving out a hugo i'm so excited i i had forgotten that that was a thing

460
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,160
 they make guff delegates do how do you how do you give out a hugo on zoom no it's great i when i gave

461
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,240
 a hugo to claire it was brilliant even if i did pronounce the name wrong i am i am very excited

462
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,960
 about handing out a hugo even though it's obviously going to be a virtual thing which category are

463
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,880
 you handing out i am handing out best fan artists oh excellent that's a really yes excellent i did

464
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,920
 get around to listening to episodes of at least one but mostly two or three episodes of all six

465
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,800
 of the best fan cast hugo finalists and i wrote an article about it which is is compliment is

466
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,000
 reasonably complimentary about all of them i think it's a it's an overview article at Glasgow

467
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,280
 2024's blog um and i was quite interested in them i wanted to say a little bit here about them because

468
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:22,560
 it turns out that most of these um fan cast are people talking about books or movies or

469
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,360
 television shows and sometimes that could be very interesting but generally while it is all very

470
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:34,720
 well it is not my primary interest in science fiction fandom i realized what i was listening to

471
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:42,880
 these um so hence i'm i don't notice that um lillian and christina and diana are out there doing a

472
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,960
 fan fan cast about everything else in the world now so maybe we can encourage other people to do

473
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,840
 theirs too so we can have a whole network of people do fan cast that aren't just talking about the

474
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,800
 books they'd be reading uh so this never happens is the name of an excellent fanish podcast done by

475
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,440
 lillian edwards and christy lake uh and they may be sad because they reminded me that my duo lingo

476
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,400
 street could gone away um i had a multi-hundred day duo lingo street and it went away over christmas

477
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,040
 uh because i was very busy and i forgot to do it two days in a row and yes it went way very sad um

478
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:24,400
 but i now know the spanish pre-to-write tense because i have been learning my spanish with an app called

479
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:31,360
 Anki so um anki which liz recommended to me and it's very good for learning languages and whatnot

480
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:39,200
 and other things you could do for later uh mark up i i use i use anki for many i mean i don't actually

481
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,800
 but when i am trying to learn thing i set up anki deck for the things that i'm trying to learn

482
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,680
 so for example i have an anki deck where i just the anki deck shows me the name of a dance that

483
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,160
 our morris side does and i play the tune for it on my melodian so that i can remember how all the

484
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,440
 tunes start so that we don't have that embarrassing thing where the dancers are standing around going

485
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:10,080
 okay musician please play the eightteenth of may and i go you can't see on the video on the audio but

486
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,920
 but but that that is a very embarrassing thing for musicians to be doing but it's not uncommon for

487
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,960
 musicians what we will do is we'll take a photo of allison looking confused and we'll put it in

488
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,760
 the show notes now so like look at you look at your podcast app look at it now it's got away now

489
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:34,160
 look at my fully functional latex using anki deck there whoa you're gonna have to take a screenshot

490
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,440
 of that and send it to me please oh is that latex tie well no it's latex for transliterated

491
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,400
 tie because this is from back before i could read but the transliterations require me of the

492
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,600
 method my school uses requires more than just a standard alphabet so it's got a you with a line

493
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:57,680
 through it which represents the ew vowel okay so when you said latex i was like oh i guess you could

494
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,200
 use that for learning how to write maths but i learned how to write maths by just writing the

495
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,120
 latex when i needed it and looking up things to find out the next bit of latex i needed

496
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,400
 for the next bit of math it had not occurred to me that anyone used latex for anything other than

497
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,520
 math i use it for work obviously uh well that's maths did it i'm doctor the boy who who go

498
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,120
 finalist coxern yeah but you you use long words like magnetosphere and magneto hydroton alex

499
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,080
 but drichrag is kicking and screaming back to the topic which is it's interesting that i think

500
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,000
 allison has reached i don't know maybe there's like a first level of fandom where you actually spend

501
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,680
 lots of time talking about the books and the television and the movies which may be where the

502
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,080
 start of your fandom and then at some point you move on to this this higher level i listen

503
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:49,200
 as reached where you're now sort of meta fandom um because you're sort of wanting fan

504
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:56,480
 fan cast that talk about fandom oh i i i think one of the fan cast sometimes the fan cast get into

505
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:03,680
 the material business of science fiction so what it is that we are doing when we do science fiction

506
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,880
 and i find that a lot more interesting and all of the all of the fan cast do this sometime it's

507
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,360
 not that some of them do it but but so a fan cast will go almost seamlessly from in this book there

508
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,880
 are a boy and a girl and one of them turns out to be the the hero in disguise and the book tells

509
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,320
 of their adventures through the planet nor um i'm paraphrasing but not as much as you might want

510
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:33,120
 and then they'll suddenly go into and it's very interesting the way that this book compares with

511
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:39,600
 the same sorts of themes being talked about 20 or 30 years ago and at that point i'm riveted

512
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:46,800
 and i can't quite find a way to get please stop talking about the plots of the books or why you

513
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,840
 find them exciting and stop talking about what it is that is what it is that is going on critically

514
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:59,360
 so for people in board game fandom this this reminds me a great deal of the difference between

515
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,400
 the dice tower reviews and the shut up and sit down reviews on youtube because the dice tower does

516
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,400
 great reviews in which he goes through the rules and explains what he likes and dislikes about them

517
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,960
 which i find very dull and shut up and sit down talk about games and how they make you feel and

518
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,640
 how they can paint it how they compare to other games that might have made you feel similar things

519
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,040
 or different things and what the differences are and the latter is fascinating as something i thoroughly

520
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,240
 enjoy listening to in both science fiction and board games and the former is is not something i'm

521
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,040
 as interested in guys because i think of it as a difference between a book report and a book

522
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,080
 review in a way and that they are aiming to do different things and and giving me a different

523
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,760
 a different interpretation i think part of the reason i like panel discussions at convention so

524
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,880
 much is because you tend to get that kind of wide ranging discussion of themes and juxtapositioned

525
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:53,920
 and and it helps you contextualize your um your reading and the reading you've done with reading

526
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,360
 you haven't done and like draws parallels and and helps you explore the genre um whereas a book

527
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:05,120
 report talks a lot about a book which is valuable but i don't find as compelling i think that's fair

528
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,560
 i hope that's fair i want to also mention when you're talking about um gaming podcasts i like i

529
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,760
 like tabletop which is a a video a youtube series rather than which is the will-wheaten thing because

530
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,520
 they just play gay in an entertaining fashion so i assume they play games for hours and then edit

531
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,240
 it so you only actually see the good bits but i feel like i end up with a sense both of

532
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,680
 these people are enjoying themselves which is always quite engaging but also whether this game

533
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,760
 is worth playing or not which is something that i'm quite keen to get out of out of gaming podcast

534
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:49,920
 next time we recall this podcast we are inviting all of you to join us for episode 11 of the octal

535
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:58,480
 podcast that will be being recorded on the second of august at 12 noon british time that's british

536
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,760
 summertime and we will be putting a link to that on facebook and if you're clear and mark we will

537
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,560
 be emailing you a link because we know you're not on facebook and if there's anyone else who's not

538
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:16,960
 on facebook um get in touch and we will email you as a link as well it is not just clear and mark

539
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,040
 but we don't want to put the link just openly on the internet because you know how it

540
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,920
 so if you'd like to come send us send an email to the email in the show notes or find the

541
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,320
 event in our facebook group and i would expect that after we finish doing the proper recording

542
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:38,720
 part of the podcast there will be a trivial chat part of the podcast because those seem to work

543
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,120
 quite well as well and you'd be very welcome to stay around for that or in fact come to that without

544
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:47,920
 coming to live podcast that would be fine yeah we can't tell you when it starts it will start

545
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:58,240
 sometime between 45 minutes of three hours to true true true true okay so that was the 10th episode

546
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,480
 of the octal podcast and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me but it's good a from me i'm in

547
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:11,440
 australia the theme music for this episode was fanfare for space by kevin mccloud at ncompetech.com

 used under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license

549
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:28,240
 and i'm like well there will be written you know there is some written stuff and i have

550
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,320
 i've written up a couple of anecdotes about the trip like when i got off my zoom chat today at 1129

551
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:41,920
 1129 uk time i won't say where it was in the place i was um my daughter said to me did you really

552
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,280
 have another chat to go to at 1130 and i said no having forgotten that we were recording octa 4

553
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,440
 but prior to that she said because it's really interesting because you said oh i need to let you

554
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,720
 go because you have her you've told me that you've got a draft to submit to before world cod and

555
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,080
 you have a load of work to do and you said oh i really should be spending i only get a couple of

556
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,800
 hours to spend with my family before i fall asleep those are the couple of hours i'm currently

557
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:15,840
 spending recording the podcast but let's let's move that away and you said oh and and she she just

558
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:23,600
 reeled off the many increasingly fretful excuses i'd use to try and get this lovely but but ever

559
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:30,640
 continuing person off zoom chat without success before going no gotta go 1130 is this by any chance

560
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:39,360
 not for the podcast i feel like i feel like it's probably okay because i don't think the person

561
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,000
 in question is going to realize this was them and if they did do then we're very sorry

562
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,880
 but i'm just gonna say here's it's one of these british things if a british person says i need to

563
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:57,680
 let you get on or i'm taking up too much of your time it means we're done now can we can we stop

564
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:03,920
 or if you say briskly right that that means goodbye like and it would be very useful if everyone was

565
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,840
 aware um no i i know but sometimes right means i'm thinking of leaving and i'm gonna look like i'm

566
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,120
 leaving but actually i'm gonna stay in chat for another half an hour maybe have one more beer and

567
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,840
 then go yeah no i mean i think i use the word right and enormous about right just generally means i've

568
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:23,600
 actually had a thought then i'm like i'm not gonna tell you um so the the i have i have become very

569
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,120
 good on zooms uh just put it in the chat i have to go down by and they're just collecting which i

570
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:35,840
 view as the zoom equivalent of an irish goodbye and i feel very useful um but yes an irish goodbye

571
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,160
 where you leave a party without saying goodbye that's an irish goodbye right i think so yeah you

572
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,080
 just leave because you know it would take you half an hour to go and say goodbye to everyone you just

573
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:51,120
 kind of duck out we shall put a link in the show notes i believe i was i learned a couple of years

574
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:56,320
 ago that there is great merit in not saying goodbye to people but just leave and i think that's

575
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,760
 even probably even more true on zoom i mostly do that at conventions with a few adorable exceptions

576
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,560
 i usually say goodbye to liz because she's from far away these days um so anyway other questions

577
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:11,040
 about the guff trip yes now you're going to be camping in whales while on your guff trip how does

578
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,480
 that work we decided that while we have this window where it's possible for us to see our elderly

579
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,280
 relatives we should do that and so we're going to be camping close my in-laws so you're agal

580
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,840
 so you're going to go camping with your relatives while on your guff trip no no we're camping near to

581
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,480
 where my relatives live but do not have enough house space okay for enough i mean that's not that

582
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,320
 exciting so i think what i'm going to do is get up dawn there is a problem i there's a not a lot

583
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:44,080
 of time after that and before worldcon starts i think the start of worldcon might be very hard for me

584
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,920
 that so my current plan is to rise at first light which is about four and go to go to sleep or maybe

585
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:58,080
 slightly before i am determined to see this bleeping comet just look which i've kind of like i'm up

586
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,440
 in the middle of the night i ought to be able to see a comet but my my house and garden and location

587
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,200
 have other ideas i'm going to need to move a little bit away from borford stone i managed to see it by

588
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,320
 just going to our local park which is not particularly unlike polluted but i imagine that

589
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,280
 salamton's light pollution is less than london's in general no i mean i think

590
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,440
 Simon bison had no problem in puttney but anyway north whale should be no oh yeah you'll be fine i

591
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,080
 mean it's it's next week rather this week but i don't think it's going anywhere i know that comets

592
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,800
 are slightly they do move obviously i mean you're you're professor the boy coxor must know all about

593
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,920
 comets right yeah the big balls of ice and stuff yeah no that bit i do know um so yes

594
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,400
 comet neo-wise is visible closest approach to earth is on the 23rd of july which is in four days

595
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:52,400
 time as we record probably the day or the day after we um released this episode um if you're listening

596
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,760
 to it uh so yeah you should be able to get good views then but i was able to see it with the naked eye

597
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:04,800
 before last um and i managed to take a very good photo on my phone so i was very happy and i'm hoping

598
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,320
 that i will be able to use my phone to take an adequate photo just before dawn in north whale

599
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,880
 you'll be fine you've got the same camera as me i have a brand new phone i mean it's an old phone

600
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,200
 but it no you don't have the same camera as me you've got the one before mine but you should still be

601
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:26,480
 fine i've got the i the new iphone se it should be perfectly up for taking photographs of comet yes

602
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,720
 just take a tripod or something because of their second exposure will do you wonders oh yeah no i'll

603
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,480
 just probably push on a bean bag that works i put it on one of those trees scaffolds you get for

604
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,600
 very young trees and that worked fine i mean i'll i'll sift on something so so no i am just home

605
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,600
 and see but otherwise i'm trying to just get up at first light or just before first light to

606
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,160
 take pictures of comet and then go to bed mid evening and not enjoy my evenings but you know what

607
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,200
 i mean we're staying with we're staying in the field of peat and carol peat crump and his wife

608
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:04,080
 carol and carol and tops i'm not crump and um and i i the whole part thing about sitting in a garden

609
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:10,320
 enjoying a beer with some is a lot more fun before it gets dark this is an activity that stops being

610
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,680
 fun at nightfall so i think if i just kind of stay awake from sunrise to sunset it will it will be

611
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:22,080
 reasonably okay for for australia in new zealand i'm not i'm not doing the bits of the tripway

612
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:28,560
 you'd be traveling or hanging out in people's houses doing your laundry or did this one to

613
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,960
 ask me any questions about guff singers i love nothing more than talking about myself that bit

614
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,560
 is really not for the podcast oh that's going in that's a hundred percent going in that might be the

615
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:46,720
 episode title no i think i'm curious to talk to you in another two weeks when you will presumably be

616
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:53,840
 almost completely dead oh yes we should plug the live episode the live episode yeah we need to talk

617
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,520
 about our live episode coming from um lizz's house where you're going to send me some backdrop photos

618
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,720

619
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,200
 have to tidy my house it's not it's not very exciting though i mean it's just a house i could

620
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,360
 could probably steal some photos off the internet okay so what would be even better

621
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:18,000
 might be a coffee can you go out for coffee with people at the moment yeah so i could like

622
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,120
 have a photo from a coffee shop in tylor lizz you need to send me an allison virtual

623
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:30,400
 backgrounds so that we can all be in the same place when we do our live recording all right okay

624
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:37,200
 okay is that the view from your house do i have a number of foot uh this is the view from the

625
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,320
 training station so i've for those of you cannot see which is everyone because this is a podcast

626
