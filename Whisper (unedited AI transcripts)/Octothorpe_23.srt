1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
 Yeah, I think this whole thing is about not funny digression and we should just like move on.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,440
 I mean, I wasn't listening, so that's who speak.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,520
 That's a pre episode thing, isn't it?

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:29,200
 Hello, everyone, and welcome to the 23rd episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,080
 I'm John Coxon.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,080
 I'm Alison Scott.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,400
 And I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:45,000
 And we have letters of comment this week from two old suspects, no familiar suspects, no old familiar people.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,920
 And we also have one from a new suspect.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,280
 I believe that also our letters of comments are going to be incorporated into also corrections corner.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,760
 Thank you to our commenters for pointing out several things we got wrong in the last podcast.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:10,200
 Yes, so we'll start with Chris Garcia, who points out that Alison was wrong about Monument Valley and it is in fact, fantastic.

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,960
 So thank you for that.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:22,120
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Chris. Okay, did he say why? Should I read this? He says, he says, he says my son John Paul is exceptionally good at it, much better at it than using the potty.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,960
 So, Alison, I think we can safely declare that it's a great game.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,160
 Well, I mean, I didn't realize that the better at using the potty was the criterion because that changes everything.

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:40,240
 I think I'd be quite bad at using the potty because I imagine most of them are designed for asses that are smaller than mine.

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,080
 This is a disturbing digression.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,480
 So he also says that I am exactly right about gloom haven. So this is my favorite letter of comment.

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,800
 Actually, it's not. And I got in trouble on a discord for saying something else with my favorite of comment.

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,560
 So obviously, my favorite letter of comment is always Claire's.

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,400
 I would like to call out from Chris's letter that he says to him.

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,720
 Haven is completely average in a fairly average way, which is just my favorite phrase this week.

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,440
 He also pointed out that we forgot completely to mention the last of us part two as a candidate for best games.

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,800
 Hugo, this is probably because I am currently stuck somewhere in the middle of the last of us part one with not enough ammo and I've given up.

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,480
 So he also says that he doesn't think animal crossings new horizons will win.

27
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,960
 He's wrong, but who knows whether we'll even have a hugus already at any rate.

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:42,960
 Spoilers for layers, spoilers for later listener and posted on her Twitter because and we will link to this in the show notes.

29
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,200
 She got a notification from her podcast app in which it said, Oh, 22.

30
00:02:48,200 --> 00:03:02,280
 I sometimes bum and and she had questions and we would like to apologize to and for the title of last episode and the unfortunate way it was cut off by her podcast app of choice.

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,880
 Is that really something we need to apologize for?

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,720
 Well, apologizing for it.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,520
 Let's just put it in in a way that isn't just her bum.

34
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,160
 Yeah, bum.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,240
 Bums are funny.

36
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,160
 We're bum.

37
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,320
 OK, yeah, fair enough.

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,600
 Name of the name of the podcast.

39
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,760
 Possibly.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:28,640
 OK, and then we have our letters of comment from Mark and Claire from Croydon.

41
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:37,600
 Mark says it's probably a little late in the season to express the sentiment in this way, but oh, no, we won't be checking the hugos this year.

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,720
 That is.

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
 So yes, we were incorrect.

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,920
 Mark and Claire have done it in previous years, but are not doing it for 2021 and therefore presumably haven't been able to resign.

45
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,120
 But again, spoilers for later.

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:58,720
 And Mark also says that he has joined Eastcom as a virtual member, but that is a lot because he always goes to Eastcom.

47
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:08,000
 And that Trump's his sense of, but what's the value proposition, which I think I think to a large extent is also why I joined like immediately because I always join immediately because he's gone.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:21,240
 He also says we were wondering whether or not they had edited the announcement and he says that he knows that it said on the 11th of October that it said what it says now because he had caused quote from it.

49
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,320
 And so the text hasn't changed.

50
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:34,640
 And I think that speaks to the ease with which it is possible to communicate something in plain English that then you do not communicate in a way that people actually hear properly.

51
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,960
 And I think a lot of us in the community were hearing Eastcom saying they didn't have a lot of virtual plans.

52
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,360
 And that does seem to run counter to the stuff they were like they wrote in this statement, but it definitely wasn't the impression we were getting in the community.

53
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,000
 And I think that might be a topic we can touch upon later.

54
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,320
 For reasons connected to other conventions.

55
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
 A lot of foreshadowing this week.

56
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,840
 Yes, we're good at it, Liz.

57
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,320
 Yeah, Mark also gives us some clarification about about accounts.

58
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,920
 It may be that we're the only people who are hung up about Eastcom accounts or convention accounts generally because.

59
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:20,320
 Claire and Mark were the only people who mentioned it and we already know they're very interested in it and we are very interested in it.

60
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:28,560
 That may mean that our audience generally isn't that interested in it, but I still think it's super important stuff.

61
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,440
 All conventions should publish accounts into course.

62
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,280
 I'm sure punctuation will any minute now.

63
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,120
 We're actually still getting money in for punctuation, which I don't entirely understand.

64
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:49,480
 It's because stripe keeps like some percentage of your money for two months or something in case.

65
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,480
 Something bad happens.

66
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:59,920
 And so basically we had, I think, about two thirds of the money we had made from memberships available to us at the time we ran the convention.

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,240
 And now we are getting the rest of the money.

68
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,560
 OK, that explains it.

69
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,080
 So so we should probably be able to finalize the accounts in the next month, I think realistically.

70
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,920
 But I think the other thing I want to say is this is also one of the reasons why it's not possible to run this sort of event at cost.

71
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,240
 You have to run it above cost and then plan to donate.

72
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,040
 Oh, we may have to take this offline because I hugely disagree with that statement.

73
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,920
 So that's part of why we have passed along funds though, for long standing things.

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:39,680
 We don't have any for punctuation, but we could perfectly well have run punctuation by running into debt and then having the money following later.

75
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
 That is not the reason you can't budget at cost.

76
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,760
 I think that but it is a reason you can't write like if you don't have a credit card.

77
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,040
 But there are for example, the League of Fan Funds will give you money to cover that sort of thing.

78
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:04,600
 As an example of the way that you could cover it, there are ways in which you can manage not having all of the funds you need come in fast enough,

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,000
 including using a payment service that does give you the money and time to run the event which do exist.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,520
 They just take more of a cut.

81
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
 So there are several ways in which you can handle it.

82
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,680
 That aren't just plan to make a profit.

83
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
 OK.

84
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,840
 I think this does all tie into publication of the EasterCon accounts because we may say we're the only,

85
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,560
 you know, none of our listeners apart from our shareholders letters indicating strong preferences for it.

86
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,560
 But if I was coming into fandom and I wanted to try running an EasterCon,

87
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:39,640
 then one, it would be very important for me to know the financial state of kind of the EasterCon pass along and how we've been doing over the past few years

88
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,720
 and to know what people have been budgeting for different areas of the con,

89
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,040
 otherwise it's very hard to know that.

90
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,920
 And also you say there are organisations like the League of Fan Funds that will help you,

91
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,080
 you know, if you need a float to be repaid later because of payment terms.

92
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,120
 But you also need to know that you can go and contact the League of Fan Funds and they would be happy to do that,

93
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
 which you might not necessarily know.

94
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
 Well, they might or might not be happy to do that.

95
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,360
 But I think at this point, if somebody asked the League of Fan Funds for a float,

96
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,680
 we would be going, oh, yeah, that sounds like a plan.

97
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,040
 Yeah, I'm not committing into anything, but just organisations,

98
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,160
 which will do stuff like that, you have to know they exist and might be able to help you before you can go to them.

99
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,360
 So the more public account information, the better.

100
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,720
 As chair of the 2018 EasterCon, it feels like it's time.

101
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,400
 I will get in touch with my treasurer and say, what is now stopping us from publishing our accounts

102
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,480
 and see if we can't get that sorted by, say, Easter.

103
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,280
 That's a public statement.

104
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,040
 Oh, you heard it here first, folks.

105
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,960
 Dolly, the treasurer did so.

106
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,040
 Probably did also tell the treasurer.

107
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,480
 I know that the treasurer knew that we had an intention to get it done in a year.

108
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,680
 So, you know, I think while I agree with Alison's core point that you can charge your members less money

109
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,760
 if other organisations give you money, I am not sure that raises my core point of this stuff's difficult.

110
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,320
 That sigh was beautiful.

111
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
 John's do you ringtone?

112
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
 Yes.

113
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,040
 I'm being I'm being facetious, obviously.

114
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:25,160
 It is certainly I am not prepared to concede the general point that when starting up a convention for the first time,

115
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,480
 you need to have a plan to soak your members.

116
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:36,720
 There are, you know, that is one way in which you can you can cope with the fact that starting up a convention for the first time

117
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,760
 is is a risky affair.

118
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,600
 I would say that I think that punctuation made a larger profit as a proportion of membership than any project

119
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,360
 I've ever been involved on in my life.

120
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,000
 And I'm only very slightly embarrassed about that because it was only a fiver.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,360
 Yes.

122
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,160
 Anyway, we have digressed and we have I mean, shockingly,

123
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,040
 although to be fair, we digressed onto a non-topic topic.

124
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,920
 I think it's also important to publish accounts because that way, if you're later going to make arguments

125
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,360
 that some things you might want to do are too expensive, you've got the evidence right there in his in historical accounts

126
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,480
 to support that argument.

127
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,800
 Ah, true.

128
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,840
 It's more foreshadowing, isn't it?

129
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,120
 It's more foreshadowing. That's true.

130
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,040
 So we're on to Claire's letter.

131
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,040
 Claire writes to say, yes, that is true.

132
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,400
 Any type of infutur messages from me are, of course, deliberate mistakes designed to catch you out.

133
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,840
 Although I'd always intended that multiple grammatical and punctuation areas would be the way I'd indicate that I was being made

134
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
 very under duress.

135
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,480
 So maybe it's not such a good plan.

136
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:48,720
 So just to reassure you, then, if there are any mistakes in this email, there are either tests or hilarious jokes and not a sign I'm changed to a radiator.

137
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,320
 Claire, if you're being held under duress, please ask your captors to send us your customary video letter of comment.

138
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:09,520
 Claire also reiterates what Mark said about not being in on the Hugo checking this year and also wrote to us about the value of publishing these two con accounts.

139
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:21,920
 She also says that she needs to point out a misspelling of Karen Schafer's surname because we referred to Karen and her partner Mike in last episode as Karen Ward and Mike Schafer,

140
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:30,040
 instead of referring to them as Karen Schafer and Mike Ward, which at least it is clear that we are not instruments of the patriarchy, but it is also clear.

141
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,880
 We're daft.

142
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,400
 So thank you very much for pointing that out, Claire.

143
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,440
 We could we could we could avoid this problem by not making any mistakes next time.

144
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,680
 We're very sorry and we will never make any mistakes ever again.

145
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,640
 On the subject of never making any mistakes ever again.

146
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,560
 All fandom was plunged into war.

147
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:13,680
 What happened was as far as I can reconstruct this is a disc on three who are the 2021 Worldcon announcing new policy for Hugo finalists, which would be that they would announce all the names as part of the souvenir book and program and on the website.

148
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:26,280
 And they would all get pins and ribbons, but when we actually list the final nominees on the ballot and you know on the PowerPoint at the Hugo ceremony and on the trophy blacks, they would only list up to four names.

149
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,720
 And this made quite a lot of people quite annoyed.

150
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:43,760
 This is because there are you know a large number of nominees for the Hugo's, especially in the fanzine and semi-prozine and bandcast categories, where increasingly more than four people have been listed as

151
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:54,560
 creators of the works in question and why I think this gone through meant to say more prominently yes and we're going to list all these names in the souvenir book and in the program and on the website.

152
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,000
 What they actually said was when the PowerPoint comes up with your name as a nominee, we're only going to list four of you.

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,160
 And when you get invites to parties and so on, we'll only list four of you.

154
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:13,440
 And so this made a lot of the larger teams quite annoyed and and we'll just we'll discuss why this got made these changes and whether we agree with them in a minute.

155
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:24,280
 But it may quite have been quite annoyed, especially ones who pointed out that you know they were really very proud of having won the Hugo award and would not have been listed if this policy was in effect in their years.

156
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:36,960
 Also pointing out there are a lot of minority creators who are involved with these these particular categories who would not have been listed on the in the finalist if this policy was in place.

157
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:53,680
 This policy stayed in place for approximately 24 hours at which point this gone through apologized listed all the steps they were going to take to address the problems that they have caused and apologize that people for speaking out about it.

158
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,520
 And I think it seemed like that was that at least for a few days.

159
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,600
 It did.

160
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:13,720
 But maybe before we continue, maybe we should discuss a little bit this policy that this can had and why we think we had this policy and whether we think this policy was a good idea or not.

161
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:30,720
 Reading the tweets from this con, I think it calls to mind the thing we discussed a little while ago in the letters of comment, which is the things that they say and the focus of the ensuing discussion were it was very clear that people were discussing the feeling they got from what

162
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,800
 this con has said rather than the sort of nuts and bolts.

163
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:45,720
 And that is to say that like this gone are very clear in their announcement that all creators named to the convention as part of a here at finalists will be listed in the book, the serving program and on the websites and would receive a pin and a ribbon.

164
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:57,320
 They specifically say that they will only list up to four names for each finalist on the paper ballot on the ceremony visuals and on the trophy plaque and they conspicuously do not mention whether every finalist will get a trophy.

165
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:12,200
 And I think if they meant that not every finalist would get a trophy, then that is something where I can understand why the conversation that ensued really did focus on the kind of people who had won trophies in the years they were nominated to would be excluded by this policy.

166
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:21,280
 And I think if they did not mean to indicate that only four people would be allowed to have trophies, then this was an enormous own goal of communication that they should have anticipated.

167
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,160
 I will say that I have been nominated for Hugo's under the team journey planet banner.

168
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,000
 I've edited three journey planets to on Star Wars and one on the matrix.

169
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:43,360
 I really like editing journey planet and it gives me access to a community of writers and editors and a kind of a well to tap that I would not be able to access.

170
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:51,960
 Otherwise, especially with James Bacon's sources in the Irish comic industry and Chris's contacts in kind of California and Hollywood.

171
00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:03,400
 And I think that in the years when I have been nominated, I have either been eligible to get a rocket or I have been eligible to pay a search charge for a rocket.

172
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:15,600
 So I think it was Dublin, but it might have been San Jose who basically said we're going to make up to five rockets per listed finalist and anyone kind of in excess of that number.

173
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,840
 Like, we're quite happy to, you know, let you pay us to make more rockets if you'd like more than that for your group.

174
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,080
 And I'm not sure kind of where in that spectrum, Discon 3 was.

175
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,040
 But yeah, I think, I think they really did need to, I think, make it clearer.

176
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,240
 If this was literally just, we can't list 26 people on this very small bit of text.

177
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,520
 They really need to make it clearer that that was the main drive.

178
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:50,040
 And if that isn't the main drive, I think they needed perhaps to say that and to open a dialogue about that that wasn't, we have decided this thing.

179
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,240
 But perhaps other people on the podcast disagree with me.

180
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,240
 I think I do disagree somewhat.

181
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,200
 So back in the midst of time, there was only one rocket.

182
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:11,600
 And I think what's one of the things that's happening here is that we've got people are talking as if fans have just invented the idea of large team efforts and

183
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,440
 collaborations. And it's just not true.

184
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:20,880
 We give Hugo's for movies, which obviously have many thousands of people working on them because that's what it takes.

185
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:34,320
 But even a novel, it's well understood, I think, that when you give an author a best novel Hugo, that's a huge collaboration that involves a lot of work from a lot of people, not least of which is their editor.

186
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,760
 We've actually talked in the past about surfacing who's editing, who's editing the things that are winning awards.

187
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,800
 But it could also involve a translator.

188
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,480
 It certainly involves artists and publishers and copy editors and all manner of things.

189
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:59,800
 And the notion that just because you have somebody's name on something, it doesn't mean it's a joint effort, or that somehow diminishes the joint effort.

190
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:10,760
 I don't, I just feel like we're kind of going, oh, well, it's if you've got a team of, and if you have a team of 40 people, we should be celebrating all 40 of those equally.

191
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,640
 That that's not the way it works.

192
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:23,240
 I mean, so originally they gave out a rocket and that might have been an individual thing or it might have been a, it certainly involved in all the one person.

193
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,520
 I don't think there's anything.

194
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:32,440
 Maybe, maybe some fanzines are in fact the entire work of one person, but almost everything on there is going to be more than that.

195
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:40,440
 And later they had some things that were jointly written and they started dishing out too.

196
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,800
 I feel slightly guilty of this because I think Plochton may have been the first time they, they gave out three.

197
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:52,760
 But at the point where Plochton won the Hugo, we were actually an editor, a collaboration of nine people.

198
00:18:52,760 --> 00:19:04,920
 And I do think, but it was clear that the people who drove the existence of the fanzine had generated all of, all of the work that we done there.

199
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:13,240
 Although we had a lot of people working for it, it was primarily the three editors and that, and we are the ones who went up on stage and got to the rocket.

200
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,800
 That doesn't in any way diminish the contribution that the other people involved made to the fanzine, which was very large.

201
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:28,760
 And I feel like I don't really believe in this is a large team of a vast number of people, all of whom have equal weight.

202
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,360
 I think that they're normally one or two or maybe three people who drive a project.

203
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:45,920
 And we should be able to, we should be able to actually not have a thing where we go, oh, we're going to read out a list of 45 names for this nominee because they've decided that they're all of equal weight.

204
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:58,480
 So I'm kind of, I feel that it should have done a much better job of because obviously announcing the policy by fiat and not giving the community a chance to talk about what, whether we actually have a collective understanding of what it should be.

205
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,920
 Was not a very good way to go about it, but I think that you have a point.

206
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,960
 I would like to see, I would like to see that point discuss some subtly, which it may never be now.

207
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:21,920
 So I would say I can see that you might need to draw a line somewhere. I think if you have, I think if you had 50 names, then that is a lot to read out and a lot to have on the screen and a lot of people to potentially be rewarded.

208
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:30,680
 But I think the kind of way of saying, well, you'll all be listed in the book, but then when it gets sexual ceremony and the ballot that I'll be for of you is setting it way too low.

209
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:45,840
 And so one of my, one of my thoughts about this is I actually went back and looked at previous years to see how many people were listed. And I know this is imperfect because we know, we know informally that there's been a limit on this in the past and Chris Garcia has talked about this for journey planet.

210
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:56,520
 There are more teams being listed who would cross that four person barrier, but it's actually not entirely, I thought it would almost entirely be in sort of semi-proseen and maybe fanzine.

211
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:08,280
 But actually it catches some other categories as well because it catches the podcast that were in best related work when it was writing excuses, but it also catches some sort of things like comics which have five listed creators.

212
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:17,200
 And if you have the writer of a comic, a penciling team, an incur and a colorist, and that adds up to five people, which ones you knock off to get you down to four.

213
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,480
 And similarly with things like we say we don't list everyone for TV and movies, but actually we tend to list all the writers and the directors.

214
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,280
 And so for instance, when they listed Captain America the Winter Soldier, that has officially three writers and two directors.

215
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,720
 So you end up catching things that I'm not sure they're intending to catch by setting off at four.

216
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:43,280
 I would be quite happy for them to say actually we're going to set your cut off at 12 or you're going to set the cut off at 20 and see how we go.

217
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:54,840
 I don't really see the problem in listing people's names and we can see that even if you are in name a finalist and you're sat in the audience, but then the big sort of PowerPoint screen comes up and it only lifts up.

218
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,880
 It's for people from your project and not you.

219
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,680
 And then your project wins and you can't go up and take part in that and celebrate that.

220
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:11,680
 Then it just seems sort of a change where I can kind of see the arguments behind making it, but I'm not sure it really gains them more than they are losing.

221
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:24,480
 I think something that I would say, which is Alison mentioned, you know, movies have like large number of people and like books kind of have more than more than just the author.

222
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,200
 Contributing and I think that's true.

223
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:37,000
 And I think, but I think that the key here is to recognize the people who have the editorial on maybe not many editorials.

224
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,320
 The wrong word, but people who have the creative control.

225
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:52,880
 And I think the problem is that like in a movie, it's very clear that like the director and maybe like if a producer is very, very active, then they have the creative control over that project.

226
00:22:53,080 --> 00:23:10,600
 And like in a book, I think I would, I think I would argue that it is the editor and the author that have creative control and people who've listened to the podcast in the past will know that I have been kind of wondering for a while now why editors aren't recognized when fiction is awarded to you goes.

227
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:23,040
 But I think for projects like, for instance, on Canney magazine or for projects like like Joni Planet, I think that one of the things that we are seeing is that these projects are not only in the world.

228
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,960
 Are resulting in larger teams of people who have overall creative control.

229
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:41,160
 So like in the case of Joni Planet, like Chris and James, kind of contact guest editors who they want to do the work, but it is project that is made by many different editors.

230
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:48,880
 And I think without those editors exercising their creative control, the project would be very different.

231
00:23:49,080 --> 00:24:00,480
 And so I think even if you peg it as, you know, reward the people who did have that control and who helped shape the creative output of the nominated work, that number is getting bigger.

232
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,040
 And that might, it might not be that that's because of kind of technological advances.

233
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,240
 It might just be that like people are getting more inclusive in the community.

234
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,400
 And this is a way to bring marginalized people in and to uplift them.

235
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,640
 If you're a kind of white creator who has a platform, you can bring marginalized people and kind of give them creative control.

236
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,240
 And in doing that, you're uplifting marginalized groups in a way that's really positive.

237
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,200
 And so maybe that's why it's happening.

238
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,400
 But I do think that you can see the disease happening.

239
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:41,160
 And I think ultimately like, you know, I'm not saying that all of the people who do any work on a movie like that you see at the end of the credits should win a Hugo if the movie wins.

240
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:52,800
 Like because that would clearly be silly, but I think that it is different to then say, well, I look at the list of six people on the uncanny magazine profile who usually win rockets.

241
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,400
 And it's the editors in chief.

242
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,760
 It's the managing editor, the nonfiction editor and the two people who produced the podcast.

243
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,600
 And it's like, that seems fine.

244
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:07,680
 And arbitrary, really saying, well, the podcast doesn't deserve recognition or or the nonfiction editing doesn't serve recognition.

245
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:16,600
 I find it, I find it unconvincing that any of those six people do not have some level of meaningful,

246
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,440
 creative control over that project that is part of the reason why it wins the award.

247
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,560
 I think it would be interesting to have a discussion about the policy and the community and not merely about the flounce.

248
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:37,840
 But I feel like we should go on to talk about the fallout, which is perhaps more interesting because even if this was a good policy, which I think we've said,

249
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:49,120
 four, four seems like a rather arbitrary number announcing things by just kind of announcing them as a done deal seems slightly odd,

250
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,320
 especially when it's anything to do with the hugos.

251
00:25:51,320 --> 00:26:03,520
 But also it seems to be clear from what we do know about the fallout that the policy was implemented by the board over the objections of the Wussfuss division.

252
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,000
 And that does seem to be a very strange way to have gone about it.

253
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,120
 So having essentially announced a policy which went down very badly and have basically

254
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:28,800
 apologized and reverse course within 24 hours, everything was calm for a few days, then there was an announcement on the Disconsory Twitter that their co-chair collect for Zard would be resigning.

255
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:49,720
 And she then posted a statement on file 770 about her resignation, which essentially says that the feedback they got about this policy was the last straw in a number of last straws of how she feels the volunteers and the people who work on Worldcon have been treated over the years.

256
00:26:49,920 --> 00:27:05,280
 So she decided this was a good time for her to resign, post on file 770 about how the internet had been mean over and over to Worldcon staff and then to do a sort of mic drop and leave.

257
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,200
 And obviously Mike was very unhappy.

258
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,360
 This is what is known traditionally in fandom as a flounce.

259
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:27,600
 I like to collect a lot and I was very glad to get to know her as part of, because she was looking on Disconsory and she was supporting the bid when it was a bid and she seems like a really, really nice person who is fun tag out with.

260
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:40,320
 She mentioned a number of examples in her letter of ways in which she'd been mistreated and quite a lot of people who were not necessarily of the belligerent kind.

261
00:27:40,520 --> 00:28:02,520
 But we know other thoughtful experienced con runners came back and said, we don't necessarily think these are good examples of mistreatment that the yes decisions were criticized in those cases, but they, and sometimes they were criticized robustly but that they weren't done in a way that was aggressive or personal.

262
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:19,320
 This doesn't entirely add up and I think that seems right to me and I think it's possible because if you're sharing a convention or a big convention, people do criticize things about that convention for all sorts of reasons.

263
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:38,520
 Some of them are valid criticisms and some of them are mixed and some of them are not that valid but as the chair, it's very easy to start thinking of the convention as if it was your baby or in an analogy that will make sense to more people who listen to the podcast, your cat.

264
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:55,720
 And so you can become very defensive about criticism and start to feel that all robust criticism is abuse and that's not true.

265
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:07,720
 Now I don't, I haven't got back through all of the details and people do, I think when people are criticizing, they probably need to be less in temperant than they often are.

266
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:24,920
 There's all the stuff you learn in management training about delivering feedback with wrapped in, wrapped in good and secure thoughts about how wonderful the person or the organization you're giving feedback to is but there's this one little thing that they might like to change.

267
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:32,920
 This probably applies to conventions as well and I think people don't necessarily do that when they're tweeting out so it does upset people.

268
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:57,520
 But I feel like Koletta's overreacted, well she made a lot of overreacted by residing because I don't know what was personally going on but I think in making that statement, it seems to be to be a rather poorly thought through statement that has exposed, exposes rather more of her personal reaction to criticism than it maybe should have done.

269
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,120
 So that too.

270
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:05,320
 So I have, I have thoughts about this which is that I think it is silly.

271
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,120
 I think emotions are silly.

272
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,920
 No, that's not what I was like leap, leap, leap, leap.

273
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,920
 We're science fiction, we're science fiction fans.

274
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920
 We don't do emotions, didn't you know?

275
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,520
 Yes, that's right.

276
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:19,720
 Okay.

277
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
 And so yes, good.

278
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
 Now, good.

279
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:29,120
 See, I think there is a perception that I think, I think there is a real undercurrent in.

280
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:47,120
 A lot of these conversations and I think this is not just science fiction fandom, but I think in a lot of discussions like this, it is, is kind of maybe not unacceptable, but like it is not considered the done thing to say stuff like I hear your counter argument.

281
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:57,120
 And I see that you have a point, but the way you're expressing that point makes my feelings hurt and I would quite like you to go away for a little bit so that I am no longer hurt.

282
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:18,320
 And I think something I have been trying in my personal life to do more recently is when I get into discussions that are hurting my feelings, even if I'm sure that everyone involved isn't intending to do that, I sort of say, well, no, I mean, I sort of say, like, well, this is the way we're having this conversation kind of means that I feel hurt or defensive or I'm in a bad kind of place emotionally.

283
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:29,520
 And I'm sure you're not trying to do that, but maybe we should both take a step back and think, well, this discussion is a little bit hotter or a little bit more charged than it needs to be.

284
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:36,520
 And maybe there's a way we can have this discussion without kind of without having it in a way that could result in hurt feelings.

285
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,520
 And I think that is a very difficult thing to do because I think it opens you up.

286
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:48,720
 It makes you vulnerable to the person you're talking with and it's something that is, I find it very difficult to do with people I've known for decades.

287
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,720
 So doing with people I don't know who are on Twitter, I expect is impossible.

288
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,720
 And the rest of Twitter is not going to help you with that.

289
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:05,720
 Well, and so the thing with Twitter is Twitter is a fantastic tool and Twitter really rewards brevity.

290
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:14,920
 I like that the nature of the website is that you are rewarded by being able to encapsulate your thoughts very tersely.

291
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:21,920
 And I think that can be really valuable, but I do think it does mean that people tend to be very direct on Twitter.

292
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:35,520
 And I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but I do think if you're very direct with criticism, it can be easy not to couch that criticism in a way that kind of recognizes the fact that criticism can be hurtful.

293
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,720
 Even if that criticism is 100% valid and I agree with the criticism, I am, as you probably gathered,

294
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,720
 listed as from the previous segment of this podcast, I in general oppose DC's decision here.

295
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,320
 And I was generally on the side of the people who were complaining.

296
00:32:51,320 --> 00:33:00,720
 And I read Collette's statement and I do sort of think, you know, clearly, I think she is personally invested in a convention she was running, which I think I understand.

297
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
 And I don't think that's unreasonable at all.

298
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,920
 And I think clearly she has been hurt and I can see why.

299
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,320
 And I think and are not saying that that's unreasonable.

300
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,320
 I'm also not saying the people who criticized were being unreasonable.

301
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:20,120
 What I do think at a fundamental level is this is why the chair should not be the person who is reading this.

302
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,120
 The chair should not be the person who is responding to this.

303
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:31,320
 The chair should be displaced from this criticism by people whose job it is to encapsulate the criticism,

304
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,520
 report it to the chair in a way that is not quite as direct or to us as it is on Twitter.

305
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,920
 And then maybe the chair says, well, here is what I think and the people on the social media kind of layer say,

306
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,120
 aha, the chair respectfully disagrees and here is our response.

307
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:53,320
 And I think a very good example of this is Elon Musk, who on no account should be allowed to have his own Twitter account because the fact that he goes on flame wars against people all the time is like, no, get to media manager.

308
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:59,120
 I just want to say I completely disagree with that for in big and small ways.

309
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,720
 So Liz.

310
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:15,320
 So I would say one of the biggest things I have actually learned from working on World Cons is how to take criticism much less personally because I think that is the only way to work on a World Cons.

311
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:29,720
 You have to take pride in your successes and pride in things that go right, but you cannot take everyone saying, hey, you've done this in a way that is bad or you know, you haven't thought about the effect this has on particular communities.

312
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,800
 You have to not take that as a personal thing.

313
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,320
 It's not personally against you.

314
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,520
 It's saying, you know, this thing you have done in your role on this convention is not working for us.

315
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,920
 So I think that was one of the biggest things I have learned from having fairly public facing roles to World Cons.

316
00:34:45,120 --> 00:35:01,120
 And I think the second thing that goes along with that is Alison's way of saying, well, you've got to do it in management speak and maybe you can couch your criticism, you know, with some positive things is I don't think World Cons is in a position where people want to give us the benefit of the doubt to do that.

317
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:10,520
 And it's probably a longer discussion of how this announcement from DiscCon has to be put in the perspective and the context of all the other announcements from World Cons.

318
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,720
 But last year's Hugo's, the Hugo ceremony went very badly in prominent ways.

319
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,920
 So they're not people who we can say, look, this is our first misstep.

320
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,120
 Please give us the benefit of the doubt on this one and we'll discuss it more.

321
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:30,120
 These are people saying, look, last year you made a token cock up of it and we did not feel honored as finalists.

322
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,520
 And this year you're proposing to do this other thing which makes us feel not honored as finalists.

323
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,920
 So I can kind of understand why they got a bit angry.

324
00:35:37,120 --> 00:36:01,120
 And my third thing I will say in this round is that if you think that like the speed and immediacy of Trisha criticism is a problem for discussion and debate, then definitely I think the speed with which you can resign right along post by a resignation and posted on file 770 is another example of where the speed of the internet is really not helping.

325
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:08,120
 I think this post should have someone else on Facebook gone in a draw for a week and then you think about it again.

326
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:14,320
 And that's why I try to say with the layer between the chair and the criticism because I think that does cut both ways.

327
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,920
 I think you're completely wrong about insulating power from criticism.

328
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:31,120
 I think the fact that this happens is what leads to people being very bad at being chairs.

329
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:37,320
 The job of the chair over beyond anything else is to keep an overview.

330
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:50,920
 This is going to be awful management speak again, but you want him to keep an overview of everything that is going on at a high level, but also be sufficiently aware of what is going on at detail levels that you can make sure that policy decisions

331
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:58,920
 do reflect the entire community, do reflect, build a consensus, do all of those things.

332
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,920
 I mean, I think obviously Elon Musk should have a media manager.

333
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,520
 That goes without saying, but your chair does need to be aware of the criticism.

334
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:18,320
 However, as Liz said, I mean, I think if you've worked, I don't know, Liz worked with me on FollyCon and then we did have,

335
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:33,320
 the punctuation was a flat collective, but in general, if I'm kind of doing things in difficult circumstances as a chair, I'll write what I want to say and then I'll fizz it to people that I trust to say, is this setting the right tone?

336
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,920
 Is this taking us in a supportive direction?

337
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,520
 Because I know that I am somebody who is inclined to shoot from the hip.

338
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,720
 No.

339
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,920
 One of the roles that chairs often take at conventions is being the final arbiter of the Code of Conduct.

340
00:37:50,920 --> 00:38:04,520
 And whenever I run a convention, I take myself out of the Code of Conduct management line because I know this is something that I'm not very good at because I am not measured enough to do that job well.

341
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,920
 And also because I know that I have people who I could go to and say, will you do this for me and they will do it very well.

342
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:24,520
 So, and I feel like that's kind of, if you're the chair, you have to be prepared to take all the criticism and deal with it in a way that is productive.

343
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,720
 I don't think you could say, I have a media manager to manage all of that. I never look at Twitter.

344
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:37,720
 So I think you're right and I think, yes, I didn't necessarily mean to imply that the chair should be insulated from the criticism.

345
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:52,920
 I guess what I'm more meant was, I think I can see that there are modes of criticism that might be hurtful and like, I think I have two reactions to that, which is firstly, yes, I agree that the chair needs to be aware of all the criticism.

346
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,320
 And I think ultimately the chair's job in some ways is to be the person who is criticized.

347
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:08,520
 Ultimately, the conventions actions are at the final kind of in the final case, the responsibility of the chair.

348
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,320
 And if something goes badly, it is on the chair.

349
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:20,920
 I would say that the thing I was intending to say with that kind of insulating layer was not necessarily that the chair should be insulated from criticism in terms of like, you should never see any.

350
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:29,120
 But I think like this kind of thing where you've got kind of collect writing a statement in file 70, 70, which is quite incendiary.

351
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,320
 That's the sort of thing that I think having some sort of insulating layer would prevent.

352
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:50,520
 And the thing that you mentioned, Alison, of kind of making sure that you, because it sounds like you're describing an insulating layer, but you're kind of bouncing messages off people to make sure that there is some level of kind of double glazing in between the thing you want to say in your head.

353
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,920
 And the thing that people see you say publicly.

354
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:00,120
 Resignation letters are a classic, a classic form of saying something in sensory.

355
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,520
 That's OK.

356
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,320
 What I'm not suggesting that collection not have said something in sensory.

357
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,920
 That's her personal choice.

358
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:17,320
 I'm saying that if she had been a bit more reflective, she could have said something much more potent and not necessarily.

359
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,320
 It's basically people could look at what she said and go.

360
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,800
 She should not have said that.

361
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,040
 Whereas she could have definitely said that in a way that people went, oh, you know, she's got a point.

362
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,520
 We need to address things in both ways.

363
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:37,120
 I think I think I think in general, I am suggesting that the thing that got published in Fast Ever's ever, he was not necessarily constructive.

364
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:50,320
 I want to say one tiny thing before giving Liz her turn, which is a very wise manager once said to me that you should never write an e a sentence in an email or in in or in any.

365
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:57,920
 Published document where you could where you could append the words you idiot to the end of the sentence without changing its meaning.

366
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,920
 And and collect finishes her statement with keep.

367
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,320
 You'll have to keep this.

368
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:13,320
 Keep around and we'll find out which I think is is is a giant example of that exact point.

369
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:30,520
 So the other thing that we like to attention to is a long comment posted on for the post of file 7 17, which is from Jared Dashoff, who was the WISFIS division head for discount three and has now resigned.

370
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:49,720
 And it's essentially a comment that says that the policies that were put forward for the Hugo Award were not his idea or of his Hugo admins, but they did roll through and help to plan how to implement them and how to roll them out.

371
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,720
 And then they saw the response.

372
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,720
 They hadn't realized how much displeasure there would be and he and his Hugo administrator.

373
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:10,920
 I argue they should reverse course and which as we know they eventually did, but apparently there was a meeting where Jared Sugo admin was asked to resign.

374
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,920
 And as a result of this, he says that he has resigned.

375
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,920
 It's not clear who else is a giant, but there may be other resignations from his division.

376
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:36,120
 But essentially it's kind of disagreeing with Colette's point and saying essentially this was a policy that was not imposing them, but was not their idea and they came up with how to implement it and roll it out, which is what sometimes is going to happen.

377
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:44,120
 But then it seemed like the Hugo admin was the person who was going to have to take the fallout for this policy, which I would disagree with entirely.

378
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:53,320
 And it sounds like he disagreed with it to the point where he felt he had to resign. So I feel that also puts a very different slant on Colette's post.

379
00:42:53,320 --> 00:43:03,320
 And I think the messages I would take from this is that like all conventions, there is some internal disagreement.

380
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,320
 There is internal debate on things.

381
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:13,320
 Sometimes you will have to implement a policy which may not be what you would do ideally in a vacuum, but it may be kind of imposed on you because of the constraints of other divisions or because of the other divisions.

382
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,520
 Or because this is what the chair and the rest of the committee wants to happen or maybe just the chairs.

383
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:29,520
 But I do think that what this show is a policy that was rolled out from the top downwards when like when it was received much more disfavorably than they thought.

384
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:42,520
 And the book didn't roll back upwards to the top, but it rolled back upwards to kind of the Hugo admin, which really does not seem at the right level to say, okay, this is the person who needs to take the fallout for it.

385
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:55,720
 And what it looks like this has led to is probably maybe the loss of the Hugo admin, but the loss of the Wisphist division head and quite possibly the maybe other members of the vision I suspect who are also not happy.

386
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:04,720
 I think I have seen, we have seen resignation statements from other people within the Wisphist division of Discon.

387
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,720
 So I mean, I don't know how much of the Wisphist division will remain when the dust settles.

388
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:25,920
 I think, I think, and I know, and I think like whatever else I think about the policy and whatever else I think about the way Discon communicated the policy and whatever else I think about the way Discon climbed down off the policy and whatever else I think about

389
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:45,120
 Let's post resigning. I think this message from Jared makes it abundantly clear that at some level, this was not a good set of decisions made by the Discon chair under duress from criticism from the community.

390
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,320
 I'm assuming that the decision on the policy was taken by the board.

391
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,320
 But the chair signs off, as I said, it is on the chair.

392
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,320
 Yeah.

393
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:09,320
 And especially if the chair is going to kick off this giant argument, it is definitely on the chair because she would have known that this was not the idea of anyone else in her organization.

394
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:18,520
 It sounds very much like she attempted to shift the blame onto someone else to avoid taking the responsibility for this decision.

395
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:28,520
 And ultimately, if she had come out and said, "I instituted this policy," the Wisphist division implemented it, but it was me and the board that kind of decided it needed to be implemented.

396
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,520
 We sincerely apologize and we will kind of work on this going forward.

397
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,520
 I would not want her to resign.

398
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,720
 Collect through a very large amount of shade in multiple directions in her statement.

399
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:47,320
 And I'd say that Jared's response is clear and measured and not excessive.

400
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:53,120
 But they are doing that un-British thing of airing one's dirty laundry in public.

401
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,120
 Jared's response is, I think, a very good response.

402
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,720
 It clearly goes into like, "This is what actually happened."

403
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,720
 And I'm reading it.

404
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,920
 Obviously, I don't know for sure I wasn't there, but it doesn't seem like it would be an unlikely set of events.

405
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,520
 And he doesn't know to like, part of the reason he resigns is because he wasn't having fun anymore.

406
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,920
 He didn't feel supported by the organization.

407
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,320
 I think for Zard saying like, "Oh, this is because people are overly critical and the way we like,

408
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,120
 criticize our convention running is unacceptable, is all very well."

409
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:33,920
 Then when you find out that her own division heads think that she has kind of sold them down the river for magic beams

410
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,120
 and is a large part of why this has been so spectacularly mishandled,

411
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,520
 it's then very difficult to say, "Well, okay, she has a good point about how we have this discourse."

412
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,320
 I think it undermines her point that if she had handled it better as chair,

413
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,520
 then resigned and then been upset with the criticism.

414
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,320
 I'd be like, "Oh, you know, maybe we should have a discussion about this."

415
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:59,120
 I'm not sure if we have time to do it today, but I did a job for a Worldcon.

416
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:06,920
 I did a large job for the 2014 Worldcon and I concluded at the end of that that I did not want to do that again.

417
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,920
 And one of the problems that we have with Worldcons is that for whatever reason,

418
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:26,120
 we often find ourselves with the very large conventions, the very big jobs being done by people who may not either,

419
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:35,320
 they're either not very well suited to doing those jobs or they don't have a sufficient support network around them

420
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,120
 to keep them doing them properly.

421
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:44,720
 Worldcon is very difficult and when they say, "Friends don't let friends run Worldcons, this is why."

422
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:52,320
 But also that thing about back at the beginning, one of the things we did,

423
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,320
 points we did not make at the beginning that we maybe should have done is,

424
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,120
 the other question that comes to mind about this policy around the Hugos is,

425
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,720
 "Shouldn't this be a matter for Wussfuss or the Wussfuss business meeting?"

426
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,920
 It is relatively clear to me that the Hugo teams at previous Worldcons have been trying

427
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,520
 to keep some sort of lid on the number of people who are on the ballot for each finalist.

428
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,920
 It is relatively clear to me that there has been some pushback from the actual finalists.

429
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:29,120
 But that has all been happening in private email chains and what we're currently seeing is a kind of like an explosion of stuff coming out.

430
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,720
 Now that this argument is being had in a public sphere

431
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:40,320
 and I think that maybe it would be better to sort of have some kind of panel items at Worldcons

432
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,520
 and maybe some consultations and maybe some Wussfuss subcommittees

433
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,120
 and all of these things that do a very good job of go away and think about things

434
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:55,920
 and collect information and weigh up the pros and cons and then come back with a sort of coherent thing

435
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,120
 which says, "Here's what people think."

436
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,120
 You know, a policy document, for instance.

437
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,520
 The week before last we discussed the video game, Hugo, and there is this beautiful document

438
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,320
 "Beautiful is not necessarily the word I would use to describe this document."

439
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,520
 "Elegant, magnificent, marvellous."

440
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,720
 "Comprehensive is what I would say."

441
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,720
 "Comprehensive, comprehensive, good word."

442
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,920
 "Thorough, thorough is good."

443
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,720
 Yeah, but what I think it does do a good job is taking the potential arguments against the case

444
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,720
 and pretty forward the arguments against the arguments against.

445
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,120
 So kind of saying, "Here's why we think this would work.

446
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,120
 Here are some common arguments and here why we think they're not a problem."

447
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,320
 And I think, although I'm not saying that document is like my favourite argument,

448
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:43,920
 I do think that kind of approach to this kind of issue would probably be better

449
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,520
 than just sort of arguing in the 5.7.70 comments and on Twitter.

450
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:55,120
 And Alison did say, like, "Do you think we would have a measured and nuanced debate about this?"

451
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:01,920
 And I concede that it is possible that people would still find things to be annoyed and angry and chowty about.

452
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,720
 But I just, yeah, I think it might be better.

453
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:12,120
 Also, for the avoidance of doubt, I would rather hear the complete list of every name of somebody

454
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:18,120
 who worked on a large semi-prosean project than I would any more anecdotes by Robert Silverberg.

455
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:28,120
 I think actually it was a valid point that is kind of a later point I had said before about context,

456
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,520
 which is when people were pushing back against this policy on Twitter, it wasn't in a vacuum.

457
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,120
 These probably are the people who work on semi-prosean

458
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:40,320
 who have been having this back and forward with the committees trying to work out exactly who gets listed

459
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,320
 and who gets left out every year.

460
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,120
 And that's what you might not be able to see.

461
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,920
 So you just see them making a tweet against it, but you don't know they have spent several years

462
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,320
 pushing back against this and now they're just having this kind of imposed on them from higher up.

463
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,920
 So I think that's a useful point to make.

464
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,720
 And yes, I wholeheartedly with Alison, we don't need to mention that because that's obvious.

465
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:09,320
 I do worry that WISFAS subcommittees are where things go to die,

466
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,520
 but I do think that some guidelines on what is expected from this.

467
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,840
 For instance, I don't know if the Hugo base design guidelines specify like the size of the plaque

468
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,720
 that needs to be on the base, but if we are having problems fitting all the names on the base,

469
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,720
 then either we need to have a larger plaque on the base or we need to say to nominees,

470
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,320
 the base is this big.

471
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,720
 If we can't fit all your names on it, how would you like us to label your Hugo's?

472
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:41,520
 Yeah, I mean, I think somebody said you completely remove the emotional content of this by saying

473
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,720
 the plaque has room for X characters.

474
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,720
 It doesn't this doesn't necessarily work for Twitter mind.

475
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,000
 I can fit a lot in a tweet.

476
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,720
 If I could fit a tweet on a Hugo plaque, it would be pretty awesome.

477
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,120
 So would you be able to have Hugo plaque threads where like?

478
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,920
 You've got to win more than one year in a road, John, in order to properly thread.

479
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,920
 Yeah.

480
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,520
 Just keep reading every time.

481
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,520
 You could actually see a world in which you could print the whole of answer

482
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,720
 to its Hugo plaque.

483
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,720
 Excellent. I am in favor.

484
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,920
 Sorry.

485
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,920
 But no, I think I think we have I think we have discussed this and and yes,

486
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,920
 does anyone else have anything I'd like to add?

487
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,720
 I do think adding some frivolous bits at the end is probably not a bad idea because this is quite a weighty.

488
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,720
 It's quite weighty for us.

489
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,920
 Before we go, we're going to tell you about some upcoming events.

490
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:46,440
 So fanak, which stands for the Florida Association for Nucleation and Conventions,

491
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,640
 are hosting a interview.

492
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,800
 So John D.

493
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,440
 Berry, who gave a fantastic talk on punctuation at punctuation is interviewing Ted White,

494
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,880
 who is a fan who apparently needs interviewing.

495
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,000
 Yeah, he's phantoms equivalent of Robert Silverberg.

496
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,720
 They're hosting this at the 4 p.m.

497
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,240
 Eastern Standard Time on the 23rd of January 2021.

498
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,320
 It is a follow up to Rob Hansen's excellent tour of Spanish London,

499
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,840
 which Alison and I attended a few weeks ago and was magnificent.

500
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:28,720
 So if people are interested in that, go to fanak.org and poke around.

501
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:36,200
 Roman Orzansky, who is a locker of the podcast and a noted adladian fan,

502
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,320
 is involved with hosting a one day mini convention called Critical Mass.

503
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,480
 It is running noon to 8 p.m.

504
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:50,600
 Adelaide time and that is on the 31st of January 2021.

505
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,560
 The last panel of the day is about podcasting.

506
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,880
 I'm running at 7.30 p.m. Adelaide time, which is 9 a.m.

507
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,400
 British time and I will be appearing on that panel about podcasting.

508
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,160
 So yes, do if you don't get enough of listening to me on podcasts,

509
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,920
 feel free to come along to that and listen to me on a panel about podcasts.

510
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,760
 And then we're currently missing Arisha and I think

511
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,760
 Capricon is coming up on the 4th to the 7th of February and Boscone is coming up

512
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,280
 on the 12th to the 14th of February.

513
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,760
 So Liz and Alison, are you going to any of these events?

514
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,240
 I think I am going to Boscone.

515
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,400
 There will be a fan funds auction at Boscone.

516
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,320
 We haven't entirely worked out the format and plans for that, but it's going to happen.

517
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,400
 I was also going to trade, but I think I might have missed the deadline

518
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,360
 because it might have been Friday.

519
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,240
 But I'm not.

520
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,680
 I might get to Capricon as well.

521
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:58,080
 Jeremy Coxen, who I like very much is running is the chair of Capricon and she was

522
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,240
 encouraging me to go.

523
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,400
 And these are not very expensive.

524
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,600
 And I think Boscone is $25.

525
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,880
 And I think Capricon's $10.

526
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,240
 So they're not free events.

527
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,240
 I'm sure critical maths will be free or very cheap though.

528
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,080
 And Fanac is free.

529
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,320
 Yes.

530
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,440
 So yes, I'll definitely get to one or both of those conventions.

531
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,800
 I just haven't got my act together to look at how and where yet.

532
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:30,960
 But I do struggle slightly with American conventions because they

533
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,200
 start partying just at the point where I am thinking of going to sleep and I am

534
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,960
 quite a late stair-upper.

535
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,600
 The advantage of critical maths is if they do have an afterparty, then it will

536
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,440
 start at 10 o'clock in the morning, it sounds like, which is exactly the sort

537
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,960
 of time when I think about partying.

538
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,360
 So that's fine.

539
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,200
 That was the 23rd episode of the Oct Thought

540
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,840
 podcast and it's goodbye from me.

541
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,320
 It's goodbye from me.

542
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,560
 And it's goodbye from me.

543
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:25,120
 There are a lot of people whose only interest in an engagement with the World

544
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,760
 Con is the Hugo Awards.

545
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,520
 And they are coming along and saying, we care about the Hugos.

546
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,040
 We think the Hugos Awards are critically important.

547
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,560
 And so therefore, everything else you do.

548
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:43,120
 And this is evidenced by the fact that Hugos, that Wussfuss, is an entire division

549
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,000
 in the World Con organization, which if you think about the way that organisations

550
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,440
 are set up, it's quite strange.

551
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,160
 It's a very, it's because it is an enormous amount of work.

552
00:56:55,160 --> 00:57:00,600
 But and that's not even the half of it because the actual Hugo Awards ceremony

553
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:06,120
 are the two biggest parts of the events job, which is another division of the World

554
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,880
 Con. And so that's why I have put in the show notes.

555
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,880
 Maybe the Hugos just are a cankerous boil that should be excised from World

556
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,240
 Cons' fourth with so we could just have a nice convention.

557
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,920
 So my response to Alison would be, well, maybe the World Con is just a cankerous

558
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:32,400
 boil on the bottom of the Hugos and we may need an entire other podcast,

559
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,480
 I think, to do this justice.

560
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,240
 To say maybe should we just split these things into two entirely different things?

561
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,040
 So you could have the Hugo Awards along with the Hugo Awards weekend,

562
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,240
 like the Nebula Awards weekend, and that could be a largely professional

563
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:51,720
 industry body plus all the semi-prosy, sort of full of aspiring authors.

564
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,280
 And we could call the Hugo Awards weekend because it would involve lots

565
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,840
 of people convening from all about the world.

566
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,120
 And we could call that weekend con of the world.

567
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,760
 World Con. World Con. I got it.

568
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,760
 Hang on, hang on.

569
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,000
 I pause to say, Alison, I think this is a long topic that should have its own

570
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,920
 podcast and then you proceeded to start that podcast.

571
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,520
 I mean, I, in my defence, I just took the piss.

572
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,720
 We're just fine. We are, we are that kind of podcast.

573
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,120
 But no, I seriously think that we, if we are to do this justice and consider

574
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,160
 the pros and cons of whether we should do this, that we probably do need more

575
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:32,000
 than the time we have remaining unless our, you know, dear listeners,

576
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,320
 which just spent two hours listening to us, which are on about a single top.

577
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,080
 And no, that's fine.

578
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:40,480
 Let's push that away for a future for a future thing.

579
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:46,400
 Dear listeners, when Alison and Liz have their big discussion about

580
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,800
 splitting up the world call of the Hugos, please just imagine that I'm there

581
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,480
 shaking my head the whole time and that that will be enough input for me.

582
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,680
 You don't think he was a Mark protector?

583
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,320
 In practice, we cannot, we cannot split off the hugos.

584
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,560
 Alison, he's doing the podcast unless we really don't think there's enough for us

585
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,040
 to discuss this on a separate thing, but I think that there probably is.

586
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,600
 And so, in a case, yeah, no, 100% we've recorded, we've recorded enough podcast.

587
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,280
 Sorry, just in case that wasn't clear.

588
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,000
 We've definitely recorded a podcast.

589
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,160
 The theme music for this episode was

590
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,640
