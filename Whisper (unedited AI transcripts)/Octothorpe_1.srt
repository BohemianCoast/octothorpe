00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 Hello everyone, welcome to Octo Thought Episode 1, a new podcast brought to you by Boredom

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,600
 and Self-Isolation. I'm John Coxon, I'm a fan from the UK and I am joined byâ€¦

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,440
 Hi, I'm Alison Scott, I'm also a fan from the UK.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,080
 Hello, I'm Liz, I'm also a fan from the UK but I currently live in Thailand.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,640
 We decided to do a podcast about fandom from a British perspective and we're going to

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,320
 be talking about a few topics today in a kind of first episode stab at podcasting.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,040
 On the morning we record, it's the day after the EasterCon cancel, so EasterCon is the

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,680
 British National Science Fiction Convention and concentric 2020 was to be held in Birmingham

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,280
 this year but it has been cancelled as a result of COVID-19.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,960
 Now Alison was the fan guest of honour and I think all three of us are keen EasterCon

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,600
 fans. How are you guys reacting to the cancellation?

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,680
 Well, I am as they say gutted. I was obviously hugely looking forward to EasterCon anyway

13
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,760
 because it was the EasterCon and it's my favourite convention of the whole year but

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,760
 also because I was going to be fan guest and I was very much looking forward to that and

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,920
 I had a lot of ideas about fun things we could do and so now I guess we're going to spend

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,520
 our spring doing fun things indoors instead.

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,340
 And I'm also, I think, worried because it makes me wonder, will we have an EasterCon next

18
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,780
 year? Will we have more conventions? Is this it for the practice of travelling around the

19
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,600
 world and meeting our friends?

20
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,320
 So I've been assuming it was going to be cancelled for at least two or three weeks.

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,520
 We were just waiting on the final legal coverage so it could be cancelled without the committee

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:59,000
 being at a huge financial loss. I mean, I'm selfishly a little bit glad because I wasn't

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,720
 going to make it this year and I really wanted to go in the year that Alison was fan guest

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,320
 of honour because I think it would be hilarious and fun.

25
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,040
 May never happen again.

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,280
 I like hanging out with Alison because she's such a ray of sunshine. I'm assuming that

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,000
 there will be future EasterCons although of course I have something of a vested interest

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,600
 in global aviation that's still existing because I would at some point like to return

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,440
 to the UK and not live the rest of my life in Thailand.

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,200
 But that may be a deeper question than the cancellation of EasterCons, I feel.

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:43,520
 I think Alison's point about whether this will presage the changing of how we do travel

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,840
 and socialising is a really interesting question and probably would take longer than we have

33
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,280
 on this podcast to properly answer.

34
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,760
 But one of the things I have seen a lot in my professional capacity as someone who goes

35
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,480
 to science conferences is people discussing whether or not conferences are still a viable

36
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,360
 thing to do. But from my perspective, conventions are so much about the social aspect that I

37
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,080
 kind of feel like after all this has gone away again, we're going to be even more keen

38
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,760
 to go and see our friends because we're going to have missed out on that so long.

39
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,920
 So do you do you two think that this will be a portent of the end of conventions or do

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,120
 you think it's going to be a reason to continue conventioning with even more women vigor?

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,520
 I think I should clarify that when I said may never happen again, I was referring to

42
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,880
 my never being guest of honour again. But I promise to do everything like being guest

43
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,040
 of honour, staying up too late and drinking in the bar and meeting everyone at the East

44
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,320
 Con and all of that stuff anyway. I'm sure we're going to have more conventions. I'm

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,120
 certain of it. I think that everyone will be well ready for a convention once we're all

46
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,520
 vaccinated against this pandemic. And I'm sure there won't ever be another pandemic, isn't

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
 that right Liz?

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,800
 Oh yeah, absolutely. This is the only one. This is never going to happen again, viruses.

49
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:19,120
 Don't jump over from animals on a regular basis or anything like that. Is this the point

50
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,760
 where I inform our listeners that I work on tropical infectious diseases and so I might

51
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,880
 have a slightly skewed view on global pandemics?

52
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,960
 Yeah, I think of the three of us, you are the one that is most similar to an expert.

53
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,800
 So that's probably relevant information. I think because we've been having conversations

54
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,600
 about EasterCon up to the cancellation and I think most people assumed that it would

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,120
 eventually be cancelled once the government announced that mass gatherings and pubs and

56
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,520
 restaurants were no longer going to be allowed. It was just a question of when they would

57
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,360
 do that and therefore when the cancellation would come. I think to go back to your point

58
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,440
 earlier Liz, I was also expecting this to happen. I'm very relieved that the government

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,880
 has come out and taken steps that allow pubs and restaurants and places like that to close

60
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,360
 because I think until a couple of days ago that was something that was very difficult

61
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,120
 for a small business like that to countenance and obviously the Hilton being a small business.

62
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
 That's important.

63
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,880
 Yes, yes, I'm going to be definitely with the Hilton on this one.

64
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,400
 My sympathies rest with the committee and with the management of this hotel. It's clear

65
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,840
 that the hotel didn't feel they were in a position to cancel for some time and I'm

66
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,560
 not privileged to any particular information here. The committee did say, please don't

67
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,320
 talk about what might happen as if you were a member of the committee. So I think we could

68
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,880
 talk about what might happen with absolutely no knowledge whatsoever and making it completely

69
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,480
 clear we have nothing to do with the committee and I would like to see us spend part of our

70
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:11,800
 Easter weekend getting together, having some online discussion groups and Zoom chats and

71
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,920
 Zoom parties which are just like room parties except with social distancing.

72
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,960
 And with a pun, can't be a good pun. I think I agree with you, Alison. I would like to see

73
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,960
 British fandom kind of rally around on Easter weekend and put some online stuff on whether

74
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,360
 that's the convention committee or whether it's just a kind of a grassroots effort. I

75
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,920
 don't know because I haven't had a free Easter weekend since 2006 and I've forgotten how

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
 they work.

77
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
 They're boring.

78
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,640
 Yeah, exactly. I'm just, I'm not sure I'm going to appreciate a double bank holiday

79
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,400
 weekend in a time when I've not been allowed out of the house for three weeks. So do you

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,440
 think that will be something that gets organised as a grassroots thing or have you seen people

81
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,880
 start to talk about that?

82
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,600
 I've seen people on Twitter starting to discuss it but nothing concrete yet. I think it's

83
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,280
 also feeling that maybe we need to give the committee a few days to kind of process that

84
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,160
 yes, the convention is actually cancelled. All their effort is not going to result in

85
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,880
 an event and to decide whether they feel like they can redirect that into trying to do something

86
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,120
 online involving some of what they had planned for the actual event or whether they'd rather

87
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,840
 sort of hand it over to fandom and say, "Sorry, we cannot do anything in person this weekend

88
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,240
 but we give you our blessing to organise your own social gatherings online."

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,120
 I have one more thought about EasterCon which is that I'm very glad that in the great game

90
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,240
 of past the parcel that is running the EasterCon, the parcel didn't land when I was chair.

91
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,840
 So I have nothing but sympathy for this committee and what they're having to put up with now

92
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,080
 and deal with and I just, all my heart goes out to them really.

93
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:56,000
 I think that as a fandom we need to give the con-con space to do what they want to do if

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,120
 they still see the Easter weekend as something they want to head up and organise even in

95
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,720
 an online capacity that I am thrilled and I'll be super behind them. But if they are

96
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,360
 super crushed by the fact that all this has happened and they just want to go and kind

97
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,880
 of have some time, then I think that's another thing we have to be super supportive of like

98
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,360
 in either direction because I can't imagine how stressful the last month must have been

99
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,800
 for that convention committee, it must have been awful.

100
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,320
 Alison, as a former EasterCon chair, can you give us a little bit of an idea of what the

101
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,520
 EasterCon committee is financially on the hook for every year and the sort of risks

102
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,920
 that you take when you do commit to running one?

103
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,440
 I think that the primary problem here will be twofold. The first is that they will have

104
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:50,080
 given a commitment to the hotel that pending disasters of which this is clearly won, they

105
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,840
 will have taken a number of rooms in the hotel, quite a large number of rooms. And then the

106
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,600
 second thing is that they will have guaranteed a food and drink spend for the hotel. So you

107
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,440
 say not only we will bring in so ever many people to your hotel this weekend, but also

108
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,600
 they will eat and drink a lot of food and drink. And that's how you get the rate on

109
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,520
 the conference space is by promising to spend a very large amount of money on food and drink.

110
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,000
 That will have been considerably more than the cost of hiring space.

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,080
 The government mandating that restaurants and bars closed was the, I think, final straw.

112
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,960
 The impression I get from the convention announcement is that the hotel would have been unable to

113
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,720
 let people eat or drink in the hotel common areas. And so as soon as that happens, you

114
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,280
 have real trouble with your ability as a hotel to fulfill your contract from that, kind of

115
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:54,920
 holding a big event perspective. So I think that's why the cancellation happened now,

116
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,680
 because it was that that meant it became completely unworkable. I can't remember what

117
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:08,120
 the typical food and drink spend for an Easter con is, but I know it's usually five figures.

118
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,400
 I'd expect them to have a figure for a guarantee for food and drink in the high five figures.

119
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,080
 Which is a mad amount of money. So there's not...

120
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,480
 Have you seen how much beer costs? Yes. At five pounds of height, it doesn't take a lot.

121
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,440
 That's true. That's true. When I was an undergraduate, I used to complain about that very vocally.

122
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,040
 Strangely, now I earn more money. I've complained less. There's no seated Easter con for 2021.

123
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,680
 There's not an Easter con constitution. If we've got any US listeners who are used to

124
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,520
 Roberts rules of order and Wussfuss constitutions and all of these things, the Easter con is an

125
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,480
 anarchic collective of like-minded fans who sort of run conventions by gentlemen's agreement

126
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,360
 as much as by anything else. And so there's not any provision in any written document for

127
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,920
 what happens now. So how do we select the next Easter con and how does all that work?

128
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,880
 When you say that Easter con is run by a collective of like-minded fans, if enough former chairs of

129
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,880
 Easter con put their weight behind a proposal that comes forward, it will just be agreed by a claim.

130
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,280
 I just don't think there's a... I think this is much more of a problem in the minds of

131
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,320
 rules and urge than it is in practice. I also don't think people are going to be lining up to run

132
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,160
 the Easter con. You know, it would be a problem if you had a lot of contested bids.

133
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,200
 No, I think it's going to be very difficult,

134
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,440
 if whoever does step up and decide they want to run one next year, because they really won't be

135
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,120
 able to make any concrete plans for quite a while at this point. They can try and find a hotel,

136
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,680
 but they can't go and visit a hotel. They can't really make any commitments to guests or anything

137
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,960
 like that. I mean, I think you're probably looking at least the somewhere, if not early

138
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,960
 or before we even know if we'll be able to go and have an Easter con next year. So I think it's

139
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,880
 going to be a very difficult task. And frankly, if someone steps up to do it, then I will vote

140
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,280
 for them wholeheartedly. The most recent analogue is probably the 2007 Easter con,

141
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:21,240
 which was held in Chester after the Liverpool Easter con, folded. And that, I think, was a case where

142
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:28,280
 the convention was organized on about six months notice, if I recall correctly. I think convoy

143
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,320
 folded in the summer and the convention was in March 2007. And so it can be done. I don't know

144
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,360
 whether it will be the size of Easter con you would expect, because obviously Chester was very

145
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,800
 small for an Easter con. And it might be that if there's only a six-month lead-up, you do get a hit

146
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,400
 to attendance. But last time something even remotely similar to this happened, we still had an Easter

147
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,640
 con even if it was a much smaller one. So I'm hopeful that this is all resolved. And I think

148
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,000
 Alison's point is right that this is much more a problem in the minds of rules nerds than it is

149
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,200
 in real life. Because if enough people want their to be an Easter con, they'll be an Easter con

150
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:13,560
 regardless of any other considerations. I think that's true. I mean, I wonder how much of the 2020

151
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,400
 Easter con the committee might want to try and roll forward into 2021. Because presumably there's

152
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,760
 been a lot of planning done already. A lot of organization has been done. It's possible that

153
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,640
 some of it can just be sort of jumped forward a year if they wanted to go again for next year.

154
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:38,280
 But I would also understand if they really want to take a break. I think my question would be that

155
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,960
 we compare this to 2007, but it's not really the same situation as 2007, I think, because

156
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:50,440
 it's a completely different background. But question is, it seems like Easter con has rolled

157
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,520
 along as a sort of very loose collective gentlemen's agreement different from year to year for a long

158
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,480
 time. And possibly actually it's a ticking time bomb we have been passing along for a while and

159
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:08,600
 happens to explode in 2020. Do you think this will lead to a long term change in how we organize them?

160
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,120
 I think this is a great topic for another episode of Octas thought. Tune in next time

161
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,720
 when we talk about Withery's to go. I think that is a long discussion. And I think it's a good

162
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,960
 question. And I think we will come back to it in future episodes. And we would love our listeners

163
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,880
 to write in with their thoughts. So on the subject of Easter con being cancelled on the topic of the

164
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:38,840
 fan funds, Michael Larry, who is this year's TAFtelegger has cancelled his trip. Fortunately,

165
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,360
 TAF, which is the transatlantic fan fund, has enough money in the bank that it can run another

166
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,040
 trip next year. And this shouldn't be too much of a problem of speculative of the fund. But

167
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,080
 obviously the other fan funds such as the Down Under Fan Fund and the Going Under Fan Fund will

168
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:02,120
 be affected. And projects like Connel Bust, which gets people of color to conventions, may also be

169
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,960
 impacted due to have any thoughts about how this is going to affect that kind of thing.

170
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,880
 Fair full disclosure. I am one of this year's Gough candidate. So I am running to be the fan

171
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,800
 who goes from Europe to New Zealand for the New Zealand Worldcon. I think at this point,

172
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,080
 the New Zealand Worldcon must be in doubt. July time, I don't see how it's going to happen,

173
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,920
 but it might do. And I particularly wanted to run this year because it's the first year

174
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:38,200
 after my youngest child turned 18. So I can actually go off and party in New Zealand for

175
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,040
 and Australia for weeks on end without having family responsibilities. But I'd be very happy to

176
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,920
 run for Gough at some future date. The Gough has always found it harder to raise money than

177
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,560
 TAF has, just because the expense of a trip is very much greater. And the number of fans in

178
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,560
 Australia and New Zealand are slightly smaller. I think Gough this year, I think it's going to

179
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,840
 be cancelled because we won't be sure if there is a Worldcon in time for anyone to seriously plan.

180
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:15,560
 And also, I think the finances are so difficult, especially given that there are a lot of

181
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,880
 teams wanting to run for Gough this year, that it might be reckless to make any kind of concrete

182
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,000
 reservations that can't be cancelled for full refunds, because you might just sort of take out

183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,200
 all of the Gough reserves and then you won't be able to run again. I also think, speaking as someone,

184
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,600
 you know, in a country I live in which I am not a citizen of and where it's obviously becoming

185
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,000
 increasingly difficult to leave, I think people might be quite reluctant to go to New Zealand or

186
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,400
 Australia this year because at any point we might have more lockdowns and you might find that you

187
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,840
 can travel there but make it very difficult to travel back again. So for this year, I think

188
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:03,400
 it's a non-starter. In the future, I'd like to see it continue. It's a huge shame that we're going

189
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,280
 to miss having a race when there is a Worldcon, potentially in Australia and New Zealand,

190
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,160
 but hopefully it can continue in some form in future years.

191
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:21,480
 I do feel sorry for New Zealand 2020 because even if we completely eradicate the coronavirus

192
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,720
 before that convention goes ahead, I can't imagine this is going to do good things to their membership

193
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,200
 curve. And as the first Worldcon in New Zealand, I think that is a huge shame. And I think your

194
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,600
 point about Gough running to Australasia is another facet to that being a huge shame.

195
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:48,840
 But I think hopefully we can keep the fanist connections going online. So should we talk about

196
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,040
 consolation? Are both of you on the consolation Facebook group?

197
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,320
 So I am but I'm not really reading it. That's fair.

198
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,680
 Because I have a look and I don't know. I think I must have just been in completely the wrong

199
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,880
 frame of mind but I didn't find it very funny. It started off quite funny because it was all full

200
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,520
 of con runners and con runners that the group of people are on like journeymen of fandom which is

201
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,920
 the primary Facebook con running group have a certain mindset and they have a lot in common

202
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,000
 with each other even if the sorts of conventions they're running are very different.

203
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,080
 But now consolation is bloomed to about 20,000 people and a lot of those people

204
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:44,440
 aren't, they don't share the same context and experiences as say Easter con fans do.

205
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,840
 I mean there's a reason why we're saying this is a podcast from a British fan

206
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:55,240
 fanish point of view that we know that the people that we are speaking to are going to have much of

207
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,360
 the same interests and influences as we do. Consolation is now beyond that point.

208
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,560
 It's covering a lot of different fandoms not all of which are my fandom.

209
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,560
 I still find it's got some quite funny things in it from time to time.

210
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,080
 It's an incredibly difficult thing to balance when you get to 20,000 people you can't all share a

211
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:22,760
 sensibility and in a venue like well in a real convention where you can have different programming

212
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,000
 streams and different rooms and different corners of the bar that works fine because

213
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,160
 not everyone has to share a sensibility but a Facebook group with no separate channels and no

214
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:40,440
 kind of different corners can't replicate that. Although I will say the last few posts on that

215
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,400
 group from my perspective have been from British con runners so I have been appreciating those

216
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:52,440
 quite a lot but I don't know what the main oofra is. I mean it's at times like this I really miss

217
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,680
 live journal. I know live journal is still there but in terms of its fanish presence it hasn't been

218
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,520
 for years and years now but the communities and the different people's blogs were a very good

219
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,480
 way of emulating that kind of series of corners. Facebook just doesn't seem to do quite the same

220
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,000
 things. I think that's going to be a problem for ending attempts to kind of have fanish

221
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,880
 activity online while we can't have face-to-face conventions. Seems like Facebook is not really

222
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,840
 the best space for it just because you can't scale to that many people and also it's so hard to see

223
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,680
 what's new, what you've read, what you've already seen before but someone's posted lol again and

224
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:42,760
 so it's popped up to the back you know the top of your feed again. I think it was obviously a great

225
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,160
 thing to start at the time but I think it's going to be a useful lesson in how we do and don't run

226
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:54,040
 these things over the next six or twelve months while we can't have face-to-face meetings any

227
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:02,040
 time. I know a lot of fanish activity happens over on Twitter as well but I think Twitter falls

228
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,960
 into a lot of the same problems where if you if you follow mostly people in fandom you can

229
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,920
 replicate that kind of fanish experience but if you've got quite a very Twitter timeline it doesn't

230
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:19,640
 do a good job of clumping everything together into coherent structures as it were.

231
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:26,440
 I also I really value longer form writing and although you can do this on Facebook to some

232
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,280
 extent and you get quite good feedback don't get me wrong when you write in a longer form

233
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:40,360
 it's not the same as fanzines or even the the longer form writing on live journal and Twitter is

234
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:47,720
 really hopeless for this even though this whole I am now going to write a thread one of 48.

235
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,520
 I think a lot of the efforts to long form writing on Twitter are putting a plaster over

236
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:03,160
 some pretty big hurdles and I guess the size like Tumblr are not widely adopted enough.

237
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,840
 Well that's not true of of many fandoms but certainly the kind of Easter ongoing fandom has

238
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,040
 never coalesced around Tumblr in the same way it did around live journal and so I think

239
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,200
 I think you're right that the difficulty of doing long form discussions especially on Twitter but

240
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,640
 on Facebook as well is a real problem and I am wondering whether this will encourage fandom

241
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,000
 to discover better venues for that kind of interaction than we currently have but I don't

242
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 I don't know because I don't know what options there are and how easy those venues are to find.

243
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,760
 I would say that Tumblr also is quite difficult for this kind of interaction

244
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,080
 not because you can't post quite long post but the only way to really interact is to sort of

245
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,960
 repost it with your own comments on and then the discussion just forks into a million different

246
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,440
 pathways and you can never follow them all. I think it's a good broadcast medium but not a

247
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,680
 good conversational one so I think that the choice is going to be do we find a medium which is

248
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,800
 better suited to how we want to communicate or do we continue sort of lodging communication

249
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,800
 in the platforms that people are already on even though it doesn't work that well but I guess in

250
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,360
 the early days Twitter didn't even have @realise and hashtags people sort of came up with those

251
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,760
 on the fly and got them incorporated into the system so maybe someone will come up with a

252
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,040
 much better way of doing things on the platforms we already have. That is true and I should say

253
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,200
 there are many people who do use Facebook and Twitter to engage in an awful lot of fan activity

254
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,480
 and I suppose it's entirely possible we will get letters of comments from those people

255
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,200
 criticizing our take because I am aware that I'm on Twitter but I'm nowhere near as engaged as

256
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,320
 as some of the people on my timeline are and the same with Facebook. I think you Facebook a lot

257
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,600
 more than me Alison especially in terms of long form writing. I'm we're about to move on to how to

258
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,320
 keep sane during an apocalypse. I think I may have noticed we were going to have an apocalypse

259
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:08,200
 likely before average and I started doing a lot of things around self-care. I'm a very

260
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,560
 atheist person but I think spiritual self-care is incredibly important for people which is odd if

261
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:22,760
 you believe that we're all basically animals who will go into the dust so I've been doing a lot of

262
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:30,920
 meditating and a lot of journaling and a lot of that then becomes journaling on Facebook because

263
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,640
 I write things that I can then share to a public audience or a near public audience.

264
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:42,200
 Yeah because you've been trying to whittle away all of your earthly possessions or at the very least

265
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,200
 carefully examining what earthly possessions you need. Yeah that's just gone so wrong I've

266
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,520
 just bought a pair of Joy-Cons but that's that's staying sane in the apocalypse that seems entirely

267
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:01,480
 fair to me maybe this is why this does not work well for my personality type which is more things

268
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:09,160
 loved things. And I ask what Joy-Cons are because they sound quite like sex toy. Switch controllers.

269
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,320
 They are a sex toy they're the things that fit onto your switch two days ago Nintendo released

270
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:22,280
 Animal Crossing New Horizons which is the video game for our time you and your friends can build

271
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:31,800
 a lovely island paradise where you pick fruit go for long walks do not observe social

272
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,320
 distance and conventions I started to play it using my son's switch and I was like but this is

273
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,400
 hopeless and he said this is Joy-Con drift which is a thing apparently and I was like well

274
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,640
 your joysticks don't work and he was like no I need new ones but I can't afford 62.99 so.

275
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,480
 So to stay sane you have bought switch controllers and Liz you have purchased a PlayStation 4

276
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:02,760
 and acquired a much larger television. Yes I should say it was actually coincidental that my

277
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,560
 television which is in my rented flat and so I don't own it basically went tits up at the same

278
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,440
 time I bought a PlayStation and it got instantly replaced with one about twice the size.

279
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,920
 It was quite fortuitous really I think it's about 55 inches kind of my sex tape obviously.

280
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:25,960
 Family show Liz family show and that is what as mathematicians call exponential growth.

281
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:33,320
 No I look greatly in which my life where I spend most of it you know sitting in between the same

282
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,840
 four walls because I don't know the fact that people are almost people sized on it seems to

283
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,280
 make a huge difference. I hadn't thought of that but that is interesting if you buy a

284
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:51,080
 television large enough to have people sized people on it does that make you subconsciously feel

285
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:58,520
 less lonely I don't know. When my daughter started at university we got into the habit of just

286
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,640
 leaving Skype video on for hours on end and I thought about the future this is back when I

287
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,720
 thought that the future would be good and I assumed we'd all have essentially video walls and you just

288
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,320
 set up permanent video links to all of the people that you care about on your video.

289
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,200
 I should say we have been in lockdown for about 24 hours here so I'm not quite as

290
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,400
 starved as human contact as I will be in 12 weeks time.

291
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:32,280
 That's fair my work advised us to work from home from and they just gone so I'm at the end of my

292
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,880
 first week of lockdown and I don't know how long you've been

293
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,520
 locked down for Alison at the moment. I've been working from home for about four years

294
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:50,280
 but my family are also working from home and my house turns out to be quite small

295
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,720
 if everyone's trying to work from home and it wants that's a real problem for us so my

296
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,760
 my week has been having much about home much more if you can contact them normal.

297
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,680
 We're still also walking out every day at the moment we can go to parks we can go

298
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:10,920
 anywhere but that's I think isn't that by next Friday that will have stopped I'm sure.

299
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:17,320
 I stopped doing main social interaction from Wednesday last week because it was obvious that

300
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,440
 it was going to be necessary. Yeah that's fair. This is very depressing John we need less depressing

301
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,600
 death stuff in our podcast and more jokes. That's fair that works. Lots of people are putting

302
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:35,800
 entertainment online. Yes yes. So lots of games are free. The metropolitan opera and the royal opera

303
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:43,640
 house have an opera every night. You can go and stream there's loads of television. I'm already

304
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,760
 in television bankruptcy so Disney+ launches in two days time in the UK. It's a lot large in two

305
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,960
 days time for the Asia region. I'm very grumpy about that. How long do you have to wait?

306
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,440
 We don't have a firm day. I think they said spring 2021 or maybe it was pulled forward to autumn 2020.

307
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,400
 Maybe they will pull it forward now all the theme parks are closed and no one's going to

308
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,920
 the cinema because that will get them more cash but it will have to wait and see.

309
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,600
 All of the streaming services are reducing bandwidth so they're reducing quality on the service

310
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:25,800
 which seems fine to me. Because you're about to have a huge uptick in the amount of streaming so that

311
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,200
 I think makes a lot of sense. I'm also a child of the video age. I remember VHS. I remember

312
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:39,560
 long play recording on VHS. I remember long play recording on VHS. It's not that ancient.

313
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,920
 Yeah so the quality was not that good but we coped right? We did cope but I also remember

314
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:51,960
 bit torrenting TV in the smallest possible files. Actually not bit torrent. Probably before bit torrent.

315
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,440
 Downloading TV in the smallest possible files so I can get away with them on my back.

316
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:06,440
 And you know we just live with it. Okay boomers. These people today. Obviously I have never

317
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:13,640
 bit torrented or downloaded anything. I have no idea at all what you're talking about obviously.

318
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,520
 This is a golden opportunity to catch up with all of the TV shows that I have been letting.

319
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:24,120
 Lacking. I am approaching the season three finale of Buffy which gives you an idea of how

320
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:32,600
 behind I am. And I've also been playing a lot of board games. A bunch of print and play board games

321
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:40,120
 have been made available for free online. I contributed to a GoFundMe for a gaming podcast I

322
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,440
 listened to who has some contributors who are struggling to stay afloat at the moment.

323
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:50,360
 And they've been giving free games to people who donate. And so I put a couple of links in the

324
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,480
 show notes to a couple of free games I've been thoroughly enjoying over the last few days.

325
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,960
 And I also spent most of this weekend playing the DLC for Horizon Zero Dawn on PS4 which I

326
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,120
 had no idea got around to and I am thoroughly enjoying. Have you started playing your PlayStation

327
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:15,240
 Atlas? I have. It came with a free copy of The Last of Us which obviously is a near future

328
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:22,680
 dystopia after a pandemic has taken hold. And then as a chain from that I got a game with no

329
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,960
 shooting involved. So I bought everybody's gone to the Rapture which is a game about wandering

330
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,960
 around a structure village in the 1980s after everyone has been raptured in some way after that

331
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,120
 and they've closed all the roads because they're saying it was a flu pandemic. So I picked really

332
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:44,280
 the worst possible games to start my PS4 gaming experience with. I've got to try something more

333
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:50,840
 jolly for next week. So obviously reading's also an option and I'm currently reading The Journal of

334
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:57,640
 the Plague Year by Daniel DeFoe which turns out to be very it has a lot of messages for our times.

335
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:05,320
 Is everyone buying toilet paper in Thailand? So not so far. I mean there were stacks and stacks of it

336
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,680
 when I went to shops today but also my supermarket has not been hit by shortages. Really the buying

337
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:16,600
 has just started because they've closed all the restaurants out of this weekend. But also I've

338
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:22,440
 got a B-day sprayer and every toilet in Thailand has a B-day sprayer. Are you aware of these?

339
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:29,160
 Do you want to describe them for the listeners who aren't? So the best description I've heard of

340
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:37,240
 these is that your toilet pees back. So it's not a B-day seat but basically it's just like

341
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,800
 a sort of showers break on on a hose with the idea being that you can like wash things up a bit

342
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:49,480
 and then usually like wipe and so on but in an emergency you'd probably be okay.

343
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,520
 So that may be behind the lack of panic buying of lural so far. I'll keep you updated on the

344
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:03,480
 lural status as we go along. Thank you very much. On the subject of books I am reading The

345
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:11,720
 Laundry Files by Charlie Stross. I am reading the most recent I think which takes place in a UK

346
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:20,520
 after the government has been supplanted by a literal elder one. So it's not quite as relevant

347
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:27,400
 as the reading material you two are reading but it's still not a barrel of laughs. I'm also not

348
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,640
 sure whether I'm going to be able to return it to the library anytime soon because it is now over to

349
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,560
 you. My library has automatically extended return dates till the end of April so you should check.

350
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:43,560
 Oh that's really good. From the library I have the audiobook of Hillary Mantell's The Mirror and

351
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:52,040
 The Light all 78 hours of it so that's keeping me busy and also from the library I have Europe

352
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,800
 in Autumn by Dave Hutchison which apparently there was a pandemic in that one as well but people

353
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,560
 have been recommending the Europe books to me for years so I'm quite pleased to finally be getting to

354
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,840
 read them. I have bought a book on the Great Flu pandemic of 1918 but I have not brought myself

355
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,200
 to start that one yet and maybe I shouldn't while I am home alone I might stick to more

356
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:21,640
 theory reading. I said I'm reading Bare Face Messiah which is the biography of Elrond Hubbard.

357
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:28,600
 Oh okay. Which I believe got its author followed about by Scientology for many many years.

358
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:35,720
 I have no opinions on Scientology while I'm on this podcast. I also have no opinions on Scientology

359
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:41,000
 and opinions on obviously bit torrenting. I just have strong feelings on B-day sprayers.

360
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,440
 I have just checked and my library has extended my book reservation. I can exclusively reveal

361
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,840
 I am reading The Labyrinth Index and yes I have until the 17th of June to read it now so they've

362
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:01,640
 extended that by three months. Hopefully that is pessimistic but we shall see. I am very lucky

363
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:08,360
 my local library does a very good genre selection. I was able to borrow some of the Hugo finalists

364
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:16,920
 last year. So just before we wrap up what would you say your one top tip for surviving the apocalypse

365
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,160
 is? I don't know yet honestly I think I need more time in isolation to develop those habits.

366
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,800
 I have started doing online YouTube workouts in which a cheery guy tells me you know to push it

367
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,400
 to the max and we're going to push through this and every workout is a step towards your goal

368
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,640
 and it turns out I quite like that at this point in time. At the moment my life is very much

369
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,400
 I think if you do live with other people spending time working out how you're going to

370
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,480
 share your space differently I think is going to be very key to staying sane and has been a very

371
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,560
 big part of our week. While I can I'm getting out every day because I'm fairly sure I will not be

372
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,880
 able to get out every day in another week or so I'm thinking of taking up gardening.

373
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:13,160
 What sort of world are we in where things like walks and gardening and jigsaw seem like sensible

374
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:21,320
 uses of anyone's time? My wife has in fact mostly been gardening and doing jigsaw puzzles both of

375
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:27,720
 which are activities she loves so she has been very happy. I do think the siloing of personal space

376
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,680
 and being very strict about that has helped me in a span near a lot over the last week.

377
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:39,160
 So that brings us to the end of the first episode of the Octa Thor podcast. Thank you very much

378
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:45,640
 for listening to episode one. I think the lifeblood of a podcast is the interaction with our listeners

379
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,360
 and obviously we don't actually have any listeners so if you're listening to this we really want

380
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:56,600
 you to know what you think of the podcast and what we should be doing better and what you think

381
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,520
 about the topics we've covered and what topics we ought to be covering next time.

382
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,480
 And you know get another ground floor before we become a big deal and we won't pay any attention

383
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,440
 to your feedback obviously now is the best time to send a selector. No cut there that's a line.

384
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,560
 Oh and if you're interested in sponsoring the podcast we have sponsorship spots right.

385
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:26,200
 Oh wow okay yeah so we're super keen to hear what people think what people think we

386
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,840
 can do better what people think about the topics we've covered what people think we're doing well.

387
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:37,720
 So please send us letters and clips of comment. That brings us to the end of episode one of the

388
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,760
 Octa Thor podcast. I'd like to thank my co-host Liz Matty and I as a Scott for joining me. If you'd

389
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:50,200
 like to send letters or clips of comment to us please email OctaThorpcast@gmail.com. If you'd like to

390
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:57,400
 tweet about us or use other social media then hashtag OctaThorpcast and we will see you in episode two.

391
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,720
 So for now it's bye from me and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.

392
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,480
 Nailed it.
