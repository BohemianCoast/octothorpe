1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
 Chengdu is a shower segment.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,560
 Leave yourself plenty of time to nominate.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,480
 Don't do it at the last minute because several people have reported Chengdu not actually finding

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,080
 their memberships or them not being sure what email they're registered or under and it's

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,200
 going to take them a while to sort out that sort of issue.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,720
 And although the nominating website is completely fine, it's not quite as you are used to, so

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,280
 it might take you a little bit longer.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,160
 So do not leave it till the very last minute.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:47,120
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 82nd episode of OctaThorp.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,520
 This episode is coming to you on the 27th of April 2023 and I'm John Coxon.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,240
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Ms Batty.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,520
 This episode is going to be an episode about the Hugo Awards given that the nomination

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,880
 deadline is coming up at the end of April.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,200
 So as this drops, you will have a few days to get your ducks in a row.

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,960
 So we're going to discuss what we're nominating for Hugo's that we haven't already discussed

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
 in episode 77.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,520
 And if you didn't listen to that, go back and listen to it.

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,560
 It was probably good.

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,000
 For load star, I'm nominating Netlombone by Tkingfisher.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 It's really good.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,800
 I am nominating The Golden Inklays, which is the final book of The Golden Inklays series,

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,320
 so that will end up on my ballot twice.

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,560
 And I'm also nominating Unraveler by Francis Harding, which just won the B.S.A.A.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,000
 Award for Younger Readers.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,360
 And it's basically another great Francis Harding book.

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,360
 And at this point, I'm just sort of like ranking within a bunch of excellent books as to which

27
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,200
 is my favourite Francis Harding novel.

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,520
 So yeah, I think you should go and read this one and nominate that one as well.

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,480
 I am also nominating Unraveler, which I liked less than a face like glass and more than

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,040
 the diving one.

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,040
 I thought this was pretty good, but I don't think I am disinclined to nominate it for

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,600
 novel because as so often with young adult fiction, I find I make allowances for the

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,720
 fact that it's young adult fiction and that parts of the plot feel to me to be incredibly

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,320
 transparent to an adult reader who is reading with the...

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,640
 I really, really liked the first half of the book and then I thought it kind of went and

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,280
 told a very ordinary story for the second half of the book, but I really, really liked

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 the first half.

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,000
 So, you know, definitely fine for Loadstar where I'm not expecting novels to do quite

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 so much.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,720
 We're going to very quickly talk about what we're nominating in the fan categories.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,200
 So I'll be nominating Hugo Girl, who is an excellent fan cast and who gave us a very

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,080
 nice shout out when they were talking about Hugo nominated things.

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
 So yes, go listen to them, go nominate them, they are great.

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
 We love you, Hugo Girl.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
 Yay!

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
 Transatlantic besties.

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
 Transatlantic besties.

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,440
 I am going to be nominating the Fanax series of fan history zooms.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
 I went to one of these yesterday.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,960
 It was very good as a day they all are and they're all on YouTube, which is why they're

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,520
 eligible for best fan cast because as we know, booktube, which this isn't, is a fan

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
 cast thing.

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,640
 They're very, very good and I recommend you check them out and we'll have a link in the

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
 show notes.

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,000
 And last night, somebody said loudly, "I'm so glad to have something to nominate in this

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 category."

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,560
 And I was sitting there in the audience feeling very droopy at that point.

58
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,800
 Though I think quite a lot of people who liked the fan-lack fan history zooms do also like

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,840
 octothorps, so shout out to all of those people.

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,040
 And I will also be donating Ian Clark and Ispania Sheriff and Alison Scott for best fan

61
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
 artist.

62
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,720
 Thank you very much.

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,560
 And Sue Mason.

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,360
 So for an example of Ispania and Alison and Sue's fan art, you can check out the octorp

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,680
 cover art from last year and Ian hasn't done us any cover art and now I'm saying it out

66
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
 loud.

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
 That seems like something we should probably fix.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,360
 Yeah, no, I'm sure if we ask nicely, he'd do us one, don't you think?

69
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
 Right?

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,240
 Ian, if you're listening, we'll be in touch.

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
 Yes.

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,080
 Yeah, this will be embarrassing when he's not listening.

73
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:22,840
 So, yeah, I will also be nominating Sarah Felix in this category whose art I continue

74
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,440
 to like very much.

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,000
 And then it's on to Best Semi-Proseem.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,440
 Uncanny probably is going to be on that ballot.

77
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,800
 Strange Horizons, nominate Strange Horizons, they're great.

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
 Yeah, Strange Horizons ever won.

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
 Nope.

80
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,880
 They're good if they did at some point.

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,640
 Huge, huge sore point.

82
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
 Should they win?

83
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,200
 They've been close many times, is the thing.

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,280
 They're usually second, very rarely they're third.

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,720
 Yeah, Uncanny's very good though.

86
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
 Yeah.

87
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,640
 So I'll definitely nominate those two.

88
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,480
 So is Locust.

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
 And Fire.

90
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
 Fire.

91
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
 Yeah, very good.

92
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
 Yes.

93
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,080
 Fire are good.

94
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,560
 Then there's the Best Editor categories and no one ever knows what's nominating those

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
 because no one understands what they're for.

96
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,440
 So then it's the Dramatic Presentation categories.

97
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,800
 Let's talk about Best Dramatic Presentation a long form.

98
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,680
 I think I've probably seen the most off this list, so I think I should go last.

99
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,400
 I have seen very few, actually.

100
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,640
 I seem to have accidentally watched no films this year.

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,320
 Well, I mean, that's not true.

102
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,120
 I have not seen no films, but there are some notable omissions like I have not watched

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,880
 Black Panther or kind of forever, I have not watched The Batman because I have no intention

104
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,040
 of watching The Batman.

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
 It's too long.

106
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,840
 Oh yeah, don't be mean either.

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,280
 There's a bunch of potential nominees I have not seen and what I've seen mostly are

108
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,440
 the TV shows.

109
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,880
 And we need to some extent discuss those when we discussed BDP short form.

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,080
 But rather than go for the super obvious choice that everyone's going to pick, I am,

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,520
 in fact, going to pick Turning Red.

112
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
 I'd see that to me is a super obvious choice everyone's going to pick because that is

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
 a great movie.

114
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
 10 out of 10 movie.

115
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,600
 I mean, I think it is super obvious choice, but I do not think it is the number one choice.

116
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
 Is it?

117
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
 I rather liked it.

118
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,000
 I'm going to watch Turning Red in time for the nominations because I think that's such

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,200
 a great pick and I have not seen it.

120
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
 I've been meaning to see it for ages.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 It's very good.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,240
 So I really like it.

123
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,200
 The director directed Bow, which is a very cute Pixar short film, which I'm pretty sure

124
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,280
 made me cry in under five minutes.

125
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
 Yeah.

126
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,800
 So Turning Red, which is about May, a teenager who lives in Toronto with her parents.

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
 And basically she's got her thoughts.

128
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,040
 What happens during puberty to her family is that she turns into a giant red panda.

129
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
 It's great.

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
 Yeah.

131
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
 And basically she gets it.

132
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
 It's just great.

133
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,080
 She turns into this incredibly cute, cuddly red panda.

134
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,880
 And it's all about kind of familiar relationships and family responsibility and diaspora life.

135
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,160
 And it feels very kind of also quite specifically set in Toronto and in the kind of Chinese

136
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
 diaspora in Toronto.

137
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,720
 It's just, it's really good.

138
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,720
 And I think it ends really nicely as well.

139
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,640
 And just the hilarity of this girl.

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:21,040
 Like, and one thing Pixar does really well is kind of like the comedy of using the animation

141
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,000
 comedy of like making these hilarious figures.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,480
 I'm thinking of like, pay max in Big Hero 6, which I know is not certainly Pixar.

143
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,520
 You know, kind of these just big cuddly figures or like, um, Sully in Monsters Inc.

144
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,160
 But just this kind of great big red panda trying to hide under the bed and hide behind

145
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,920
 things is just a really cute visual comedy.

146
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
 And it was satisfying.

147
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,640
 And yeah, it seems to have like gone out in cinemas briefly and then gone away again.

148
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,920
 And then I watched it on Disney+.

149
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,560
 And I really enjoyed it.

150
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,080
 Do you want to do all the ones you've seen all at once Liz?

151
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,840
 And then Alison Kanada on the ones she's seen that you didn't mention.

152
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,920
 The question is, am I going out in left field and talking about video games since we don't

153
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,000
 have a video game category yet?

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Because basically...

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 No, you're not.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
 No, not I'd do that.

157
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
 Okay.

158
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,440
 But are you actually thinking of nominating some games because you can't, because you don't

159
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
 have a category for them?

160
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,320
 Yeah, because I always used to do this in best romantic presentation long form.

161
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,320
 I would always put a video game in and of course it would never get more than a handful

162
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,120
 of votes than never get anywhere, but I did it kind of in protest for the fact that there

163
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,840
 was no work better to put them.

164
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,880
 Yeah, so I will say here that if a game's a proper game, it isn't a dramatic presentation.

165
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,640
 But I understand that this is a very specialist for you to be.

166
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,960
 I believe we have had this argument before multiple times.

167
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
 Yeah, but it's a bit like the "Sergai-Luki-enko" thing.

168
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,840
 I do have to say it every time.

169
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,560
 I am not going to have the argument with you again because I've had this argument previously

170
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
 about why you were on.

171
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,880
 So I'm just going to continue talking about maybe dramatic presentations of the more traditional

172
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
 format.

173
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,840
 I mean, to the obvious one that I mean, I presume it's going to win and possibly win, you know,

174
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,560
 a million Oscars as well is everything everywhere or at once.

175
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
 Yup.

176
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,160
 You know, the fantastic tale of another story actually very much about kind of Chinese immigrant

177
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,600
 families a lot like "Tiny Red".

178
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,920
 But yeah, this again is about, but quite different, I think.

179
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,520
 I think quite different in tone, but I do have some kind of similar themes.

180
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,560
 Maybe if you watch "Tiny Red", although one is, you know, about more aimed at a child

181
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
 audience and involves a giant panda.

182
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,000
 And I don't recall there being any giant pandas in everything everywhere or at once,

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,160
 even though there are, you know, rocks and googly eyes and so on.

184
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
 Banned to be a giant panda, so well, there's a raccoon.

185
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
 It's probably one somewhere.

186
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
 There's a raccoon.

187
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
 The raccoon.

188
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,680
 So yes, if you haven't seen everything everywhere or at once, then turn off the podcast and

189
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,760
 go and watch everything everywhere or at once.

190
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,840
 And of course it's not a giant panda returning red, is it?

191
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,640
 It's a giant red panda.

192
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
 Is that a red panda?

193
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
 Yeah.

194
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
 Well, Octothorb, nitpick corner.

195
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
 I mean, yeah.

196
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,960
 But I think it's quite an important nitpick because, you know, dark pandas all get all

197
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,120
 the love and red pandas don't really get that much love.

198
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,280
 And do you want me to draw you all as red pandas this issue?

199
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
 I mean, yes.

200
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,440
 You know the red pandas, or you can draw us all as rocks with googly eyes that would

201
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,400
 also be acceptable and possibly easier.

202
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,000
 But yes, everything everywhere or at once.

203
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,480
 It's a great film about with Michelle Yeo as essentially a middle-aged Chinese immigrant

204
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,480
 woman who gets swept up in an adventure through the multiverse.

205
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,840
 And it's quite hard to describe beyond that because it's just really good.

206
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
 And it's got the everything bagel.

207
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
 So I just go and watch it basically.

208
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,080
 I'm not going to describe it any further.

209
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
 It's fair.

210
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
 Oh, I could.

211
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,360
 And the show notes to a podcast with the Daniels who wrote and directed it, which I found pretty

212
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
 interesting.

213
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,360
 If you want to hear more about how it came about and the other work.

214
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,000
 So what else on this list have I seen?

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I mean, I think we kind of covered that there are a few TV shows that I might nominate as

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 a series.

217
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,160
 The ones I'm thinking of is I have seen there is for all my kind, season three, severance

218
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
 season one.

219
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,840
 I'm not sure as any other TV shows I would consider nominating.

220
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,800
 And also I haven't seen quite a few of them.

221
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
 Andor?

222
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,960
 Oh, Andor, yes.

223
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,040
 So again, a question is like, just which one do I put it in?

224
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,560
 But I did think Andor had some very good individual episodes.

225
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
 So I'm up with those in.

226
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,200
 So I guess in terms of films, the other one I was thinking about is possibly don't worry

227
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,880
 darling widely.

228
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,440
 I think thought of as not very good at both the box office and with critics, but I though

229
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
 I enjoyed it.

230
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,680
 I watched it with John in person.

231
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
 Yes.

232
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
 Wow.

233
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,760
 And it's essentially got Florence Pugh as a 50s housewife in a glamorous utopia where

234
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,040
 every day the husbands got off to work and all the housewives are kind of left, you know,

235
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,680
 to live this 50s life.

236
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,640
 But it's incredibly unsettling from the start.

237
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,760
 Like, you know something is going on.

238
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,280
 And it's just got this very unsettling tone right from the start of knowing that something

239
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,400
 is going on and not being able to figure out exactly what is going on.

240
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,040
 What's so like, one division then?

241
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,160
 No, because it's more unsettling than one division because in one division, I think

242
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,640
 Wanda knows something's weird.

243
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,160
 And in this Florence Pugh doesn't.

244
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,800
 And I think that makes it, it's definitely feels more unsettling than one division.

245
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,320
 Yeah, it's got much more of a horror tone as well because you're like, you know, these

246
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,920
 are everyday people rather than, you know, a super powered woman.

247
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,840
 And so then you're like, what is going on?

248
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,440
 And it basically uses the idea, it's a very, maybe not original idea that, you know, you

249
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,280
 were trapped as a 1950s housewife, but is she literally trapped as a 1950s housewife

250
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
 and how?

251
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,240
 When I would say, it's as similar to what I always say about moon, which is although

252
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,560
 I don't think moon is like astonishingly original in terms of its idea.

253
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,720
 It is astonishingly original in terms of having that idea in a movie.

254
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,200
 And I think don't worry, darling is similar where I think I've seen similar concepts.

255
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,240
 But I don't think I've ever seen it in a mainstream movie directed by a woman before,

256
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,560
 which kind of is interesting.

257
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,720
 It's also interesting because Chris Pine is amazing in it.

258
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,520
 And I thought Harry Styles was very good.

259
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,960
 Initially, I thought Harry Styles was bad.

260
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,160
 And then I understood what role he was playing.

261
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,000
 And I was like, oh no, he's actually smashed it, which is always nice when the reveal at

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,880
 the end of the film makes it clear what an actor is doing.

263
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,640
 And you're like, oh, and I will say it was not well received by critics.

264
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:36,000
 I got 38% on Ron Tomatoes, but it has an audience score of 74%, which is quite the divide.

265
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,640
 And I do wonder whether people went into it thinking that it wasn't SF.

266
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,840
 And then, like, especially the critics went into it expecting something very different

267
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 and came out disappointed.

268
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,520
 But I think as an SF film, it's quite good.

269
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
 I enjoyed it.

270
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,200
 I would watch it again.

271
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
 Yeah.

272
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,120
 So I think I might also nominate that.

273
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,520
 I think almost almost all science fiction TV and movies uses tropes that we've previously

274
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,720
 seen in books or graphic novels.

275
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,480
 And I tend not to mark them down for that because I'm kind of like it would be a bit

276
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:19,680
 of a stretch to do a completely original science fiction concept as a movie given the budget

277
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,640
 that movies tend to need to make them work.

278
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,120
 You know, so I don't really mind.

279
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,440
 So having said that, everything everywhere, all at once, which is on my list, is pretty

280
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
 original.

281
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,680
 Yeah, and that's one of the good things about it.

282
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,720
 I mean, I think I don't want to say too much because I think if I dig deeply into where

283
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,960
 I think Don't Worry Darling may have been done on film before, then I will start giving away

284
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,200
 some of the interesting things about Don't Worry Darling.

285
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,000
 Yeah, no, I need to watch this one as well.

286
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,600
 Apparently, I have two to-do lists.

287
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
 What services is it on?

288
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 I don't know.

289
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,240
 We rented it off Amazon.

290
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,640
 It's now on HBO Go, but I don't think you can get HBO Go.

291
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,680
 So it may be on like now TV films or something.

292
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
 Not now.

293
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
 You know what I mean?

294
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
 No TV, but has movies.

295
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,080
 Yeah, and I think it does have what I felt was a sort of particularly, it felt like particularly

296
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,560
 2020's spin on it.

297
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,480
 And I won't say any more than that.

298
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,280
 Yes, I'd agree with that.

299
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,720
 I think what I would say is even when I thought it wasn't, you know, even though I think it

300
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,640
 is not amazing throughout, maybe it has some rough edges.

301
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,760
 It did get me thinking more than a lot of the stuff I've seen this year.

302
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,720
 So I think that is my initial set.

303
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,080
 And you should go now, go through things you might be nominating.

304
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,000
 And I might go, "Oh yeah, I watched that and forgot."

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,600
 So it was everything everywhere I wanted once.

306
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,360
 Don't worry, Darling.

307
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
 And turning red.

308
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
 Yes.

309
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,880
 I wanted to discuss a few movies.

310
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,840
 So first thing, I'm not putting any Marvel movies in my nominations.

311
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,680
 I thought all three of the Marvel movies that came out, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and

312
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,080
 Thor were solid, but I don't think any of them deserved to win.

313
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,800
 Hugo, I think what kind of forever will make it onto the nominations list because of what

314
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,960
 it represents.

315
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,320
 And it's very touching in some ways, but I didn't think it really worked for me as a

316
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,400
 film.

317
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,880
 It worked as a tribute, but not as a story.

318
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,760
 I will be nominating Pray, probably.

319
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,400
 Pray was very good.

320
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,520
 I've talked about it on the pod previously, so I will not talk about it again.

321
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,760
 And I will probably nominate Nope, which is the Jordan Peele movie.

322
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,080
 I love Jordan Peele.

323
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,160
 I think Nope is the weakest of his three movies, but you're talking like four out of five instead

324
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
 of five out of five.

325
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,640
 So like, it's tricky.

326
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,320
 And basically, I just like that there's intelligent, original horror on the big screen.

327
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
 I won't be nominating Neptune Frost.

328
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,920
 I won't see that.

329
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,600
 Neil Harrison, friend of the podcast, was like, "Oh, I don't work on Wednesdays.

330
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 We should go to the cinema on a Wednesday afternoon and see it."

331
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,040
 So me and his fanier took time off and then Neil flaked and then we had to watch Neptune

332
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,040
 Frost, which is not good.

333
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,040
 So you know, that was a fun afternoon.

334
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,840
 Do you think you've used this film or have been coloured in some way by being stood up?

335
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,360
 I went to see it excited about the idea of an original sci-fi movie that was like quite

336
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,840
 small and like, and I was not.

337
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
 It was not good.

338
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
 No, one over.

339
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
 Yeah, okay.

340
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
 No.

341
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
 I nominate Men.

342
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,280
 I enjoyed Men by Alex Garland.

343
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
 Quite a lot.

344
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,000
 Says quite a lot about how awful Men are, which I like.

345
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,200
 Turns out we're really awful.

346
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,200
 And it made me think that in a way that I don't, I know it intellectually, but it really gave

347
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,920
 me an insight into how scary Men are.

348
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,160
 And also, having watched Men and having watched Ex Machina, anyone who watches an Alex Garland

349
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,040
 film is like, "I wonder what Alex Garland thinks about gender.

350
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,480
 I wonder if he's a misogynist."

351
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
 No.

352
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
 What?

353
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
 Are you paying attention?

354
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
 We're awful.

355
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,880
 Anyway, the Men are not the good guys in his films, guys.

356
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,240
 Like, spoiler alert, the Men are the baddies.

357
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
 Except in Dred.

358
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,400
 But I don't think he's really talking about gender as much in Dred.

359
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,200
 He's talking about kick-ass judges and their morally questionable decision-making.

360
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,400
 And I also, yesterday, I watched Vespa.

361
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,720
 Vespa is interesting.

362
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,560
 It's a Lithuanian science fiction film.

363
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
 It is currently on Netflix in the UK.

364
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,400
 It was probably about 20 minutes too long.

365
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,160
 It is very downbeat.

366
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,000
 It is quite disgusting in places.

367
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,240
 But it was, I did enjoy it very much.

368
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,800
 I thought it was really good and real nice dystopian movie.

369
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,720
 So disgusting.

370
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,360
 Is that a gory or like poo or vomit or...?

371
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,400
 It's got a lot of blood in places, but it's in a world where humanity tried to respond

372
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,240
 to climate change with genetic engineering, and that went about as well as you might

373
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,560
 expect, and like everyone left his hold up in Citadel's except for the Paws who aren't.

374
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,920
 So far, so like, you know, this is a trope that's been done before.

375
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,560
 But like, the design is just amazing because like right at the beginning of the movie,

376
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,560
 you see a tree breathing and it's like, "Oh yeah, of course.

377
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,760
 If you go far enough down that road, you get trees that breathe.

378
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
 It's just so gross."

379
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,080
 You just see this tree breathing like, "Oh no, no, that is not, no, don't like."

380
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,160
 And there's like a lot of genetic technology.

381
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,400
 And it's just, yeah, it's very good, but it's very gross, but it's very good.

382
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,960
 I did like that a lot.

383
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,480
 Okay, so it's actually hitting up that things that make people go, "Oh, this is quick."

384
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 Yeah, I think so.

385
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
 I think it's doing on.

386
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,840
 And I think it does it well and on purpose.

387
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,000
 Those are my picks.

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,880
 So men with a question mark and prey and vesper are also like potentials as well as nope.

389
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,080
 They are all films I have heard of, but not watched.

390
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,320
 I mean, prey and nope are definitely my list of things to get through before the nomination

391
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
 period ends.

392
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,760
 So I will try to get to those.

393
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,480
 And men as well, actually.

394
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,080
 Mentioned everything I've seen, but this may need to go in an interjection.

395
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,360
 Before we stop talking about "Don't worry, darling," which I haven't seen but would

396
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,320
 like to, I need to mention something about Florence Pugh that I discovered since we last

397
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,280
 recorded, which is that Florence Pugh has a party trick.

398
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,600
 And it turns out that her party trick, she's like, "I don't know what it's called, but

399
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,320
 it's just the thing that you could do."

400
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,440
 And her party trick is the Astral Pole, which long time readers may know is a science

401
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,160
 fiction thing.

402
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,600
 From the '70s, I think the '70s or the early '80s in British fandom, where you step over

403
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,040
 a pole in increasingly implausible ways and don't take your hands off the pole, we will

404
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,160
 put a link to Florence Pugh doing the Astral Pole very competently in the show notes.

405
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,760
 If I can find it again.

406
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,760
 And yeah, if you could do the Astral Pole, please have a video.

407
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,080
 I could do the Astral Pole when I was about 20, but it's been a while.

408
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,280
 Can't now.

409
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,160
 I could never do the Astral Pole.

410
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,720
 I did when I was introduced to it in 2005 at the World Con Mining thing, Astral Shark,

411
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,080
 which is where instead of using a pole, you use an inflatable shark, which is quite bendy.

412
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,560
 And that is how I managed to do it.

413
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,760
 But now I suspect I could not even do the Astral Shark.

414
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,600
 And we're going to have a 2024 Glasgow World Con rerun of this event in which people who

415
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,360
 could do the Astral Pole in 2005 try it again and I'll put their backs out.

416
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 Yay!

417
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,040
 But otherwise, the only other thing I was going to mention was that we haven't mentioned

418
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,800
 the TV shows we're going to, because I am going to put Andor and Severance for sure

419
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,200
 on my long form list, as well as having a second bite of the cherry in short form, unless

420
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,480
 some Hugo's rule lawyer tells me that's a terrible idea.

421
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,240
 You put Russian Doll Season 2 in the show notes and I would describe it as aggressively

422
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
 fine.

423
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,480
 So, Russian Doll Season 1 was fantastic, but I didn't feel like it needed anything more

424
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
 going on.

425
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,880
 And I couldn't see how Russian Doll Season 2 would actually add anything to it.

426
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,520
 So it's not that I don't intend to watch it.

427
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,200
 I do intend to watch it at some point, but it just seemed like it was not likely to be

428
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
 as exciting.

429
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,680
 I think Season 2 could have been great if they'd done it well.

430
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,640
 It doesn't quite come together doing too many different things.

431
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,920
 In the absence of a best game Hugo, I have for some years been putting video games into

432
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,920
 best romantic presentation long form on the ground so they don't fit anywhere else and

433
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,000
 I like nominating video games things.

434
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,400
 And we have now passed the idea of best game Hugo, but not ratified it.

435
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,120
 And so I'm going to continue the tradition for one more year, probably by putting Horizon

436
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,200
 for Bidding West on best romantic presentation long form, because it's great.

437
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,600
 That is great.

438
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
 I've been taking my sweet time.

439
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
 Yeah.

440
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,800
 Isn't it like to finish the first one shouldn't I?

441
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 You should.

442
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
 I think you can get the second one now.

443
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,440
 I think it's free on one of the PlayStation Plus tiers, but don't ask me to explain different

444
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,680
 PlayStation Plus tiers.

445
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
 It's good.

446
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,840
 It's not quite as good as the first one, but I think it would still be worthy of a Hugo

447
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,880
 and so I will nominate it and it will not go anywhere.

448
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
 But that's fine.

449
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,320
 I mean, I feel like Horizon is now one of the best things never to have won a Hugo.

450
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
 Hot take.

451
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,200
 I mean, there will be DLC in 2023, right?

452
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,720
 There will be in theory eligible for Hugo in 2024.

453
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,320
 The catch is that the DLC is only for PlayStation 5.

454
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
 So.

455
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:10,640
 And also the other catch is that it will be going up against Breath of the Wild 2, right?

456
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,440
 Of the news elder, yeah.

457
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,760
 Which should not win a Hugo, but which probably will.

458
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,840
 I mean, it might be great.

459
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,280
 They might have undone all of the things that were wrong with Breath of the Wild and

460
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,760
 made a real great sequel.

461
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
 But I suspect not.

462
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
 We'll see.

463
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,280
 I mean, I love Zelda, but I kind of think that it's not really exciting science fiction

464
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,040
 in the way that Horizon is.

465
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,120
 Do you fight any Robert dinosaurs in Zelda?

466
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
 It really depends on your definition of robot and your definition of dinosaur.

467
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,800
 Oh, see now I'm more interested in it.

468
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,920
 Generic, it's just generic fantasy.

469
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,880
 All of the Zelda stuff is generic fantasy tautel, right?

470
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,360
 The backstory is not what you're playing this game for.

471
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
 Oh yeah.

472
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,520
 Well, one of the really annoying things about Breath of the Wild is that it really wanted

473
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,920
 you to care about like Zelda's mental state.

474
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,520
 And I'm like, I've never cared about any of the characters in this franchise, guys.

475
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,240
 That is not why I come to a Zelda game.

476
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,080
 I come for the intricate dungeons of which there were none.

477
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,560
 For fine and 120 quite poor.

478
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
 Yeah.

479
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,120
 For me, Breath of the Wild is a real triumph of quantity over quality.

480
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
 There was lots to do.

481
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,360
 Most of it was fine, which I didn't enjoy.

482
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
 Um, we can.

483
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
 I mean, I enjoyed it fine.

484
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,520
 We're writing for Bidden best into best related work.

485
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
 So that's the thing that people can do.

486
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
 No.

487
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
 Right, okay.

488
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,880
 So the official, the official Octa thought perspective is you should nominate Horizon

489
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,440
 Forbidden West in every category and let the admin decide which one it should have gone

490
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
 in.

491
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,760
 Actually, probably not a short story, no, I'll let on my valet because it probably does

492
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,600
 have more than 40,000 words in it.

493
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,080
 I am a purist, but I think when best related work says it should be notable for things

494
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,160
 other than the fictional text, I feel I should not nominate fictional texts.

495
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
 Hang on.

496
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
 Oh, no.

497
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,560
 Horizon Zero Dawn is notable for, or Horizon Forbidden Village is notable for robot dinosaurs.

498
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
 Right?

499
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,320
 They are not textual robot dinosaurs.

500
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,720
 If you didn't have robot dinosaurs, you wouldn't care about the text as much.

501
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,960
 What, they're metatextual dinosaurs or something.

502
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,600
 They're literal dinosaurs.

503
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
 No.

504
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,360
 They're not, they're like, they're like in your face dinosaurs.

505
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
 It's not the text.

506
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,120
 But are you interpreting text?

507
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,520
 I mean, only text on a page here, Alison.

508
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,000
 Oh, no.

509
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Um, maybe.

510
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,920
 Yeah, no, I think it is part of the text.

511
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,280
 Are you being very purist on your definition of text?

512
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,200
 You see, the text is, you know, the work.

513
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,160
 And I would say that the, uh, fictional dinosaurs are part of the fictional text.

514
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
 Mm.

515
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,960
 I think I agree with Liz here, Alison.

516
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
 I'm afraid.

517
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,600
 Yeah, no, Liz is right.

518
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
 I'm wrong.

519
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
 Fine.

520
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
 Boo.

521
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
 Ah-ha.

522
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 Put that in the soundboard.

523
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
 Boo, boo, boo.

524
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,200
 I'm just glad that the title of the episode is going to be metatextual dinosaurs.

525
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,600
 And no one is going to understand that they're going to think it's one thing from the

526
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,400
 title and it will be something totally different.

527
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
 And then it's best-related work.

528
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,080
 I'm not sure I've read any related works this year.

529
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,480
 I know that the, um, Terry Pratchett biography by Rob Wilkins is in this category.

530
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,640
 Oh, no, shoot.

531
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,480
 I have, um, uh, management lessons from Westeros by Fiona Moore.

532
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,120
 You should all nominate that.

533
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,440
 Nominate it for best-related work.

534
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,040
 Management lessons from Game of Thrones is its proper title.

535
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,680
 And we have been meaning to have this as a pick for ages, but haven't actually managed

536
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
 to do it.

537
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,920
 So, um, it's very, very good, very funny and also quite illuminating.

538
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,240
 And it's now her, it's now her, um, thing.

539
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,400
 So she's starting to do management lessons from Star Wars and things of this kind.

540
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,560
 So I'm very much hoping we're going to see a lot more of this sort of thing.

541
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
 Yeah.

542
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,800
 I am hyped for that.

543
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,800
 And we'll be nominating that when it comes out to, I mean, assuming it's good by a guy,

544
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
 I imagine it won't be good.

545
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,320
 So I know that there's much of a risk.

546
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,640
 So the Rob Wilkins book and the Fiona Moore book are both things you could consider nominating.

547
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,380
 I've not read the Rob Wilkins biography of Terry Pratchett, but everyone I know who has

548
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,040
 read it says it was fantastic.

549
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:16,640
 So, uh, I'm starting the nomination campaign now for next year, next year, all these worlds,

550
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,440
 reviews and essays by Neil Harrison, uh, needs to be on that balla listeners.

551
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,540
 Uh, so buy it and read it now so you can nominate it so that it's on the ballot in Glasgow

552
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,000
 so that Neil can win.

553
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,800
 We've got a plan and we're doing it.

554
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,360
 Claire has mentioned in this space, um, the Peter Nichols collection, genre fiction of

555
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,480
 the roaring years, which I think I had a pick on Octthorpe and which I also enjoyed very

556
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,840
 much.

557
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,400
 And there are other books in Langford series of, um, fan history books that you might want

558
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,440
 to think about nominated in this category.

559
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,640
 None of them have any chance of winning, I don't think, but you know, the good books.

560
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
 They're all good books, Brent.

561
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,200
 They're not all good books, but most of them are good books.

562
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,280
 Yes, Alison picked that on episode 71, just nearly froze to death.

563
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,960
 If you want to hear more about her thoughts on it there, have you got any best related,

564
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
 um, things Liz?

565
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,360
 I don't think I have.

566
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,160
 I was looking at, um, because obviously like individual essays and things are, would be

567
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
 eligible.

568
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
 Yeah.

569
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,400
 Uh, but the strange horizons, criticism, uh, issue that I liked so much is actually 2023,

570
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,840
 so that will be for next year's ballot.

571
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,160
 And I don't think I read a lot of nonfiction related science fiction that isn't, you know,

572
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,960
 book reviews and essays and so on and online sources, most of which are covered by the

573
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
 semi-prozines.

574
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
 So, yeah.

575
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,520
 So then we go to Best Graphic Story or Comic.

576
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,040
 I've really dropped out here.

577
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,680
 I mean, I used to read quite a lot of comics and I've ended up reading basically no comics,

578
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,760
 so I don't actually have anything to put in this category.

579
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,960
 I'm not even up to date with kind of, you know, perennial, what I'd say perennial, Hugo

580
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,480
 favourites like monstrous and so on.

581
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
 Yeah.

582
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:57,640
 I find that my taste in this category is quite different from the Hugo electorate more generally.

583
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,720
 I mean, I'll probably look through my Marvel Unlimited and work out what I want to nominate

584
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,680
 by strongly suspect that it will not get on the ballot.

585
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,000
 If I was going to advocate for one thing from Marvel Unlimited that I've read, it would

586
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,200
 be the most recent run of Moon Knight, which I thought was really, really excellent as a

587
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
 comic.

588
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,520
 So I would go for that one, which I believe is Volume 9, which I believe does extend into

589
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
 it.

590
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,640
 It started in 2021, but I believe there is a volume in 2022 because it has been ongoing

591
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,920
 and it has won the Golden Issue Award for Best Ongoing Comic.

592
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,640
 So yeah, I'm not the only one who likes it listeners.

593
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,760
 Oh, and Moon Knight Black White and Blood number one was in May 2022.

594
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,720
 So yes, I'll be nominating some Moon Knight.

595
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,520
 But yeah, I don't think it'll be on the ballot.

596
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,160
 So any comics, Alison?

597
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
 No.

598
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,840
 And then it's Best Series.

599
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,440
 So Liz, you have a couple of picks here, I think.

600
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,960
 I do have a couple of Best Series, which cross over as well with my picks in Best Novel

601
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,440
 and Best in Load Star Awards, which is I am going to pick Robert Jackson Bennett's Foundry

602
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,440
 Side Trilogy, which I think was exceptionally good.

603
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,760
 The Last Book of Gloatlands was published last year, if you like sort of secondary world,

604
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,520
 fantasy series, then why we've mixed it up already.

605
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,120
 I will also be picking No, We, No, Big's Golden Enclave series, where the first one's

606
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,840
 Color Man's Awards nominated for the Load Star before.

607
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,880
 But I think the second and third books are actually better than the first one and do open

608
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,920
 out the world in a way I enjoyed.

609
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,040
 I mean, I've got some quibbles about them, but I think they're worthy of going in Best

610
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
 Series.

611
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,160
 I'm going to also nominate Probably The Cemeteries of Amala by Katherine Addison, which is a series

612
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,360
 of sort of murder mysteries in the Goblin Emperor universe and the work for that would

613
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,480
 be Good Grief of Stones that was published this year.

614
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,200
 I don't think they're the best books ever, but I do find them kind of always pleasant

615
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,360
 and pleasantly fun to read, as they may go in there.

616
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,600
 I did also notice that Cora Vullet has pointed out that Elric is eligible for Best Series

617
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
 this year.

618
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
 Or is feeling super retro?

619
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,280
 Well, there's more published a new Elric novel because that would be awesome.

620
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,320
 Apparently he has published a new Elric something.

621
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,720
 I'm just looking up to see if it is a novel or a collection of short stories or a short

622
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 piece or whatever.

623
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,520
 But yes, apparently there was a new Elric in 2022 and so you can nominate the whole of

624
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,200
 Elric if you really want to.

625
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,920
 I mean, I've read the first one, but not however many other novels are in the series.

626
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,120
 So one I will be nominating for Best Series is the Children of Time, Children of Memory,

627
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:47,600
 Trilogy by N. Tricofsky, which is very good and I think would be a worthy winner of the

628
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,560
 Best Series Hugo.

629
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:56,000
 I believe Tricofsky's other, the final architecture series is also eligible.

630
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,320
 No, because there's only been two out so far and the third one is 2023.

631
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,160
 Ah, so nominate that one next year listeners.

632
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
 That will be next year.

633
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,880
 But I mean, thinking about it, I think the Children of Time series may also be eligible

634
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:16,080
 next year because the third book is out 2023 in the US.

635
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,520
 So that's going to be very complicated.

636
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,160
 I am well, don't split the Tricofsky vote next year guys.

637
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
 Nominate them both.

638
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,360
 I want to fly the plaid for some other British series.

639
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,560
 I think that Fractured Europe by Dave Hutchinson is eligible because although the fifth book

640
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,400
 that came out in 2022 is kind of sideways to the other four, it's still set in the same

641
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,280
 universe and I think that counts for the purposes of Best Series.

642
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,320
 And I also want to shout out the fellow sister series by Liz Williams, which is the one

643
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,480
 that starts with Comic Weather and the Green Man series by Juliet McKenna, both of which

644
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,360
 are eligible and both of which contain books that I have enjoyed very much indeed though

645
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,040
 as always with series, I've never read the whole series, not for donkey's ears afterwards,

646
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,320
 you know what it's like, but they have both got great books in them.

647
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,160
 Retrospectively realized that given that Alistair Reynolds published a new revelation

648
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:17,360
 space novel in 2021, even though I didn't really like it, it would have been eligible

649
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
 as a series as a whole.

650
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,040
 And I do like the series as a whole.

651
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,800
 However, he wrote another one that will be coming out in 2023 so I can have this whole

652
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,080
 conversation again next year.

653
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,720
 Yeah, we should have this conversation at more length next year.

654
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,440
 We should make a plan earlier in the year.

655
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,880
 Alright, then it's on to short stories.

656
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,360
 Alison, how's your short story beading bin this year?

657
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,200
 So 2023 has been a thing so far.

658
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,360
 So normally I do a pile of short story reading in the first couple of months of the year.

659
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,080
 Well, you know, a dozen or so haven't done any.

660
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,160
 So if you've ever hankered after an episode of Octa thought where John and Liz do it as

661
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,200
 a two-hander and I don't say a word.

662
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,600
 The next 20 minutes or so for you.

663
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,920
 Moving to short stories.

664
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,360
 My first short story is a very short story, cocking in at under 1500 words by Margaret

665
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,320
 Dunlap in Uncanny 45.

666
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,400
 I really like it.

667
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
 It's fantasy.

668
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:22,720
 It's kind of in a similar world's toy story in that toys are sentient beings.

669
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,920
 And it's just, yeah, it's just very, I just found it very poignant.

670
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,800
 And I really liked it. It was very simple, but it was very effective.

671
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,840
 Does not take long to read.

672
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,320
 As my first story links to all these short stories are in the show notes.

673
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:45,200
 Okay, so my first short story is I've chosen Critical Mass by Peter Watts from Lightspeed

674
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:53,000
 magazine, which is about Leo Gregory, who's kind of a future architect who finds his studio

675
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,400
 vandalized and it's partly about trying to work out, you know, who vandalized his studio,

676
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,880
 but partly about all these artworks of his that are being vandalized around the world.

677
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,600
 And you know, it said in this kind of, I don't know what feels like now a fairly standard

678
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:13,920
 near future dystopia of bio hackers, gen engineering things and refugees and climate change.

679
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,840
 But I kind of liked how that was sort of the background thing.

680
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,720
 And what I actually, what I really liked about it is I read a lot of short stories that didn't

681
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,360
 actually go anywhere on the level of ending.

682
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,800
 And this one feels like it has an actual ending.

683
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,760
 So this one's going on my ballot.

684
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
 Nice.

685
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:38,360
 On the subject of stories that had an ending is Transference by Vivian Shaw.

686
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,040
 So this was in Uncanny 49.

687
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,440
 I really love this story. It might be my favorite of the four that I am going to nominate.

688
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:52,280
 It is a story about magical tattoos, which are subject I've always been fascinated by.

689
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,480
 And I'm not really sure why, but like I've always been, always been completely entranced

690
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,160
 by the idea of kind of magic that works through tattoos, which I think is why I like the painted

691
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,360
 man series quite so much.

692
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,840
 And yeah, it's just amazing.

693
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,800
 And I then discovered that Vivian Shaw is married to Arcady Martin and I am very jealous

694
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,120
 of the amount of story writing prowess that exists in that partnership.

695
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,280
 My second and third choices actually are in a way very well linked together.

696
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,880
 So my second choice is Rabbit Test by Uncanny magazine.

697
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,880
 And you might be able to guess what it's about from the title.

698
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,040
 It is essentially again about a sort of future dystopia, but it's about one with control

699
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,760
 of women's reproduction.

700
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,520
 So the framing story is kind of a girl, Grace who's under 18 and it's 2091 and there's

701
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,720
 basically an app that is going to automatically administer pregnancy tests on women in a world

702
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,560
 where abortion is not allowed.

703
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,040
 And the rabbit test of the title is because that's historically how pregnancy tests were

704
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,640
 done before we invented the lateral flow test.

705
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,480
 It's Grace's story, but with the interjections from the past of abortion and reproductive

706
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,240
 justice and activism.

707
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:10,360
 Yeah, I think it is quite, like it's definitely got a message and it's quite firm in its message,

708
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:18,600
 but I think it feels pretty timely and I did enjoy the story enough to include it.

709
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:25,480
 I really enjoyed the setup and I really enjoyed the beginning of the story, but it was in

710
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,120
 contrast to your previous bit where you said the ending really landed.

711
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,280
 I thought this was a story that just sort of stopped and that is why I haven't got it

712
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,000
 on my list to nominate.

713
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,040
 But it has also been nominated for an Ebula, so it clearly struck chords with a variety

714
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
 of people.

715
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,960
 Yeah, I think it feels like that story that comes along at precisely the right time to

716
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,840
 land with people.

717
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,000
 My next pick is Family Cooking by Anna Maria Curtis.

718
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,200
 If I had to, like I think if it wasn't transparent, so my favourite, it would be this one, because

719
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,480
 this one is also just so good.

720
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:09,240
 It's about someone who is magic and their magic lets them make great food, but at the

721
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,200
 beginning of the story, they can no longer make great food and the story is kind of about

722
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,760
 why that is.

723
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:23,600
 And it's about family and about emotion and about whether or not your emotions are something

724
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,680
 you can live with.

725
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,360
 It's just very, very good and I really liked it.

726
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,720
 It made me, and it really resonated with me for personal reasons as well.

727
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,480
 So yeah, I just, I do ordered this story.

728
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,080
 Do you have magical powers for making great food, John?

729
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
 No.

730
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,600
 So my third pick relatedly, and actually probably my favourite of the three I've got at the

731
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,040
 moment is, again from light speed, it's called the CRISPR cookbook, a guide to biohacking

732
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,640
 your own abortion in a postural world.

733
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,960
 And it is exactly that basically it's supposedly a manual for like how you are going to biohack

734
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,720
 yourselves to perform an abortion in the future where it is illegal.

735
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,160
 I just thought it was very kind of solidly written.

736
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,520
 It's written as though it's like a, you know, a bit like a scientific manual, which as far

737
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,480
 as I can tell is also kind of completely, completely accurate as far as it goes.

738
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,480
 And it's pretty short and kind of doesn't outstay it's welcome and ends the kind of

739
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,160
 this note of like, okay, so if we're going to biohack ourselves to do this, what else

740
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,760
 are we going to biohack ourselves to do?

741
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,120
 And so I really enjoyed it.

742
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:33,120
 And it is by a pseudonymous author whose name I think is like the start of the CRISPR enzyme

743
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,920
 protein sequence, which is pretty neat.

744
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,720
 And I also, I very much like the, so light speed has like pages for all the authors that

745
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,200
 have written fiction for the magazine.

746
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,440
 And I very much like the author page for the author who wrote this.

747
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,400
 I've linked it in the show notes.

748
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,760
 I won't say it here, but it's very good.

749
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,440
 My last one is Lily the Immortal, which is the longest of the four I'm nominating.

750
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:02,240
 And I think I've inadvertently guys, I've picked four stories about feelings.

751
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
 What?

752
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,680
 It was just, I know none of them are about lasers, Liz.

753
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,800
 So it's like you have feelings, John.

754
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:16,040
 But this one's very good and is about grief in the wake of losing a friend and about how

755
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,920
 technology might help or hinder that process.

756
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,160
 And I really liked it.

757
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,400
 It kind of feels like it's dealing with some of the same themes as Westworld season three

758
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,760
 but I think it does more with them in 60, in 6,000 words.

759
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,600
 Westworld season three did over the course of 10 hours.

760
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,400
 So there is that onto novelttes.

761
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:43,080
 So full disclosure, my picks for novelttes are, I mean, I think I like all three of them

762
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:48,560
 very much and I haven't kind of tried to find five to nominate because I have definitely

763
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,600
 like thresholded at kind of ones I think are worthy.

764
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,760
 But like it is definitely true.

765
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,120
 I have read fewer novelttes than short stories.

766
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,360
 So I think the short stories I picked out are probably a little bit stronger than the

767
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,440
 novelttes but you know, your mileage may vary.

768
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,880
 Do you want to go first, Liz?

769
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
 I can go first.

770
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,480
 So I will say also that I've read many fewer novelttes than short stories when I was going

771
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,120
 through kind of things recommended from online venues.

772
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,880
 They were really heavily slanted towards short stories.

773
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,800
 And I mean, I read a few novelttes I just didn't think were worth nominating and then

774
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,640
 there's kind of this extra investment of time in the novelttes which means I'm kind of

775
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,960
 less like you take a chance on like a novellette or even a novella by someone I haven't had

776
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,920
 recommended which is a long way of saying that what I did do was I read a bunch of short

777
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,160
 fiction that was put together by Amazon in one of the kind of free collections and I'm

778
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,880
 going to nominate three items from that.

779
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,840
 And I think these ones are novelttes but I'm guessing because I don't actually know how

780
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
 long they are.

781
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,960
 Anyway, so the first one is The Sixth Set Death of the Saint by Alex Harrow which is about

782
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,840
 a woman in a sort of quasi-medieval fantasy world who becomes the kingdom's greatest warrior

783
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,560
 and it turns out she is basically endlessly repeating her own story and dying and then

784
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,560
 getting slightly further or in the service of making a man like the emperor of the world

785
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,480
 and then how she takes it back into her own hands and I enjoyed it.

786
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,760
 And then there's What the Dead Know by Nivor which is from the same collection but kind

787
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,480
 of a totally different feel.

788
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,600
 I thought this one had a very sort of eerie feel to it.

789
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,760
 It's about a woman who is posing as kind of a spirit medium who can channel the voice

790
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,400
 of the dead in a world where the dead do actually exist and rise as ghosts and it's

791
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,080
 all about how they go off to one place to kind of channel the voices of the dead and

792
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,760
 end up meeting a ghost there.

793
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,520
 And I think it's just this one I just felt was really kind of well written and really

794
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,160
 well characterised in a short time.

795
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
 So that is mine.

796
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,440
 I'm also going to nominate one of John's as well but I'll let him talk about that.

797
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,000
 I'm going to pick Your Eyes My Beacon being an account of several Mr Dventures and How

798
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,520
 I Found My Way Home by C.L. Clark.

799
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:07,200
 This is about a lighthouse keeper and someone they meet and they're both quite lonely.

800
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,520
 It's quite good.

801
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,200
 They also have some genre elements but you know they're good too.

802
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,560
 I like this one quite a lot and I thought it was, I don't know, I don't know why it

803
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
 just spoke to me and it was nice.

804
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:26,560
 I'm going to pick Two Hands Wrapped in Gold by S.B. Divya.

805
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:37,800
 This is a story about a young girl who has a magic power and it doesn't necessarily go

806
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,040
 as well as you would ideally like.

807
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,480
 Although it kind of does.

808
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,600
 I'm good at snopsizing short stories.

809
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,600
 Very carefully worded to avoid new spoilers that John and the world on.

810
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,680
 And then is my favourite novelt and I believe Liz is also planning to nominate this one

811
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,000
 which is If You Find Yourself Speaking to God, Address God with the Informal You by

812
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,500
 John Chu.

813
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,080
 This I believe also got nominated for a nebula.

814
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,080
 I just loved it.

815
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,080
 I thought it was great.

816
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:13,440
 It basically like, I guess you find God in the least likely places and this story is

817
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,240
 an example of that.

818
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,360
 But yeah, and just very human and very low key but also very big.

819
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,040
 I liked the juxtaposition of scales.

820
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,640
 And then it's onto Novellas.

821
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:33,520
 I've got One Novella which is Radcliffe Hall by Miyuki Jane Pinkard in Uncanny 48.

822
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,440
 I quite liked it.

823
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,120
 I'm more nominating it because it's the Novella I read rather than because I think it was

824
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,480
 like amazing but I did really enjoy it.

825
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:50,600
 It's got, you know, it's kind of a sapphic, creepy, almost Lovecraftian story set in an

826
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,680
 old boarding school.

827
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,680
 So like it's hitting a lot of things I like in fiction all in one story.

828
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,400
 And so I don't know, you know, it might not be high art but I liked it quite a lot.

829
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,640
 All right, so I'm nominating two Novellas.

830
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,640
 At least I think so because I don't know if undercover by Tamzemir is a Novella or a

831
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,640
 novelt.

832
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,400
 This is partly because it came from this Amazon collection where I just get page counts.

833
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,880
 But anyway, it is the only thing of Tamzemir has I read that isn't, you know, Gideon the

834
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,960
 9th which he's obviously come to fame for.

835
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,120
 But this I really liked.

836
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,600
 It's about kind of, you know, a newcomer in, she comes into town where there's, you know,

837
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:33,640
 the gang leader who runs a burlesque show but kind of one of her star burlesque dancers

838
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,400
 is a ghoul.

839
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:42,360
 And this newcomer who comes into town is basically an undercover cop who is trying to track down

840
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,240
 and get rid of these ghouls before they start eating everyone.

841
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,720
 And yeah, it's just, it's good.

842
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,040
 It's, I like all the kind of, you know, it's very evocative when you go and see this ghoul

843
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,240
 she seems very kind of non-human and human.

844
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,200
 It's sort of got this like saloon kind of feeling.

845
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,480
 They're in the burlesque show.

846
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,480
 They've got the saloon.

847
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,480
 I don't know.

848
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,960
 It just, it just feels like a very different setting in which to put this when you could

849
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,280
 have just put it in kind of like a city somewhere where she was hunting ghouls.

850
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,760
 She's put a lot of effort into the setting as well.

851
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,120
 So I really liked that one.

852
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,960
 My last Novella pick is the 2-Dock Skorsky by Isaac Falman which is from Tor.com.

853
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,200
 This is one of the standalone Novellas and this is, I believe it's what the kids call

854
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,120
 Dark Akademia.

855
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:34,000
 It's about a graduate student who essentially is forced to leave her and academic position

856
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,880
 and become a student in a different institution under an infamous magician who is known for,

857
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,120
 well, he's mostly known for having created a homunculus of himself when younger, which

858
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,320
 is something that we just need to do in this universe that kind of splits you into two

859
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,360
 parts and takes part of your personality with you.

860
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:58,040
 And it's really all about the student's kind of connection with both of these split parts

861
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,040
 of this personality.

862
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,800
 And yeah, I really enjoyed it.

863
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,280
 We're out of the short fiction minds readers so Alison can come back and then Novell.

864
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,400
 I mean, my novel picks are quite, I'm from a quite straightforward.

865
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,200
 I already mentioned Robert Jackson Bennett's Locklands trilogy and I'm going to nominate

866
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,960
 Locklands the third book in that series.

867
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,200
 I don't expect to be on the ballot because the third book in a trilogy very rarely makes

868
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,880
 onto the ballot if the first two didn't.

869
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,240
 But it's really good.

870
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
 I really enjoyed it.

871
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,480
 I cried on a plane reading this book and I've also had it as a pick.

872
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,120
 So yeah, you should go and watch them.

873
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
 Read them.

874
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,120
 Makes sense.

875
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:37,520
 I was sent a copy of Sea of Tranquility by Emily Cintron-Mantle by Roy Kettle who really

876
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,760
 liked it and recommended it but said, "Oh, I have passed the point of my life where I

877
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,560
 keep all my books."

878
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,680
 So I got that in the post and read it just the other couple of days.

879
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,680
 If we'd just be doing a normal octothop it could have been a pick.

880
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,360
 And I thought it was very good indeed.

881
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:57,640
 I like novels that feel like proper novels.

882
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,760
 So I like novels that are sparse and elegant and do what they need to do and do not control

883
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,840
 anything extraneous.

884
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,960
 And I like it even better when they are genre which this one is and it is a lovely novel

885
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:15,440
 about time travel and the nature of reality and the...and it's got historical bits and

886
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,760
 current day bits and future bits and it's just fantastic and I strongly recommend it

887
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,200
 to everyone and it's also very short so it will not cause you to give up a fortnight of

888
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,920
 your life getting it read.

889
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,920
 It's fine.

890
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,720
 It's an easy read for an afternoon.

891
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,040
 Strongly recommended definitely going on my ballot.

892
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,880
 Thank you Claire, Briley, off-croydon for the recommendation.

893
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,880
 Yes.

894
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,880
 So I believe this is eligible and I think Abigail Nisbahn said that she would be a little bit

895
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,520
 but she was nominating it.

896
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,560
 But then when I checked my goodreads it said it was published in 2020.

897
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,720
 But I think it was published in Finnish in 2020 and it was published in English in 2022

898
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,520
 which is why it is eligible and it is the Moon Day Letters by Emi Iteranta.

899
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,960
 This is something Neil Harrison and Nick Cloud brought me for a birthday.

900
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,720
 I talked about it in a previous octa thought.

901
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,560
 I really liked it.

902
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
 It is worth noting.

903
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,560
 It's Panea.

904
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,240
 I think it's read say bounced off it because she was like I find this book very difficult

905
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,200
 because of how utterly stupid the main character is and I was like I could see that reading.

906
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:18,200
 I think we're supposed to, I think Iteranta is supposed, is trying to bring us to conclusions

907
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,880
 about what is going on before the main character gets there and I quite liked that sense of

908
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,880
 dramatic tension.

909
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,840
 I think if Spani had found it absolutely infuriating that the main character wasn't also reaching

910
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,640
 the same conclusions because they were blending the obvious and I can see how that could have

911
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,720
 been frustrating if you weren't enjoying that part of the ride.

912
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,600
 Yes, I did like it and I will be nominating it.

913
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,680
 Oh, back to me.

914
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:46,720
 I am going to possibly steal one of John here because I am going for the spearkutch through

915
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,000
 water by Simon Jimenez which is his second novel.

916
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:00,480
 It's a fantasy novel about essentially two young men going on a quest to save the moon

917
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,040
 and reset the world they are living in.

918
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:10,000
 But it's also got these kind of layers of framing stories from people who are in the

919
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,200
 same world but later which is not our world but feels adjacent to our world and what they

920
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,840
 see in dreams and the show they see in a kind of stage show they see in dreams that frames

921
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,840
 it all.

922
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:28,800
 It kind of takes what might be a fairly straightforward secondary world, kind of interesting fantasy

923
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,720
 quest and makes it so much better by having all these extra intricate layers on top and

924
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,160
 weaving them all together throughout and it was quite tricky.

925
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,640
 It's quite a long book as well I think maybe a little bit longer than it needs to be but

926
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,320
 I feel it does bring all these threads together very neatly at the end and I really enjoyed

927
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,320
 it.

928
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:54,840
 I will also be nominating City of Last Chances by Adrian Tchaikovsky which is a stone cold

929
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,320
 masterpiece.

930
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,480
 It's just so good because it's got like two full pages of dramatic personi at the beginning

931
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,960
 and reading that I was a bit like oh god this is going to be one of those fantasy novels

932
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,360
 where there are a million characters and I have to keep referring back.

933
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:13,880
 But the way Tchaikovsky threads the plot through the characters and through the settings means

934
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:19,720
 that although you go all over this incredibly intricate city and although you have all of

935
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,920
 these different characters and although the world feels incredibly big and incredibly

936
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,040
 real you never feel lost within it.

937
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:33,320
 He is so good at bridging between characters and settings in a way that means you always

938
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,400
 feel grounded and you always know where you are and it is just it was just so good.

939
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,440
 It's not quite like anything else I've ever read and it was amazing and I will be enthusiastically

940
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,440
 nominating it.

941
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,640
 I am super looking forward to this one.

942
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,120
 Oh and one that Tchaikovsky also read which I'll nominate for a laugh while I don't think

943
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:55,920
 will be on the ballot is Day of Ascension which is the Warhammer 40,000 book he wrote about

944
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,280
 Jean Stelers.

945
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,000
 I suspect most of the Hugo electorate have not read it but oh boy it's a fun read.

946
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,520
 Yeah I think of Tchaikovsky's five 22 novels that's probably at the bottom of you know

947
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,360
 how many people are likely to nominate it.

948
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,440
 I believe there are only four Liz.

949
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,080
 Only four I'm sorry okay.

950
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,360
 I think so.

951
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,120
 Well Garen and Wright are fair so we can have the old Tchaikovsky shortlist please.

952
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:24,940
 I just want to say one quick word which is that there is a novel bable by R.F.

953
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,080
 Quang that is incredibly polarizing amongst my friends list.

954
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,360
 I have loads of people saying it's the best thing they read last year and loads of people

955
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,000
 sing yeah it's not that much.

956
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,680
 So I just think if you're interested in books that polarize people that might be one to

957
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
 read in the next eight days.

958
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,000
 It's going to be on the shortlist anyway so it's going to be on the shortlist anyway

959
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,040
 but also it's really long and so if you're going to read one book in the next eight days

960
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,400
 maybe you don't pick one of the longest options you could possibly pick.

961
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,520
 I'd pick a shorter one you've got a better chance of finishing.

962
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,800
 Read all of our short fiction picks first.

963
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,520
 Yes yes.

964
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,520
 That is my plan.

965
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,280
 Alright now we're done John.

966
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,240
 And we don't get to do best game till next year.

967
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
 No.

968
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,320
 I'm going to play lots of games in 2023.

969
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,320
 Yeah.

970
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,160
 That was the old thought podcast and it's goodbye from me.

971
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,160
 It's goodbye from me.

972
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,160
 It's goodbye from me.

973
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:38,440
 [Music]

974
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,000
 We're not doing picks this episode because we're doing a special Hugo nominations all

975
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,360
 the time episode and then we're going to do another episode about all the other stuff

976
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,360
 that's happened but we do have to tell you about what would have been my pick if we

977
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,800
 were doing picks which is the EasterCon catch up.

978
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:59,720
 So if you're a member of the EasterCon then you probably do know that almost every program

979
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:06,520
 item we did is available to watch for another couple of weeks at the point that we're recording

980
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,360
 but it will probably it may well have gone down by the time we record again so we're

981
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,440
 telling you to watch it now.

982
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,720
 It's great for just watching you can put it on your telly and you can watch it you can

983
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,720
 listen to program items while you're doing other things.

984
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,640
 I have now seen more EasterCon program than at any EasterCon for decades because I've

985
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,680
 picked it all up on catch up and I've seen about seven or eight items now.

986
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,120
 It's been absolutely great really loving it.

987
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:41,200
 It's interesting that the program item I have enjoyed most so far has been a purely fandom

988
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,880
 based one where it was at some point in the panel somebody from the audience explained

989
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,240
 that it was more a comment than a question sort of a panel and indeed these are the program

990
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,800
 items I've always liked.

991
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,800
 I don't think they should be on at 10.30 in the morning.

992
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,800
 I think they should be on later in the day and I wish we had a lot more of that sort of

993
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,280
 thing and a lot less of boring panels.

994
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,800
 I have to say I've seen a couple of those two.

995
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:09,320
 I've also seen a couple where what was described by Carrie in Moose as every panel has to have

996
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,280
 one elderly white man who doesn't know very much about the topic pontificating and I've

997
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,440
 seen a couple of those.

998
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,200
 If you're that man, stop volunteering for program and if you're the program people,

999
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,040
 stop putting about all those program items.

1000
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,240
 I mean that's a separate conversation as to how you do that so we'll save that for another

1001
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,240
 time.

1002
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1003
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,240
 Anyway, what could catch up if you've seen off the EasterCon that I was so involved in

1004
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,720
 creating and have been working on for two years with this catch up in mind as one of the

1005
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,720
 things we were going to do?

1006
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,720
 Well, I haven't watched any of it.

1007
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,480
 I'm very bad at watching stuff on catch up because like, well, there's a bunch of other

1008
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,280
 stuff I could be doing now I'm home from EasterCon.

1009
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,880
 But you do go to the program at the convention when I'm in the bar with my friends because

1010
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,120
 I go I could watch catch up any time but I could only be in the bar with my friends right

1011
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,120
 now.

1012
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,440
 Whereas I enjoy watching program, you know, I enjoy watching program at the time but I

1013
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,440
 think I don't enjoy it quite as much when I'm home and there's a bunch of other stuff

1014
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,480
 I've been catching up on.

1015
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:11,560
 My favorite program item is one of the ones about science fiction that Alison thinks should

1016
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:17,240
 be removed in favor of fandom items which was Desert Island Books with Neil Harrison and

1017
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,240
 Dan Hartland which was fascinating.

1018
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,760
 Oh, you see, I would have said that was a fan item.

1019
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,200
 Can't just define them as fan items because you want to define them as fan items.

1020
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:35,200
 No, it's a fan item because it's actually a biographical item about a fan told through

1021
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,920
 the medium of favorite books.

1022
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:43,400
 I see I disagree with that because I would argue that most of the things Neil was on highlighted

1023
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:49,320
 his critic side, not his fan side and certainly I enjoyed the third row panel to which you

1024
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,880
 referred earlier.

1025
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,240
 I was on it but I did have fun being on it but Desert Island Books was really fascinating

1026
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:02,360
 as an examination of why Neil does his criticism, how he does it and how his experiences have

1027
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,640
 shaped that.

1028
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:08,920
 It was an extremely good guest of honor item and it's a little bit of shame that they had

1029
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,760
 some technical difficulties because it was very early in the con but it is great.

1030
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,600
 I really recommend that.

1031
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,880
 Very, very good item.

1032
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:22,240
 Yes, the one I'm most looking forward to watching that I haven't yet got to is the one about

1033
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:27,920
 overshoots which I have not seen yet but I am looking forward to watching.

1034
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,640
 So I did really like a straight scientific talk.

1035
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:38,120
 This is one of the hybrid things that you can do which is Dana Staffs, the lady in the octopus.

1036
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,360
 One of the great things about hybrid conventions is that you can bring in experts from all over

1037
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:46,480
 the world and have them do their thing on Zoom and then into the thing and get, but nevertheless

1038
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,640
 get interaction from the audience and from Discord and that talk was fantastic.

1039
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,440
 I'm sure there are other fantastic scientific talks but I really, really like that one and

1040
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,440
 would recommend it too.

1041
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,640
 Which was about Jean-Vieux Poure power who invented the modern aquarium.

1042
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,800
 Oh interesting.

1043
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,600
 So fantastic talk.

1044
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,840
 And also a shameless plug.

1045
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:12,280
 I did an interview with Adrian Tricowski and I had a whale of a time and I think everyone

1046
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,800
 should go watch it because he's just great.

1047
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:20,480
