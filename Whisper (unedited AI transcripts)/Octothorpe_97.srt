1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 Um, oh hang on, is there a live letter of comment?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,920
 I already did that one, cool.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,760
 Is a, is a live letter of comment just a spanner sharing at you from the other room?

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,920
 In this case texting.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,760
 [Laughs]

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:25,280
 [Music]

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:32,400
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 97th episode of Oct.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,760
 Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,200
 which is coming to you on the 23rd of November, 2023.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,560
 I'm John Coxon.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,440
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,560
 And today we have heard from some people about some things.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,840
 Who?

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,200
 Who did we hear from John?

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,760
 We heard from Lee Edmonds who wrote about historical sources vis-a-vis NASFIC.

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,120
 Lee tells us that we can blame the NASFIC on Australia.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,880
 So there we have it.

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,880
 And then, leaded some more research and said, "No, you can't."

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
 It's more complicated than that.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
 And basically goes into a lot of detail.

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,640
 So when the Wussfiz Constitution was first amended,

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,880
 so it used to be that the Wussfiz Constitution was split into

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,760
 split the US into zones.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,880
 So the Worldcon couldn't be held in the same zone of the US twice in a row, basically.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,000
 And this has been superseded by something in the Wussfiz Constitution

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
 that means you can't hold it within.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,160
 I think it's 500 miles of the city at which site selection is conducted,

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,080
 which is an attempt to prevent it just staying in the same place every other year.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,760
 And goes into a lot of detail about how the NASFIC was added

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,480
 as part of a lot of stuff to do with overhauling that.

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,600
 So the NASFIC came into being when Wussfiz moved away from that mechanism

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,320
 to force the convention to travel.

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,400
 And his Spaniard told me, and I did not know this,

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,160
 that Westercon started originally because the people who went to the first Westercon

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,960
 were so annoyed that the Worldcon was always on the East Coast.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,680
 And so they started Westercon to be on the West Coast.

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
 I might just paste this somewhere and link to it from the show notes,

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,720
 because it's very interesting.

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,800
 Yes, thank you for your research, Lee.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,080
 I think you do deserve a quiet lie down after trying to work out

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,640
 what was going on with the NASFIC and Worldcon constitutions in 1970.

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,200
 This is what Lee lives for these days, research into incredibly

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,280
 obstruscent complicated things.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,960
 I have one of his books for a fanfunds auction,

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,720
 which is all about the history of a company that made bacon.

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,040
 I realise I'm at risk here of a deluge of emails,

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,280
 but if anyone else wants to research obscure,

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,160
 fanist history topics and then email us about them,

49
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,120
 I like reading them.

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
 I can't go and too will read them all out,

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
 depending on how long your letters get.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
 No, yes, thank you very much again.

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,680
 That was very good.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,480
 We also heard from Ispania, who asked on Mastodon

55
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,120
 whether there would be a photograph of us in purple octthorpshirts

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
 in a purple premier in room at Glasgow.

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,800
 There might be, except I don't have an octathorpshirts,

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
 but I have purple Glasgow shirt.

59
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
 No, it would have to be an octathorpshirts.

60
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,440
 I may skip out of the premier in at the point where Glasgow launches

61
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,880
 its actual room rates, right?

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,800
 You might.

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,440
 I might, but I might not, depends on the room rates.

64
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,960
 My premier in booking is cancelable,

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,680
 and the intention was always to slip into a Glasgow room if those looked like they were better.

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,840
 So in the perfectly public programme item at Novicon,

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,480
 where Esther updated everyone on Glasgow things,

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,440
 she said quite a lot of rooms at between 150 and 180 pounds a night,

69
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,160
 but not all, obviously quite a lot of more than that as well.

70
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,120
 Like the lower end of that is still starting above what I'm paying for premier in if I'm in it.

71
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
 So yeah, andals, but also it'll include breakfast.

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960
 So maybe include breakfast.

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,720
 We'll see. Anyway, all of this is wild speculation at the moment.

74
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,080
 January is the date we have for room bookings.

75
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,680
 I mean, the other problem is that fans have wildly bid up the premier in

76
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,800
 room pricing by all booking a year out, and then if we all cancel it,

77
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
 the price won't come back down.

78
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,360
 We also heard from Christopher J. Garcia.

79
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
 He said Taff was the first time fandom changed his life,

80
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,360
 and that's only happened twice.

81
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
 I think Chris is trying to get us to ask what the other time was,

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
 but I refuse Chris, I refuse.

83
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,160
 Chris, what was the other time?

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
 Do write in and tell us?

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,080
 You panda to him, you spoil him.

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,320
 Yeah, well, it's 2023, so that's fiction year of the panda, isn't it?

87
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,440
 Laurie Anderson on Facebook appreciated your hanger jokes.

88
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,600
 Laurie Anderson on Facebook is a person of impeccable taste and judgement,

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,920
 who went into detail on street addresses.

90
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,600
 Do you want to tackle that, Liz?

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
 Yes, in a minute when I get up.

92
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,360
 Yes.

93
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
 Laurie, yes, said me again, maybe I should have sent an email.

94
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,880
 We accept emails, Facebook comments,

95
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,640
 Macedon messages, Twitter messages.

96
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,600
 We might just occasionally miss them and not realise for six months.

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,040
 Laurie would interpret postal address to mean mailing address,

98
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,320
 as distinct from residential street address,

99
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,720
 which I think is just confusing things more,

100
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,200
 because now we've got mailing address, residential address,

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,480
 street address and postal address,

102
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,840
 and they could all reasonably be interpreted different ways

103
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,880
 by a different set of people in a different country.

104
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,440
 She does say that she hopes postal address does not end up being defined

105
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,000
 as residential address, because it will endanger those people

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 who use a PO books for safety reasons, which is a good answer.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,840
 My brain is working at like 50% capacity, so I cannot say residential address.

108
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,480
 So yeah, the agenda for the business meeting,

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,360
 I think the one that won was the one that dictated postal address,

110
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
 but it says postal specifically.

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,560
 So I would agree that Laurie's interpretation was probably correct,

112
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,400
 but like, I don't know, it annoyingly vague.

113
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,920
 She also says that we should take a shot every time someone says pro-keal

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,600
 and then go directly to hospital.

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,680
 That was it, that was all the letters of comment.

116
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
 Ooh!

117
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,680
 Yeah, if you have any comments, please write in.

118
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,640
 But what do you Chengdu News? Chengdu's!

119
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,040
 How have we got this far without that joke?

120
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,120
 I think Liz wanted to discuss this, so would you care to introduce it Liz?

121
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,640
 Yeah, now I have to be coherent for 30 seconds.

122
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,280
 Okay, so Chengdu further follow up.

123
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,480
 It seems like more con reports are coming out,

124
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,360
 especially ones from the Chinese attendees who I admit

125
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,680
 I've been reading these reports only through Google Translate,

126
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,280
 so I'm going to get the gist but not specific nuances.

127
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,680
 But it does seem like there's been a bit of a divide in the experience

128
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,400
 between maybe the foreign fans who were looked after very well

129
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,840
 and the Chinese fans who do not seem to have got such a good deal out of it.

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,720
 And we'll link to one of the issues reports in the show notes,

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,680
 but there seem to be a lot of things with foreign attendees

132
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,360
 generally being in the closest hotel, the hotel price for that hotel being extremely high.

133
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,200
 Anyone who voted at DISCOM would have already had a full attending membership,

134
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,160
 whereas it seems it was quite hard to buy memberships and some of them sold out.

135
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,440
 Issues with people volunteering and then not actually hearing anything

136
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,200
 back about their volunteering offers,

137
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,400
 although that is not going to be exclusively a Chengdu problem,

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,960
 that is a problem of all conventions I think,

139
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,520
 especially World Cons, things through the cracks.

140
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,280
 But it does seem like the attendees came back and kind of said,

141
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
 "Wow, this was great!"

142
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
 I think a lot of them had a handler to help them get around,

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,440
 to help them with issues with translation and things like that,

144
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,320
 and they were in a close buy hotel, and it was kind of easy to deal with,

145
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,680
 and then some of the attendees not having such a good time.

146
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,160
 So I think it's going to be interesting to see maybe in a year from now or six months from now,

147
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,440
 when everything is settled down, how people feel it went,

148
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,120
 and whether Chinese fandom thinks this was good, we want to do it again,

149
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,200
 or do they think this was not good, we want to do it again and do it better,

150
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,080
 or do they think, "No, that was it, we've had a WILK on now, we're done."

151
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,560
 - Hmm, yeah, no, it will be interesting.

152
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,800
 - I think when we listen to some of the things that Chinese fans are saying about it,

153
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,440
 they are giving the impression that it kind of all got taken away from them.

154
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,560
 So something that they felt started as a fan generated idea,

155
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,960
 became something very, very different to the end.

156
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,440
 Certainly a lot more money was spent on the WILK on

157
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,600
 than could be accounted for by the admission fees.

158
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,960
 - Weirdly, I keep getting invited to physics conferences in Chengdu at the moment.

159
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,160
 I don't know why.

160
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,080
 - Mm-hmm, same basic deal is it.

161
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,400
 Somebody's paying for all of the costs of the physics conference,

162
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,480
 and presumably, maybe Chengdu University just has a lot of money.

163
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,000
 - Oh yeah, I'm sure it's completely above board, etc.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
 It is interesting to see the reports coming out.

165
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,520
 I'm glad that everyone who had a good time had a good time,

166
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,600
 and I hope it was a net good for Chinese fandom, but we shall see.

167
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,280
 - I want to say I like living in the future because I like the fact that I can understand

168
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,480
 nearly all of a Chinese report on the WILK on by putting it into Google Translate.

169
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,520
 And even a couple of years ago, that wouldn't have been the case.

170
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,920
 Things are moving very fast in those automatic translation and automatic transcribing spaces.

171
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,160
 - Yes, getting all of this stuff translated would be non-trivial.

172
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,480
 - Well, it's so good that when there's a word that's been translated wrong,

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,160
 it was like, I think the astounding award got translated by Google as the surprise award.

174
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,840
 And the translation is so good that when something like that happens,

175
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,200
 I realize I've forgotten I'm reading it in Google Translate until I notice something

176
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,720
 that's obviously wrong.

177
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,520
 And I go, "Oh right, remember, the whole thing is in Google Translate so you are losing nuance."

178
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,480
 I think that's just a very, I think there's a lot more you're losing, a lot more nuance.

179
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
 I think that's just the very obvious thing that pops up there.

180
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,080
 Because you're going to miss things, like there's incredibly subtle things in language

181
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,800
 that we're not getting in, especially here where they're criticizing a lot of the stuff that happens.

182
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
 I don't know how harsh some of this criticism is.

183
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,560
 I don't know how much I should think this is in an angry tone or a fairly resigned to it tone.

184
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,000
 Like there's all that sort of thing that I would be picking up if I was reading this in English

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
 that I'm missing.

186
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,920
 So factual stuff is good, but I can't really get too much about how the author feels.

187
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
 It seems like the author feels pretty angry about it, but I don't know if that's just because that's

188
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,200
 how it's been translated, like words like irresponsible and things like that.

189
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
 I think there's a lot of like potential ways to translate that.

190
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,040
 We might be getting off topic into translation, but I think there's that.

191
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,560
 And also when I read things by different authors that have been put through Google Translate,

192
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,520
 I'm not sure I could tell you major differences between the writing styles, which I could if they

193
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,280
 were languages I could read.

194
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,960
 There's two things. I've got two things and then we'll move on to more on topic things,

195
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,640
 which is firstly, obviously it's very difficult to compare a Google translation into English

196
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
 versus reading it in the original language if you don't speak the original language, right?

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,800
 So like I speak a little bit of Spanish, so I have like a vague idea of this,

198
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,560
 but like not anywhere near enough to comment qualifiably.

199
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,560
 But second comment, obviously this is why God gave us emoji,

200
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,360
 because if you use emoji, they won't need translating and you'll understand exactly how

201
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,200
 angry someone is. So just use normal, nice, basic words and have loads of emoji.

202
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,000
 That has the future of language people you heard it here first.

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
 Winky face.

204
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,000
 Shitty Tingrin emoji.

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,240
 Can that be the episode title? Perhaps not.

206
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,640
 And obviously there's still no stats. One day there will be stats.

207
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,600
 Stats, stats, stats.

208
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,800
 We've been told we'll have stats by the latest day in which Chengdu is not in violation of its

209
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,680
 responsibilities under the Wistles Constitution.

210
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,600
 Did I see and Liz might, one of you might have been on the discord.

211
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,120
 I'm sure some posted link which is like has it been 90 days since Chengdu yet or something like that?

212
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
 It might have been a dream.

213
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,040
 Maybe for Christmas Santa will bring us stats.

214
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:49,040
 I'm also going to point out like if Chengdu missed the deadline for publishing the Hugo stats,

215
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,960
 what's going to happen?

216
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,240
 Nothing would happen.

217
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,800
 Exactly.

218
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,040
 On the topic of Chengdu, the Wistles first minutes aren't out yet, but there have been

219
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,240
 reports and there are videos of what went on.

220
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,720
 So we're going to discuss that all a little bit here.

221
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
 And to do that we'll need

222
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,160
 Liz bat to the Batmobile, Liz bat.

223
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,880
 What they've now published on the Wistles first site is the updated Constitution and

224
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:28,880
 Standing Rules which basically means it includes everything that was ratified or was a rule

225
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,760
 change that didn't need ratification that took effect in 2023.

226
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,760
 So you can now look at the new Constitution if you want because they highlight the changes.

227
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,800
 So the changes are pretty minimal in the actual Constitution which is to include

228
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,360
 best game and interactive work and a definition of game or interactive work and also to remove

229
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,240
 the rule by which no award is given if it's less than 25% of the total number of award ballots in any

230
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,880
 category.

231
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,600
 So those I think we agree are both great changes.

232
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,800
 Good to see them.

233
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,880
 Hooray, but they also amended the standing rules which are kind of the rules by which

234
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
 the governance of the business meeting takes place.

235
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
 And there's now an extra one at the end.

236
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,920
 Rule 7.9 proxy and remote voting only Wistles members physically present at the business

237
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,320
 meeting shall be recognized for purpose is to debate or may move second or vote on motions

238
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,960
 on the floor of the meeting proxy voting is not permitted.

239
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 So this was not in the agenda that was on the website and when I went and looked at the

240
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,600
 recording of the preliminary meeting and I've got to thank Kevin Stanley for putting up

241
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,080
 and making the recordings of the business meetings at Chengdu so we can even go and look at this.

242
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,120
 It basically comes up very, very late that there was a super late change the standing rules to put

243
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,000
 this in.

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,280
 It was felt that it kind of formalizes the current practice of business meetings not to

245
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,040
 allow any proxy or remote voting and so it kind of was thought to be just kind of an

246
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,600
 explanatory change to the rules and so it could pass in one year.

247
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,680
 Yes, by six votes to four.

248
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,960
 Yeah, so I think so basically this was done, this was brought by Dave McCarthy and

249
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:20,640
 waved through by the 10 people in the room because as it stood this was not ruled against or four

250
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,560
 in the standing rules and so it does seem a little bit crappy that Dave did this.

251
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,680
 I think it acts to preserve the status quo and preserve the privilege of the people in the room

252
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,160
 without much thought for what might be good for the community going forward and yeah,

253
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,240
 I just I was a little bit sad to see this happen and I don't think it reflects well on any of the

254
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,600
 people who enabled it.

255
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
 It's my basic take.

256
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,360
 So Kevin Stanley is posted to say, oh no, it's not like that.

257
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,640
 Where something's not covered in your standing rules, you kind of go to the generic Roberts

258
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,680
 Rules of Order to see what you should be doing and the generic Roberts Rules of Order say no

259
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,520
 proxies or remote participation unless you already have provision for it in your organizing documents.

260
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,680
 So therefore it is his argument is this is a clarification because we didn't have anything

261
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,240
 and so so it actually was automatically part of the rules because we were using Roberts Rules of

262
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,800
 Order.

263
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,600
 Let me go back to saying Roberts Rules of Order is completely unfit for purpose for parliamentary

264
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,800
 work in the 21st century or even the 20th.

265
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,600
 It was getting out of hand by the end of the 19th.

266
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,520
 We should have a better parliamentary system.

267
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,520
 I understand that that might never happen because it's quite a complicated thing to sort out but

268
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,080
 still.

269
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,960
 But that's the issue is that apparently Roberts Rules already has this provision in it.

270
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,320
 So by not having the thing in a standing order, it doesn't mean, oh, you can do online participation

271
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,200
 if you like.

272
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,240
 It means, oh, you should go back and use whatever Roberts Rules says generically.

273
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,200
 I do think this was pretty underhand anyway.

274
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,800
 If you were going to do this, you would probably want to let people know in advance you were

275
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,000
 going to do it.

276
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,400
 I feel like six votes to four.

277
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,840
 The quorum for the Worcester Business Meeting is more than that though, of course, presumably

278
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,520
 some people abstained in this vote.

279
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,040
 Yeah, I mean what I'd say is if it's already, so if this is already just making explicit

280
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,080
 something that we think was covered already by the rules, then I don't know why there was

281
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,320
 need to put it in as like a super last minute thing that wasn't on the public agenda.

282
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,680
 Because if it's not on the public agenda and people don't know it's happening,

283
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,960
 then they might think, well, actually, I don't need to go to the preliminary business meeting,

284
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:50,320
 which is mostly about setting times for debate and doing objections to things that we don't

285
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
 want to debate.

286
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,360
 You might skip that and think you'll turn up on the next morning for the main business

287
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,480
 meeting and you've actually maybe missed an important bit of business.

288
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,080
 Well, and the answer to your question of why would you do it like this is duplicity.

289
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,000
 Simply put, I think, like, you know, I don't want to be too mean, but yeah, it just leaves

290
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,360
 a bad taste in the mouth.

291
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,280
 Or propose a rule change.

292
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,160
 Yeah.

293
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,680
 Glasgow.

294
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,640
 Why not?

295
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,360
 You want to spend all of Glasgow in the business meeting, right, John?

296
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:26,000
 Do we want to talk about independent film?

297
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,600
 Yeah, I want to talk about independent film because the reason I'm not going to be

298
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,840
 introducing a new amendment on remote participation, though, obviously, I'll enthusiastically support

299
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:43,040
 anybody who does, is I'm going to be busy trying to kill a pair of new hughos for long-form

300
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,320
 and short-form independent film, which have been half ratified with zero attention or care

301
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,480
 directly due to the fact that the World Cod does not have online participation of voting,

302
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,440
 because if it did do, it wouldn't have passed because the usual suspects would have stopped it

303
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,400
 from doing so.

304
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
 Are you sure?

305
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,560
 Because if you're in, I'm just saying, if you could even out participation, not only would

306
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,480
 maybe the usual suspects of remote participation in, but maybe loads and loads of other people,

307
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,480
 maybe loads of Chinese people in the program?

308
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,720
 So last episode, we speculated that maybe some of these amendments and whatnots that were

309
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,960
 made and need ratification at Glasgow had been made by Chinese fans who were just like,

310
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
 you know, I get to be in the meeting and I get to propose a thing for a thing I like

311
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,520
 and it gets it in the conversation and hurrah.

312
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,880
 And I was like, "Oh, that is actually a fair thing to say and it's a good thing and we don't

313
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,440
 want to just be three Westerners opposing, you know, what Chinese fans want from a nominally

314
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,720
 world organisation."

315
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,360
 But it turns out the person who is trying to get these independent film hughos through

316
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:57,120
 is Louis Avi, who runs sci-fi London, which the astute listener may notice London is not in China.

317
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,560
 And so this does not look like it is a grassroots, enthusiastic Chinese thing.

318
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,280
 It looks rather more like it's someone with an interest in independent film trying to force

319
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,680
 through a hugho on independent film without really engaging with the community first,

320
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,800
 which suddenly recasts it from me thinking, "Oh, well, it's kind of adorable, but I don't think

321
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,160
 it will work." And I go from that basic opinion to, "This is what the sad puppies were trying to do,

322
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,400
 and I oppose it extremely vehemently."

323
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,800
 So it has completely recontextualised my thoughts on this with one screenshot of a

324
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,080
 Facebook post, which is really interesting. What do we think?

325
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,520
 Previously on this podcast, we may have suggested that Louis Savi was a generally good egg and

326
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,400
 that we were big fans of the London Sci-Fi Film Festival. We just wanted you to know that we have

327
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,080
 now changed our minds and he's confirmed rota. No, we have not changed our minds. You have changed

328
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,040
 your minds. So yeah, no attributing opinions to me that I do not personally have.

329
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,640
 I don't think he's a rota, but I am deeply uncomfortable with it.

330
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,520
 So all I would say is we've seen a post from Louis Savi on the Glasgow Facebook group saying he

331
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,680
 was hoping to come to Glasgow and help push through the ratification of these things.

332
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,560
 What we don't know, and I think we're speculating quite a lot, is whether the people who proposed

333
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,960
 in China were actually supportive independent film in China or whether they were just people he

334
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,680
 had found to kind of propose it. We don't know to what extent there is a grassroots movement or

335
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,000
 rather not a grassroots movement, but maybe just a big movement of independent film in China,

336
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,120
 which possibly Louis is well aware of because he's really deeply into independent film.

337
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,520
 And also I think it's better fair to say he's coming in from outside. I mean, he ran the film

338
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,200
 program in 2014. He's not a complete outsider to the community. Okay. Yeah, no, that's fair.

339
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,880
 And you know, they had the Clark Awards at sci-fi London for a long time as well.

340
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,520
 Yeah, I don't think he's a rota. I think these are very badly founded hugos, and this is a real

341
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,000
 problem if they were to pass next year. I think there is a differentiation. I guess it depends

342
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,960
 which community you're talking about, right? Because I'm very much specifically talking about

343
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,680
 the WorldCon community. I had not appreciated he was involved with programme for LondonCon,

344
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,160
 but I don't know that I think having the clerks at sci-fi London means you're part of the World

345
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,600
Con community because I think the clerks and WorldCon are separate things that are interlinked.

346
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,920
 And in my defence, he does say in the post he proposed the Hugo Awards. So I am assuming,

347
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,320
 therefore, that he proposed to them. But if he did not, then that is an error and I regret it.

348
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,120
 But he must have had some people helping out to get them passed. So, but this is one of the

349
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,840
 reasons we the minutes, I suppose. We may need to listen to more video as well that we haven't

350
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,320
 listened to yet. Yeah, but it just, it slightly frustrates me because the other thing is

351
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,720
 that if this was something that he had felt, there's an optic to this, which is choosing to do it in

352
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,800
 China when you know that there won't be many people at the business meeting and you know the

353
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:56,560
 next meeting will be in your home territory, does not feel like it wasn't a considered decision to

354
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,000
 make it more likely that this would get through. And maybe that is me putting a lot of negative

355
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,960
 like assumptions on him, but the optics of it are not great. I think that's definitely how it can

356
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,200
 be observed whether it was the intention or not. Because if you know the business meeting, you know,

357
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,280
 the Chinese, the Chengdui one was going to be sparsely attended and probably easier to pass

358
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,920
 stuff at. And that's going to be the impression people get, even if you didn't actually know that

359
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,160
 you just knew that there were independent film fans in China who might be amenable to

360
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:32,000
 helping with this proposal. Okay, having said that clearly savvy is a rata, how about taking

361
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,600
 that the other way around and going, oh no, if I want to do this, I want to have the ratification

362
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,440
 discussions at Glasgow, because it's in the UK and Chengdu just happens to be the year before.

363
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,760
 Why don't know? I still think it's weird that you'd think about it in terms of the ratification

364
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,000
 discussion. I think that's what's the red flag for me. Because yeah, look at best game

365
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,760
 ratification. The substantial discussion happened the year it passed, not the year it got ratified,

366
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,160
 although because the ratification was in Chengdui. But you know, normally you were seeing substantial

367
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,920
 discussion happen before something gets on there, not things not being ratified. So it will be a

368
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,200
 bit of a difference to the usual procedure. Yeah, it will. It would be terrible if these passed.

369
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,440
 It will be interesting to see, in fact, Glasgow, you know, a few people turn up who quite like this

370
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,400
 Hugo and it's resoundingly defeated. That makes it look a lot less problematic than it does if

371
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,640
 sort of 50 independent filmmakers turn up an all enthusiastic leave out to ratfly.

372
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,000
 So it'll be interesting to see what happens. I'm going to reserve judgment, but it definitely

373
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,720
 feels a bit hinky in a way that I don't enjoy. And maybe I'm just like on edge after the last

374
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,200
 kind of stuff that's happened in the last 10 years with the Hugo's. I don't know, I'm a bit wary of

375
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,200
 people trying to change things through fiat rather than through community involvement.

376
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,240
 Well, hopefully there'll be a year of discussion about it and the best outcome will be if

377
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,600
 then that comes up with a list of really good independent short films to watch.

378
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,560
 I mean, I'm also just aware that we're basically never going to get rid of any Hugo category ever.

379
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,840
 So I don't want to just keep adding them at the rate of two or three year.

380
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:17,280
 The problem is that the Hugo categories until now have always subdivided Hugo content. So that

381
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,800
 was the reason we had that huge argument about the young adult Hugo that became load style.

382
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,720
 So these don't, these are extra Hugo's for things that are already winning Hugo's.

383
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,080
 I mean, Tamsa Muir could have won two Hugo's this year. I know they're not for exactly the

384
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,360
 same thing, but one would be a subset of the other. Okay, so don't make me hate best series again.

385
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,560
 I mean, I'm certainly up for having best novel have a provision that is best novel,

386
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,440
 open brackets, not part of a longer series, close brackets. And if you ever write a sequel,

387
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
 we come and take your Hugo away.

388
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:59,840
 Break into their house. I presume that this is also a problem with novel because

389
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:06,000
 so although Flowers for Algon and didn't win the Hugo in his novel form, it did win the

390
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,280
 nebula after having won the Hugo for its short story form. And so it is already true that

391
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:19,920
 if you write a short story, Hugo just did the episode about the Danny novella, which is basically

392
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,040
 just the Danny chapters of Game of Thrones published as a novella before it came out.

393
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,160
 I presume that would have been eligible as a novella and then Game of Thrones would have been

394
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,000
 eligible in novel. So I think part of the problem here is that it's very difficult in the

395
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:42,400
 because obviously short story through to series all are basically rewarding text storytelling.

396
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,320
 Like, you know, you can rework those things in various ways that might mean you end up being

397
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:53,680
 eligible more than once for similar work. Yeah, but the independent films are for the same thing.

398
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:00,000
 They are eligible in both categories. You wouldn't want everything everywhere to win

399
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,080
 two Hugo's in the same year for exactly the same. I mean, maybe you would,

400
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,080
 because lots of people liked it, but like, I would like it to.

401
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,720
 But I mean, the everything everywhere problem expresses the main problem here, which is

402
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,960
 what counts as independent, what's an independent film, what's an independent brewery.

403
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,440
 What will happen with this, even if you had it almost certainly is that for the long form,

404
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,360
 certainly you'd get the most widely, it would be an award for most widely distributed independent

405
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,320
 film, which is not necessarily what you want. Yeah, I don't know because we don't have the

406
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,920
 minutes yet. I don't know what the definition of independent is. I think it was probably on the

407
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,600
 agenda, but I don't know whether it got changed in the room. But I think in general, I don't love it

408
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:53,440
 when an attempt to add a Hugo is coming from someone who is directly involved with enterprises

409
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,120
 that make money from the thing they are trying to get a Hugo in for. And so I would actually mind

410
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,200
 much less again if it was someone who just really liked independent film and didn't run

411
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,040
 an independent film festival, because I do understand that that probably means you have a lot of

412
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,840
 affection for the form, but it also means it gets hard for me to disentangle the less noble

413
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,960
 incentives from the more noble ones, if that makes sense. But that might be unfair, I don't know.

414
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:28,560
 It reminds me of the push for a Hugo for Best Audio book, which was suggested by a paid-up

415
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,080
 member of the audio book publishing industry. Yeah. Sorry, I've got very distracted trying to

416
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,520
 work out if I'm a Caffrey managed to win a Hugo for the same thing twice. Oh, good knowledge.

417
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,960
 No, is the answer. Listeners, if you can think of any instance where someone did win a Hugo for

418
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,080
 the same thing twice right in. Martha Wells. I mean, Lois McMaster-Boudjold, if we go in that

419
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,200
 route, but that's not quite what I meant. Okay, sorry, no, I finished checking and she didn't.

420
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,920
 It's because she won for Novella, which became the first half of a novel, but that novel was not

421
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:10,480
 nominated for Hugo. The sequel to it was nominated for Hugo. So I think we're good. That was a nice

422
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,560
 D-rail, wasn't it? Sorry. Lovely. I still don't think that winning a Hugo for Best Series is the

423
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,560
 same as winning a Hugo for something that's component part of Best Series, but by C-Darguant.

424
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:29,280
 But that isn't that exactly the same novel argument as if you win a Hugo for a Novella that then becomes

425
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,080
 part of your Hugo winning novel. I don't also don't really have a problem with that. Yeah, okay.

426
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,080
 The argument I'm in fact making is I think it's not like Flowers from Algonon wouldn't have deserved

427
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,000
 the Hugo for its novel form if people thought it was the best novel that year despite the fact

428
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 that I had previously won for short story. It is sort of exactly my point really.

429
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,840
 Glasgow have a press release. They have announced their online attendance plan. Their online convention

430
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,400
 experience is going to do lots of things which are great. It is going to be based on hopping events

431
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:14,800
 from Ring Central for video streaming and Discord for text interaction and community forums and

432
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:21,520
 all adult and younger adult attending members will automatically receive full access or you can buy

433
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,320
 a online attending ticket for £35 which will give you full access to the online experience.

434
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,400
 I mean or you could buy an online attending membership which also includes Wussfuss membership

435
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:37,280
 for £75. So yes. Yeah, and there's a discount for existing Wussfuss members to update to online.

436
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:44,640
 And hopping events, their streaming platform is Streamyard which people who came to punctuation

437
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,040
 remember. Oh yeah, it works. I like it. So we're trailblazers. They're much bigger now and they do

438
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:58,240
 much more things but that's Streamyard at its heart. That is fair. Yeah, I think Streamyard

439
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,200
 seemed quite straightforward for participants to get the hang of. We've got to say and you can have

440
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,120
 like someone in there secretly, you know, putting the spotlight on different people and muting

441
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,520
 things and turning things on and off and putting a presentation up which means you don't end up

442
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,400
 with the kind of 10 minutes of, oh, can you see my screen? Oh, I'll just turn it on and off the

443
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,480
 screen sharing. Oh, can you see my screen? Oh, it's in presenter view. Oh yeah.

444
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,680
 Yeah, but Liz, stop talking about the beginning of this podcast and let's get back to discussing

445
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,760
 Glasgow. Yes, I misread the press release but yes, you can, if you're an existing WISFS member,

446
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,240
 you can upgrade to an online attending member for cheap. So that's good and it will be lovely.

447
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,880
 You know, I think it should be lovely. I have huge faith in the people who are doing tech for

448
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,600
 Worldcon and I think they're going to do a good job. I'm glad that they're using a platform I

449
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,680
 have some familiarity with and I'm also glad that they decided that Discord was the way to do

450
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,440
 text chat and that that was a useful thing to do because I think

451
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,520
 Discords have been great for conventions over the last couple of years and I want them for all

452
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,160
 conventions really. Yeah, don't make me learn another platform now. I'm too old. I'm stuck now.

453
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,080
 I'm never going to progress best Discord. But they are suggesting that they're going to do some

454
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,320
 virtual events in the new year so that we can all get used to the platform well in advance of the

455
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,960
 convention. So that sounds exciting too. So hopefully by the time the convention comes around, we'll

456
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,320
 all have used the virtual stuff and have found out how it works. Yes. And as a result of that,

457
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,920
 the last Glasgow Presents events, we mentioned Glasgow Presents a few weeks ago, was last night.

458
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:42,560
 Alison hosted it listeners. I hosted it. Yes, I was moderating Peter Espiegel and Catherine

459
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:48,960
 M. Valente in conversation. Ooh. I don't think your name was on the poster. I don't think your

460
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:56,240
 name is on the poster in big letters next to Peter Espiegel. For some reason, for some reason my

461
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,480
 day was not on the poster, but I was the person managing the questions and lots of people came

462
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,920
 along to the event bright and lots of people watched on YouTube and it was just great. Thank

463
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,880
 you everyone to Cucame and it's interesting if you're interested in Beagle and I know you probably

464
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,080
 have to be a person of a certain age. There were a lot of people of a certain age in the audience,

465
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,160
 I'd say, who were very inspired by Beagle's work when they were kids. But also, Kat Valente

466
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,680
 writes Middle Grade, I think. So she's going to have a very different following. And the thing

467
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:34,800
 starts with a me cute about how Kat Valente met Peter Beagle. So, which is well worth listening to.

468
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,560
 Do we want to do NovaCon? I've got a tiny touch, I just want to say, I went to NovaCon,

469
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,760
 neither of you came to NovaCon. Somebody bounded up to me and said, "When is Octa thought live with

470
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:01,440
 Stunt John and Stunt Liz?" I was like, "Oh, you're drinking with it right now." You should have,

471
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,520
 you should have a pint glass that says Octa thought live on it. So whenever you're at a

472
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:11,440
 convention on your own, you can just be, you can have Octa thought live. No, I was not in NovaCon,

473
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,560
 I was somewhere else. Where was I? Oh, I was cottaging. We had quite nice weather, so

474
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,240
 Buxton was absolutely lovely. And there's a new beer bar. So it really is just like,

475
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,280
 we get up in the morning, we walk out of the hotel into this street full of lovely beer

476
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,920
 shops and drink beer all day, and then come back and then repeat. And then there's the beer tasting.

477
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,560
 And there was also the Glasgow gin tasting, which I managed to get to a short amount of.

478
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,600
 But there was phenomenal advantage in that, so I got to say I was about 50 miles from NovaCon

479
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,120
 and I didn't go. Oh, well, you guys were missing out, it was great. I nearly did, but then I had to go home.

480
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,160
 That is reasonable. Guests of honour for an Overcon 53 has been announced, and it is Alan

481
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,680
 Stroud, the chair of the BSFA. But I'm glad you had fun Alison, I'm glad you drank lots of gin.

482
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,680
 I drank lots of beer and lots of gin, I have a lovely time actually, it was good.

483
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,600
 Sorry, I didn't mean to leave out the beer and I regret the error.

484
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,520
 And lots of gossip. Way. Lots of, lots of Spanish gossip.

485
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:21,760
 Okay, so now it's time for pics. So, shall I do mine then?

486
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:29,120
 Goliath. Yes. Yes. So, I think I've actually mentioned this on the pod before. My pick this

487
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:35,840
 week is Goliath by Toki Onyubuchi, which is another of these books that people say,

488
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:44,400
 oh, this is one of the best books of 2022, but unaccountably it did not appear on award short lists.

489
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:54,320
 And so what is it? It is a book of the near future. We are in an America where most of the rich people

490
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,840
 have fucked off to space, and we have a bunch of people who are left behind on Earth.

491
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:06,720
 We learn a lot about the world, but we learn a lot about the world kind of in the sidelines of

492
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:13,760
 the book for reasons that I'm about to explain. But the people that we are mostly spending time with

493
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,240
 are kind of scraping a living together from what remains on Earth after most people have gone.

494
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,840
 So those people form the bulk of the protagonists of the book, and then we also see two

495
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:34,720
 gentrifiers. The book is called Goliath, and the gentrifiers are called David and Jonathan,

496
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,680
 and they have decided to return to Earth and make a life there because they think that it will be

497
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:50,560
 more real better, or Jonathan thinks it will be more real and better to live in the actual world

498
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,960
 with air and nature and things of that kind, and also obviously a lot of pollution and a whole lot

499
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,800
 of crime and other things going wrong. This book is difficult, and the reason that it's difficult

500
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,520
 is that it is told in a series of fragmentary scenes from lots of different points of view.

501
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:15,280
 They are differently spaced in time. You are given almost no clues as to who is narrating each

502
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,960
 section, or why, or you work it out. So in general it is a book that is much harder work

503
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,560
 than most of the books that I have read recently that are SFN Fantasy. I think probably it's a decade

504
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,520
 since I read a science fiction book that was as hard to read as this. So I kind of stopped reading

505
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,960
 it the first time and put it down. It was only because a couple of the people who think that it

506
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,680
 definitely should have been on the short lists told me to pick it up again, that I picked it up again

507
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,160
 and finished it, and I really, really enjoyed it. But like I think a lot of novels that are not

508
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,120
 science fiction novels, but very few science fiction novels, you have to work out what's going on

509
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,880
 from things that you're not necessarily told. You're expected to do some of the work to come to

510
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,440
 this and understand what is the story that you're doing told, what has actually happened here.

511
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:13,040
 I guess some people, so therefore lots of people hate it. Goodreads has got about a third, I think,

512
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,160
 people who were minded to say that they did not finish this book of the reviews on there.

513
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,440
 It's very rewarding if you keep at it. I don't think the individual parts fitter are very hard,

514
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,400
 but certainly piecing together what's going on was plenty hard enough for me. I thought what was

515
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,000
 going on was very good because I think the story it's telling is quite an important one. I couldn't

516
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,080
 help comparing it with the previous novel I'd read, which was Babel, which I really didn't like very

517
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,600
 much because Babel not only tells you everything it wants you to know, but it tells you everything

518
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,440
 it wants you to know two or three times in increasingly strident terms, especially with footnotes.

519
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,560
 And it's kind of a real palate cleanser after that because it was kind of saying no, we can write

520
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,600
 an important novel about modern America and racism and the near future and the sort of society that

521
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,360
 we might find ourselves in if we just carry on the track we're on without having to tell you

522
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,480
 everything very explicitly all of the time. So strongly recommended hard work, you know,

523
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,320
 set yourself some time to do some reading. I've not read Goliath and I have only one opinion about

524
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:30,160
 it therefore, which is, and I don't know if I've ever banged this drum on the pod, but there will

525
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,280
 be people in the audience who have heard me whine about this before, which is the title of Goliath

526
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,040
 is Goliath, colon, a novel. And I'm like, oh good, I was worried it was a kitchen sink. I do not

527
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:50,240
 understand. It would be like if Monopoly was called Monopoly a game. Yes, we know why it winds me up.

528
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,440
 Lots of games are called a game. Is it called Goliath and novel? It just said Goliath. Yes, I've just

529
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,320
 put links to it in the show note, Alison, and I bristled. Um, obviously this is not a comment on the

530
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,720
 merit of the work in terms of, um, you know, any reasonable metric. This is just a soap box that I

531
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,520
 found and decided to stand off. I think this is just on your British lawyers. He probably said,

532
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,440
 no, it's definitely called Goliath. You cannot call it anything else. The, the biblical story of

533
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,520
 Goliath is critical to the, to the reading that you'll have of this. And the lawyers will have said,

534
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,720
 but no, we need to separate it from all the other Goliath's out there. Um, how about if we call it

535
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,400
 David and Goliath? He was like, no, no, no, or, or Goliath, a story of the far future. And that'll be

536
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,640
 where they ended up. No, no, it's, it's the same as, um, so like, if you look on hive.co.uk and you

537
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,200
 type in a novel, there are so many books that have the subtitle a novel. Like Dan Morin's first book

538
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,480
 has a subtitle, a novel. And there's definitely nothing else called Caledonian Gambit. It's just,

539
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:59,360
 it's a publisher thing. I can't imagine the author caring, but yeah, it drives me up the wall. Anyway,

540
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:06,960
 publisher affectation. Yes, but I'm glad you liked it. Can I also complain then? Oh, yes, Liz, you can

541
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,320
 complain. I haven't read Goliath and I really want to read Goliath. I'm just waiting for kind of the

542
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,800
 right time to read it, which probably would have been when I could dominate the wards, but too late.

543
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,480
 Um, but what I was, no, I was, because I was going to complain about a completely different thing,

544
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,840
 which is I did try for a while having a policy of I'm not buying anything, which has got an

545
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:34,880
 incredibly long winded subtitle on Amazon to make it pop up in searches. Like, I'm never buying a

546
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:42,240
 TikTok main me buy it or the most emotional romance of 2023 from the Sunday Times bestselling author

547
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,240
 or, you know, TikTok maybe buy it the addictive and darkly romantic fantasy, but I had to give up

548
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,680
 because there are actually books I wanted to read which are all in this, the bestseller you

549
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,080
 have seen on TikTok. But just to know is me, just give me the name of the book. One other thing I

550
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,640
 remember what I did want to say about it is that it reminds me a lot of quite a lot of SF from the

551
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:07,440
 70s, which was experimental and literary in just this way. Balard, priest, those sorts of people.

552
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,680
 Oh no, I think your mistaken priest doesn't write science fiction. He just writes words.

553
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,560
 Yes. Well, he wrote a set of words called fugue for a darkling island in which the story then gets

554
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:24,560
 chopped up and reordered before you read it and Goliath is a desire to read us that.

555
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,960
 I thought I always used to think Chris Priest was being very cantankerous about these things and

556
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,840
 then I had an argument in the pub and I'm full on Chris Priest's side now. genres are a lie.

557
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,280
 Yes. So there are a lot of people going, is this book science fiction? And I mean,

558
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,080
 obviously it's science fiction, but people read it as not science fiction because it's kind of a

559
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,560
 work of the near future. And so somehow that speculative fiction of therefore literary and

560
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,000
 not science fiction at all, it's obviously science fiction guys. Or 100%. Why not? You have to

561
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,960
 you have to bear in mind that it's speculative fiction. I mean, as opposed to all of the fiction,

562
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:08,000
 which doesn't speculate, which we call nonfiction. A novel. Well, welcome to John is apparently

563
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,840
 grumpy. You do have a bit of a cup on you today, actually. I thought I was quite cheerful and happy,

564
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:21,600
 but maybe not. But we've destroyed it. Liz, do you want to talk about a book which as far as I can

565
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,480
 tell does not have the subtitle a novel. So it does not have the subtitle novel, but it does have an

566
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,960
 intriguing subtitle on Amazon last time I looked, which I would get into. So my pick of a book is

567
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:44,320
 Titanium Noir by Nick Halkaway. It is a detective novel. So it is a noir novel about a detective

568
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:50,480
 named Cal Sounder who gets called into work on particularly sensitive cases. And he gets called

569
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,600
 into a murder scene. And what is interesting about this murder scene is that the victim is

570
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:02,800
 extremely tall. And so what is going on here is that you have the titans of the title. And there

571
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,280
 is an incredibly expensive gene therapy that only the super elite can have, which, you know,

572
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,320
 resets your aging process and heals you, but also makes you taller. And so you have essentially this

573
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:22,240
 like literal race of super men and women who have taken this anti-aging technology and come out

574
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,760
 slightly taller. And these are the titans. And of course it's all about the super rich boss who

575
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,960
 invented it and has taken the titan treatment multiple times and become this kind of giant godlike

576
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,440
 man. Man rich enough that he is essentially a law unto himself, becoming like your, you know,

577
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:48,560
 Noir, my boss or whatever. And the reason that Cal investigates these murders is that his ex-girlfriend

578
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:55,040
 is the daughter of, you know, the boss of this massive empire. But why I liked it is because it's

579
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:02,480
 it's a really good noir novel. It is kind of sparky and fun and has good dialogue and people

580
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,600
 bouncing off each other and the detective goes to a bar to investigate and talks to the bouncers.

581
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:15,920
 And it just feels fun to read. It's well paced. It's got an interesting mystery, I think,

582
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:23,120
 that unravels very nicely. And I just think he's got a very good hook on the like, Noir feeling of it.

583
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,680
 And then as this science fiction thing on top, if I was going to criticise, I would say, it's

584
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,800
 it's a little bit literal. Like there are literally these people who are essentially the 1% the super

585
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,920
 rich and they have now become literally healthier and younger and taller than us. And that is

586
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,640
 a quite on the nose, not even metaphor is it? That's quite on the nose. And I don't think it does a

587
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:48,480
 huge amount with it. But it is kind of sets up this fun, you know, society of have's and have not's

588
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,440
 which is very much like our own except with this added, added twist. So yeah, I enjoyed it. And what

589
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,440
 I was going to not quite complain about is that if you look it up on Amazon, it now says titanium

590
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,280
 Noir brackets Cal sound a series, which means maybe there'll be a sequel. Then we can nominate it

591
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,360
 for best series. Hey, other Hugo Awards are available.

592
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,720
 Spoiler, did you, when you were doing your Hugo reading guys, read Ogas by Adrian Shikovsky?

593
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,560
 Yes. No, well out of time. It was very, very, very good.

594
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,320
 I mean, I thought it was pretty good. And I don't want to spoil that discussion too much.

595
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:32,640
 And España was very annoyed by the, by one of the decisions he made in terms of the language of

596
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,400
 the book. And then she was one of the things that really made her love it was that at the end,

597
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,120
 it's justified in a way that she found very satisfying. I think I've been, yeah, I'd be

598
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,080
 interested to see what you think of it as about really big people. Maybe. It's about Ogas.

599
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,880
 It's about Ogas. Oh, yeah. No, I know what the language thing that you're complaining about is now.

600
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,360
 Yes. Because I remembered, oh, yeah, no, that's something that always really irritates me. And I

601
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,760
 thought Shikovsky actually managed to pull it off. And I that was amazing. Look, I might get to it,

602
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,080
 but I've got 20, 20, through reading to be done. So I can make you all read my favorite books before

603
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:11,040
 Hugo nomination time. Okay, I'm busy. Oh, there's too many books. Oh, there's too many books there.

604
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,520
 There's another Shikovsky soon. Come on. Oh, God, the man works very hard.

605
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,960
 I've got the Tragovsky on my birthday list, obviously, because I'm non-idiot.

606
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,400
 Oh, happy birthday day, you've, by the way, we're recording this on your birthday.

607
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:30,720
 40 today. Crazy. But I am in the last bit of the year after the Hugo Award deadline. And we know

608
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,800
 what that means. It means it's time for John to read all the Star Wars and Arkham

609
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,560
 Horror tie-in novels that he didn't get to in the rest of the year. Because I've read all of the

610
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,800
 good books that people are like, you have to read this one. And now I can just read straight nonsense.

611
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,920
 That's very fun. I'm going to pick The Wicker Man, which is a movie, not the Nicholas Cage one,

612
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:57,200
 the 1973 one starring Edward Woodward, Britt Echlund, and Christopher Lee. 50th anniversary, right?

613
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,520
 It is indeed the 50th anniversary. We went to see it as part of the

614
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,360
 Whitley Bay Film Festival. And we went to see it in a village hall in a place called Earsden.

615
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:12,160
 It was great. Slight spoilers for The Wicker Man will appear as part of me telling this story.

616
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,480
 So like, but I don't think there's anything you wouldn't also have worked out from, you know,

617
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,400
 the poster or its role in modern culture. So, you know, really good, really, really good.

618
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,160
 Really enjoyed it. Really liked the way that it plays with the audience expectation in the

619
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,760
 same way it plays with the main characters expectations, like build a sense of unease.

620
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,440
 You understand what the main character is going through because you are also kind of like confused

621
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,000
 about what is happening and what I mean by that is there is a lot of nudity in this movie,

622
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,120
 like a lot. And I was a bit like, oh, I knew it was the 70s, but blind me.

623
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,720
 See 1973.

624
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,320
 So the main character is kind of a Christian fundamentalist, which is really interesting,

625
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:57,920
 because the other thing you kind of have this like tension between his reaction to what's going

626
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,560
 on, which is objectively very weird, very creepy, but also the fact that like his reaction to

627
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:08,880
 what is going on is in some ways basically religious intolerance. So that's kind of

628
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,920
 an interesting dynamic. But most interesting is that the bit at the end where they burn him in

629
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,240
 the wicker man, they lit the village hall windows to make them look like they're on fire. And it

630
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
 was amazing. It was so good.

631
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:28,880
 Highly enjoyed it. I thought it was a really good film. So yeah, I'm glad that I watched it.

632
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:35,680
 And it is homework for something I will inevitably pick on a future episode. So yeah, shall we wrap up?

633
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,760
 And that was the AutoStore podcast. And it's goodbye from me.

634
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,400
 It's goodbye from me. And it's goodbye from me.

635
00:49:42,400 --> 00:50:03,520
 [Music]

636
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,520
 Now it's time for Octa Thop Gaming Corner.

637
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,920
 Have you played any games recently, Jod?

638
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:17,520
 I went cottaging. Why? Yeah, I played some games. And it was, there's just so many games. But

639
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:25,040
 I played Moon, which is very good. It's about the Moon. And have I through you played Villagers?

640
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:35,360
 You say villages or villagers or villagers? Villagers. I think no. I don't think so.

641
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,960
 I mean, it wasn't a trick question. Like, so yeah, so Villagers is like a kind of drafting

642
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,840
 engine-building kind of game. And the same person who did that then did a game called Streets and

643
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,920
 has now done a game called Moon. And they're in a sort of loose trilogy. Because obviously,

644
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:56,720
 if you extrapolate, if you draw a line between villages and streets, and then you extrapolate that,

645
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,320
 the next step is Moon. I think we can all agree. So he's made about to go out of the Moon. But it's

646
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,000
 very good. It's very, very good. It's kind of very, it's like an engine builder,

647
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,240
 tableau builder kind of game. And it's just really nice. And it comes with loads of adorable little

648
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:16,080
 rovers. And it comes in a lovely box. And it was pretty great. I also played a game I loved the

649
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,000
 Nick and Neil have. But last time I was at the house, I was like, this is a shrink wrap. We could

650
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 play this. And Neil was like, I don't think I want to play that. But it turns out it's really good.

651
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,800
 Well, it's called Insider. And it's 20 questions. But one of you knows what the answer is to obviously,

652
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,120
 the person answering the questions knows what the answer is. But then another person who is

653
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:40,400
 ostensibly asking questions also knows what the answer is. And they have to try and get the group

654
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,280
 to the answer without making it too obvious that they already know what it is. And that was real

655
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,320
 good. We played that quite a lot. And we also played a game called Cheering Machine, which was

656
00:51:50,320 --> 00:52:00,080
 fine. I have played Cheering Machine quite a lot online. I thought that it was a bit

657
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:07,440
 it felt like a bit like work, really. It didn't scratch my puzzling itch anything like as much as

658
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,960
 people online seem to think it does for them. And I'd rather just be playing one of my little

659
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,760
 road likes or something that does the same sort of thing, but in a in a less bored game way.

660
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:26,800
 Yeah, I was really excited about Cheering Machine. And then I don't think I like it as much as

661
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:33,920
 Cryptid or Search for Planet X. Like, so it's a kind of logical deduction game. But it's very solo.

662
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,320
 Like there's vanishingly little player interaction. And yeah, I don't know. I just feel like having

663
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,000
 played it. I'm not sure I really want to play it again, which is a better problem.

664
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,760
 So the idea is you play it a few times and then you start making it harder. And the more harder you

665
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,360
 make it, the better it gets people say. But I didn't I found it a bit kind of headcrunchy.

666
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,720
 And and obviously then you then might need to handicap it for different people. It might be

667
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:06,480
 one of those games like set where the same person will win every single time unless you're careful.

668
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,280
 We played like the first two introductory games in the rule book. And then I was like,

669
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,280
 well, this all seems fine. Let's just do the daily challenge. And I did the daily challenge

670
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,600
 and I solved it in the same number of steps as I solved the second puzzle out of the rule book.

671
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:25,040
 So I'm like, it might be that the daily challenge was just quite easy that day. But I have a worry that

672
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,040
 yeah, I don't know. I'm just not sure if it ramps up the difficulty enough to keep my interest.

673
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,320
 But I might just have gotten lucky with the challenge I played. I don't know. It's a shame

674
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,400
 because it looked really cool. You know, Marianne and I played it because it takes no time to play

675
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,760
 online. Marianne and I played it about nine times in an evening. So that's the other thing is that

676
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:50,880
 it's part of what people like about it is the kind of physical box design, which game design,

677
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:58,080
 which means that it solves the things using punch cards, which is kind of very retro and charming.

678
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,840
 Yeah. I do know how that trick works because it's like binary chop. I played a game called

679
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:10,080
 Hadrian's Wall, which I've been wanting to play for the longest time. And it's suddenly turned up

680
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:15,520
 on board game arena. So we played it the other day. It is like the world's biggest, most complicated

681
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:22,160
 role of right. But that is also extremely solo. So honestly, the only interaction between people

682
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,760
 really is that you compare scores at the end of the game. You know, your your your Romans, your

683
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,800
 building, Hadrian's Wall, you're you're doing other things. You have a lot of things to do.

684
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,320
 It's really interesting because it generates a very lot of interesting game choices from

685
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,920
 almost no randomness. So there's just like you draw a couple of cards at the beginning of each

686
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,480
 round. There are six rounds. And apart from that, there's nothing random happening at all.

687
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,920
 And yet there's the scope for a lot of it. So people do like it a lot.

688
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,600
 Nice. Liz, have you played any board games? No. Oh, and that was the first board game I had

689
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:07,040
 played for two months, John, two months. Yeah, because you were but you yeah. I went on my

690
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,320
 tap trip. I saw my first board game cafe in Toronto, because that was when they were still like a new

691
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,840
 quite whimsical idea. Okay, we'll let Liz go to sleep now or you know, stay up all night partying.

692
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,000
 Liz is looking pretty tired. I'm playing a game.

693
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,080
 What game are you playing? What right now? I'm playing this game that I think I linked in discord.

694
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:35,600
 This the root trees are dead like deduction game. It's basically revenge of the Obra Din,

695
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,680
 but a bit simpler in a new browser. And it's got tricky. Please put a link. Yes.

696
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:47,440
 And that was how Alison got no more done today. Yeah, I really got sucked into it. So if I got

697
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,840
 sucked into it, I'm a bit worried for Alison. I Obra Din, I played for three hours and then

698
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,520
 stopped playing it and I've never picked up again, but I probably will pick it up again at some point.

699
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:03,680
 Oh really? Remember, I like I prefer non-narrative games. Big butts and I cannot lie.

700
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,880
 Oh, it's Obra Din narrative. Obra Din is a narrative game. I mean, it's a stop, you know, you're working,

701
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,680
 it's a puzzle game, but you're working, you're working a thing out.

702
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:17,440
 I mean, I liked it well enough and I, I shouldn't have stopped it. I just, you know,

703
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,200
 I had somewhere to be. I just carried on playing until it was done.

704
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:26,480
 So this is very similar, but there's like less blood. So you might like it. Did you also see that

705
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:33,840
 there's a YouTube Sudoku solving channel who decided to do a playthrough for avenge of the Obra

706
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,640
 Din? Well, it's probably cracking the cryptic, isn't it? Probably. Cracking the cryptic,

707
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:46,640
 the, the, the kind of tentung gorilla of Sudoku channels and they did Bobbirous U and I think

708
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:52,560
 they did a bit of the witness as well. The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by
