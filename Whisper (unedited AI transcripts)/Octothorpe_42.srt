00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 42nd episode of OctaThorp, a podcast for science fiction and

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,200
 science fiction fandom. This episode is coming to you on the 14th of October 2021. I'm John Coxon.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,320
 I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,680
 And we have some letters of comment. In fact, we have quite a lot of letters of comment owing to

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,160
 having recorded the previous episode quite soon after the previous previous episode.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,440
 You're making sausages. We have lots of letters of comment. I also wanted to say

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,840
 it's episode 42, which surprised me because I thought OctaThort was the answer to life,

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,040
 the universe and everything.

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,560
 [Laughs]

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,160
 Possibly. Possibly.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,000
 I do hope there's no one who is actually taking, you know, life advice from OctaThorp. I think that would be

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,880
 bad.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:17,200
 If you're taking life advice from OctaThorp, please email us. And also, OctaThorp should be taken

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,160
 only as directed. Ask your physician before taking life advice from OctaThorp. OctaThorp is not a

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,840
 substitute for medical advice.

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,280
 But two thirds of OctaThorp is doctors.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,480
 Yeah, but if they came to me on a plane and said, "Oh, Dr. That Man's Having a Hardstack," I would be like,

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,600
 "Yep."

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
 Oh, there's a brilliant meme going around about that at the moment.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
 No, there's a very tedious meme going around about that.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,080
 [Laughs]

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,920
 How many times have you seen it?

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,720
 Literally, like, dozens and dozens about different niche areas.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,760
 There will be a tedious meme about that in the show notes.

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,080
 [Laughs]

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,400
 I'm not sure I've seen this meme because I do not do as much social media as some people.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,640
 Okay, well, actually, I know that Liz has got a million copies of the remails in a text, so maybe she should send you one.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
 All right, deal.

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,680
 All right, it'd be my Twitter. I'll try it. It's like when XKCD did that good thing about, like,

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,320
 you know, the different types of scientific paper, which was immediately done to death.

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,080
 And I saw like 100 different versions. And it's like you have sucked all the joy out of XKCD.

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
 How? Anyway, maybe I should spend less time on Twitter.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,680
 On the subject of sucking all of the joy about things, let's start this episode with Jonathan Badly's

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,720
 Lock about Dragon Meat's COVID restrictions. Straight into COVID listeners, you know it, we love it.

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,600
 So they're going to have mandatory masking unless people have a medical exemption,

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,800
 and they are going to require NHS COVID passes.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,160
 Good, correct. We like this. Good job, Dragon Meat. 10 out of 10. Excellent.

40
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,920
 Thank you to Jonathan for letting us know. So Ali posted to Facebook to let us know that there

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,760
 have been no reports of COVID from Francicon attendees. And also, she wrote us an email to let us know

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,480
 her experiences from Francicon. Yeah, she basically said she did a lot of program.

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,600
 She recorded fantasy book swap live with Tiffany Aching. She doesn't mean Tiffany Aching, does she?

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,240
 She used Tiffany Angus. Yes, I think so. I don't know whether it's an intentional joke,

45
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,360
 but it did make me thoughtful. So thank you, Ali. Give me some joy.

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,440
 And said social distancing was easy because there weren't that many people there. She was a bit

47
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,640
 worried about the masking of other hotel guests. But in fact, as she says, nobody at fantasy con

48
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,520
 appears to have caught COVID. And the thing that I wanted to say here is that there is a there is a

49
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,920
 lock element because one of the things that probably happened is that nobody went to fantasy con with

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,840
 COVID. And if nobody's infected at your convention, it won't spread no matter how much eyeball licking

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,000
 you do. So what you're doing when you have COVID so really the yes, it's all about risk.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,720
 This is going to be very mathematical now. Nobody getting COVID isn't good evidence of your policies

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,920
 working. Lots of people getting COVID is strong evidence that your policies didn't work. But

54
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,200
 the evidence for your policies working well is that one or two people get COVID. Yeah, because

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,880
 there's a little bit of it about, but it did not spread. We had a good policy.

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,000
 What I like about this is the very British redefinition of doing well as like a small number of COVID

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,480
 rather than no COVID. No, no, no, it's not that obviously not having anyone getting COVID is great,

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:48,080
 but it provides zero evidence for or against your policy. Okay, so Liz, the actual epidemiologist

59
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,000
 with statistical background is going to tell me that I'm talking out my head. I think it might not

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,880
 be a strong evidence as you think, because you could have a person. We know that we know the

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,680
 distribution of like how many people you infect is heavily skewed, right? And many people in fact

62
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,480
 know one and some people in fact, lots of people, but there's also people in the middle of the

63
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,160
 vet one or two. So I think you probably can't tell the difference between someone comes to your

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,800
 con who is not exhaling a lot of virus and infects one or two people, and someone comes to your

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,600
 con and exhales lots of virus because they're in a very high viral load and infect lots of people

66
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,120
 based on, you know, use that to whether you think your policies are working. You need kind of an

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,400
 actual, I think you need a better comparator, basically. And all of this tells us that the Swiss

68
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:40,400
 cheese model of health and safety work is important. You have to have your various levels of COVID

69
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:49,440
 prevention and then also be lucky or ideally not unlucky. So what we have discovered here is that

70
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,760
 the fact that no one got COVID may or may not be good. No, it's definitely good. It's whether it's

71
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,160
 good evidence. Yeah, I mean, I think the better thing to say is, you know, if we have two conventions

72
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,600
 and one is where everyone is masked up and there's a strict vaccination policy, no one gets COVID

73
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,520
 and one where they have a much more relaxed masking of vaccination policy, no one gets COVID. That

74
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,160
 doesn't necessarily mean that we should automatically go for the more relaxed one because it was fine

75
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,920
 and no one got COVID. I think that's not strong enough evidence. Bingo. Are you advocating that we

76
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:30,080
 run Control-Con? Because I'm up for running Control-Con. I'm fairly sure that if we wait long enough,

77
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,680
 someone is going to run Control-Con for us. Excellent. Ali also mentions that the book

78
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,000
 launches were in a big room with small separated tables, which is something we mentioned in the

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,720
 previous episode. One of the things we had mentioned previously was that FantasyCon didn't have a

80
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,840
 policy on mandatory masking. They were like, please wear a mask if you feel like it, but like they

81
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,040
 weren't saying you had to. But very much from Ali's lock, I get the impression that almost all of

82
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,800
 the convention attendees were still wearing a mask. So I suspect that conventions are going to find

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,880
 that even if they don't mandate mask wearing, everyone will wear a mask anyway, so you're not.

84
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,960
 There's no reason not in a way. There's no reason not to mandate mask wearing because everyone who's

85
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,280
 going is already going to be wearing a mask. So you're not really going to annoy anyone as long

86
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,000
 as you've got like stuff in place for like medical exemptions. I saw a lot of photos from FantasyCon

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,600
 and nobody was wearing any masks in any of them. And what's going on as somebody said to me

88
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,880
 in a meeting for a different convention is that everyone stops masking where they're socializing

89
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,440
 with their friends. And over the course of the whole weekend, everyone socializes with all their

90
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:49,520
 friends, which covers everybody at the convention. So this is the great fallacy of COVID prevention.

91
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,080
 So when you actually go and do a thing with specific people and not any other people,

92
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,200
 you are exposing yourself to far less risk and your friends to far less risk than if you go to a

93
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,280
 convention and spend the weekend socializing in small groups, none of whom are masked.

94
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,640
 But if you have masks on in the common spaces outside of like your table at the bar and being

95
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,200
 on panels, your risk is lower than it would be if you didn't mask in those times. So,

96
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,640
 and because we know COVID is exponential, small decreases in risk are important to control and

97
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,960
 spread. Yes, they are. I think the other thing to consider is that sometimes people take their

98
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
 masks off to take a nice photo and then put the mask back on it. Oh, that would be that that's

99
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,720
 great if it's true. If you're anymore posted a picture to Instagram, which she said, don't worry,

100
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,960
 I only took my mask off for this photo. So I did see some evidence of of that, as Liz said.

101
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,920
 But yeah, it's good. I think it's good that FantasyCon went off and it's good that it seemed to go

102
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,600
 well. I didn't go because I'm a bit concerned. I was a bit concerned about the masking, but

103
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,960
 but I'm glad it went well. And actually it kind of reassures me for conventions coming up in the

104
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:03,840
 rest of the year. So that is good. On the topic of Novicon, we got a suite of comments or a talk

105
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,240
 from Andr Rosen, where she says, "Pause his octa-thorp, goes to read Novicon policy she knew

106
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,280
 nothing about on page. She didn't know existed." So putting the news out, glad to be of service and

107
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,800
 and also and bought the witness, which I have not yet done, but I'm excited to

108
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,840
 when I finished SpiritFairer, 94% complete on SpiritFairer, so it's not far off.

109
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,880
 Sounds like you really liked it then and I should give it another go.

110
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,400
 I'm not really sure. It definitely gets better in the middle. Like there's a point in the middle

111
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,360
 where you have enough to do that the bit where you have to actually do the management of your

112
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,000
 boat becomes like compelling enough to keep you playing. And then at the end when it starts

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,160
 tailing off again, you're like, "Okay." And at the beginning there's not enough happening

114
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,080
 for it to keep you engaged, I think. So it's very definitely a game with the bell curve

115
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,240
 in terms of like excitement over time. On the subject of COVID policies at conventions,

116
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,000
 Bill Burns writes in to say that he was listening to episode 40 and Chris was a bit wrong about

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,880
 US privacy laws not allowing anyone to ask about medical information such as vaccine status,

118
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,120
 the applicable federal law is HIPAA, which requires that personal health information be

119
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,360
 kept confidential, but it applies only to information held by doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.

120
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,680
 But it doesn't apply to interactions between an individual and organizations not defined in the

121
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,840
 act. So if an airline or a convention or a shop wants to say, "You've got to show vaccine status,"

122
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:38,160
 and if you don't, we won't let you in, they are more than able to do that. And because Bill

123
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,200
 writes business software for companies which supply medical equipment, Bill is covered under

124
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,360
 HIPAA, and so is intimately familiar with all of these various bits of US law. So thank you very

125
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,720
 much, Bill, expert knowledge. Thank you for letting us know. Very interesting stuff.

126
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,400
 And then Chris Garcia writes in saying that sanitizing mics is actually quite easy,

127
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,880
 because the other thing he knows you can do the 20-minute ultraviolet boxes,

128
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,960
 which were mentioned last time, but he says that you can also just remove the phone, toss it,

129
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,840
 wipe the electronic bits down with bleach, and then put new foam on, which is slightly less

130
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,480
 environmentally friendly, but I can see that it would be a lot quicker if you had lots of people

131
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,800
 kind of all doing things in quick succession. And that's something we hadn't mentioned. So thank

132
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:41,600
 you for writing in Chris. He also says I do the best in podcasting. You can store all these for

133
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,600
 later, John. And when we launch our Patreon, there will be a soundboard, which is Alison,

134
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,680
 just doing different mhmms and Liz doing different cheeses.

135
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:01,760
 Jesus. Doing different cheeses is title of your sex tape. On the subject of high school movies,

136
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,320
 which is apparently the gift that keeps on giving, Bridget Bradshaw tweets at us to say that

137
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,600
 election is also a very good film. I searched letterbox for election, and there are a number of movies

138
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,880
 by this name. So I'm assuming one of them is a high school movie, but I've asked Bridget,

139
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,640
 which one she actually means. So I can put a link in the show notes. Eddie Cochran wrote in to say

140
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,960
 that one of his favorite high school movies was The Faculty, which he found surprising as he's not

141
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,000
 usually a horror fan. Lily and Edwards mentioned Buffy the Vampire Slayer and how she was surprised

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,280
 that none of us mentioned it. And I wonder whether I cut us mentioning it out. So I'm sure we said

143
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:47,040
 something about that. I'm going to say I definitely 100% mention Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And if John

144
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,920
 cut it out of the episode, then that was clearly a cut too far. So I take full responsibility for

145
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,120
 this as editor. But then I should have noticed and said, Oh no, we need to put it back in. Otherwise

146
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,000
 Lillian will write. I mean, and we got a lock. So really, it's good. And then Farah also wrote in

147
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
 to say that I needed to watch Romy and Michelle's high school reunion. And I have indeed seen that

148
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,200
 movie and I very much enjoyed it. And I would say that Farah is probably right about that. So yes,

149
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,080
 high school movie update. I was going to say that I suspect Bridget is meaning the 1999 film

150
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,240
 election, which I have seen a long time ago. And yeah, it is pretty good. It is a kind of like

151
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,120
 dark comedy with Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick. And I suspect that's the one she means

152
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,640
 gonna remember that getting quite a lot of attention at the time. And the director's gone on to make

153
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,280
 a load of other films like sideways and the descendants and so on. It's probably that.

154
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:50,000
 Live follow up Bridget tweets to say that she does indeed mean the 1999 Broderick Witherspoon movie.

155
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 So, hoorah, well done Liz. I'll put a link to that in the show notes. And I'll put links to all

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,720
 of the other movies we've mentioned in the show notes as well. So yeah, thank you to everyone who

157
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,520
 wrote in. Farah also mentions that Asterix is a classic choice for language expansion. And that

158
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,160
 had not occurred to me. But now it has occurred to me I will be buying lots of Spanish language

159
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,520
 editions of Asterix books. So thank you very much Farah.

160
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,720
 We'll be talking about language acquisition because and it is actually on topic because I

161
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:29,200
 am going to smothcon, which is at the beginning of December, and it's in Lisboa. And I am therefore

162
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,400
 learning Portuguese, a language which I had no idea I needed to learn for fun just a bit.

163
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,840
 It's full of words that don't look like I should know them. But when they're pronounced,

164
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,760
 I go, oh yes, that's cheese. And so on.

165
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,560
 We are going in person. I am. No, I want to. I should say this here because I've been actually

166
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,280
 holding this up and not posting about it. Dublin 2019 offered I think 19 scholarships to people

167
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,960
 from around the world to attend smothcon. And I don't know how many of these have been taken up.

168
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,200
 But I am I am going to smothcon on a Dublin 19 scholarship. It doesn't cover the whole cost,

169
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,880
 but it covers quite a lot of costs. And I'm taking my husband with me for a three-day

170
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,400
 mini break because it turns out that Ryanair do cheap flights. There's a song about that and

171
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,240
 we'll put a link to it in the show notes. And the hotel only costs 10 euros extra if there's

172
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,920
 two of you rather than one. And the convention has a five-year-old membership rate for people

173
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,280
 who don't actually want to attend the programme. I'm kind of wondering whether I can ask for that

174
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:41,360
 one for free instead of the full one. And I hadn't counted on the cost of getting COVID tests,

175
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,320
 but I don't think it's going to be that great because I think it's just lateral flow test.

176
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,800
 Now I'm going to go to Lisbon. I'm very excited but also very scared because flying.

177
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,680
 Congratulations. It's huge news and it's very good.

178
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,280
 And then I'm going to hide in my house for a fortnight when I get home.

179
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,600
 That's no longer required. I've done it and it was fine.

180
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,280
 I can't promise to do this, but when Liz did it, I always sent her an AeroPress.

181
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,320
 Oh no, don't do that. I have obviously.

182
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,080
 Yeah, no, I'm not going to, but Liz needed a way to get good coffee in her hotel in

183
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,920
 Toyland. So I provided her with an AeroPress. I was getting rid of anyway, so yes.

184
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,400
 I'm very confident that I will be able to get good coffee in Portugal.

185
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:33,440
 And I am even more confident that there are many, many ways to make coffee in this house,

186
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,400
 including at least two AeroPresses. Oh, well, I now have two AeroPresses because I've got

187
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,560
 John's. The thing is I didn't consider. So ship one from Toyland to...

188
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,480
 Yeah, I didn't consider when leaving that I would need one on the way back.

189
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,440
 I could have got good coffee, but it would have been like £3.50 a cup and I am a cheapskate and

190
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,280
 I was staying in hotels. So I got John's AeroPress and took it back with me and some bags of coffee

191
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,640
 and probably confused the maid. Yeah, when we stay in hotels in the UK, we take cold brew with us,

192
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,000
 but that's not going to be an option for this trip. So we're not going to fly with cold brew

193
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,560
 in the suitcase. Could you not buy any baggage because you're going on Ryaner? Yeah.

194
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,240
 Yeah, it makes sense. Anyway, I will be excited to hear

195
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,480
 from your first in-person convention. It will be my third in-person convention.

196
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,440
 By then it will, yeah. Because we'll have been to Corflu in Novacron.

197
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,520
 Haven't got to know conventions for two years. I'm going to three and six weeks because I'm

198
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:42,400
 absolutely insane. I just want to say thanks ever so much to Dublin 2019 for the scholarship,

199
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,880
 because although it's not a huge amount of money, it really does genuinely make a massive

200
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,640
 difference to me. And I'm sure that's true for a lot of other people. And I haven't been able to

201
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,400
 attend a smofcon in person before. So I am very excited. I think also I need to do a personal

202
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,080
 shout out to James Bacon who posted everywhere saying, "Do not self-exclude from these scholarships.

203
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,320
 Do not think that they're not for you or the likes of you." Because had he not done that,

204
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,840
 I would definitely not have applied. So because I would have self-excluded, I'd have gone, oh no,

205
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,200
 they're really for younger fans or fans who are more interested in World Cons rather than

206
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,280
 Easter Cons or fans who don't run snitty podcasts about the World Cons.

207
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,680
 I was just going to say that I have been to a smofcon because I went to a smofcon in Amsterdam in

208
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:34,880
 2012, maybe? The reason I went to a smofcon is because James was like, "Come to smofcon,

209
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,240
 it'll be a laugh and also you need to meet Ian because you're going to run a division with him

210
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,600
 and I need you to actually sit down and chat." I think maybe, and then maybe I think he couldn't

211
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,560
 go. Anyway, I went and it was extremely World Con heavy and the vanishing position, that's forever,

212
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,560
 but it was Amsterdam and I had a very nice time messing with Amsterdam basically.

213
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,680
 And James and I went to a bunch of comic shops when Andy has some drinking.

214
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,320
 I think that was also the one in which Aimely stood up and proposed a bid for World Con in

215
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,160
 Mairam, which eventually turned into an actual bid for World Con.

216
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,560
 I joked earlier about not wanting to go to the con. What I mean is, of course, that when I went

217
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,920
 to the long con staff weekends, I found they were best the more time I spent in the bar having the

218
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,160
 side conversations with people and maybe going to see the delights of not Amsterdam, but more

219
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:39,120
 Stephenage was particularly valuable and that actually the formal plenary and even breakout sessions for

220
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,400
 these conventions are not necessarily as useful as people think they are. I mean,

221
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,280
 the vanishing position is very important, but the thing that's important is the process of answering

222
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:57,280
 all the questions ready for it rather than the actual event which I agree is like watching paint

223
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,360
 dry. Smuffcon Europe has a commitment to con running more broadly than just

224
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,160
 Wilcon, I should say, and they are about the European regional conventions and encouraging

225
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,720
 people who are planning to do those. I think partly because that's where we get the next generation of

226
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,120
 European Wilcon runners from, they're not in my case. You know, I'm going to run a European

227
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:25,440
 Wilcon? No, obviously not. There are plenty of people who want to do this who are younger than me.

228
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,040
 I'd like to go to one eventually. I also missed out there were a couple of cons in the UK called

229
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:37,600
 con runner that I also did not manage to get to. I did go to con runner which is very focused on

230
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,000
 Easter cons actually as you might expect, so it's kind of an ideal convention for

231
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,680
 people who run Easter cons and their friends. Cool. All right con runner, that's my sole comment.

232
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:54,480
 Was it good? I think so. Must have been good then. I can't remember to be honest.

233
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,120
 Yeah, I mean it sounds good. That I usually find is not a bad sign. I remember it was in Steve,

234
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,880
 oh basically all I remember was I think I went to Stevenage, having ever been to Stevenage and

235
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,160
 probably I just spent a lot of time drinking anyway. Maybe we should move on to broadcastable

236
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,760
 things. We've got more locks to get through, so. Okay, God.

237
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,360
 Jesus. Karen Shaffer says they don't really have traybakes except as imported from the

238
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,080
 Great British Bake Off. So the Bake Off transferring traybakes to the rest of the world.

239
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:35,120
 Hoorah. Soft power. Is that all our letters in the comment? Yes. Now we move on to the other

240
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:43,120
 letters of comment that we solicited. So this is episode 42 listeners and so I thought it might

241
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,400
 be nice to talk a little bit about Douglas Adams. For those who don't know who Douglas Adams is,

242
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,640
 he was a British writer who wrote a book called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and in the

243
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,120
 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy the ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything,

244
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,280
 is revealed to be 42 and this leads to a much longer period of time in which people try and

245
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:12,160
 work out what the hell the question is. I feel like that's not actually true. I feel like what

246
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,360
 was actually revealed was the computer that was designed to establish what the answer to life,

247
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,520
 the universe and everything was came up with 42. I believe this is a piece of commentary on

248
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:31,120
 on computers and the things that they do. Anyway, never mind. Yes. So if you if you are listening

249
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,800
 to this podcast and you don't know who Douglas Adams is already, yeah, no, that would be great.

250
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,960
 Let us know. I mean, Hara for you because you've got a lot of good content ahead of you.

251
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,600
 I don't think it's very likely, but you know, that would be amazing.

252
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,440
 But yes, so we had multiple people writing with their Douglas Adams-Z kind of anecdotes and

253
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,640
 tidbits and I'll read Chris's first so that I can close his email after I've done so.

254
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,360
 Chris Garcia wrote in to say that he met Douglas Adams once and when he met Douglas Adams,

255
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,760
 he told him, "Arthur C. Clarke said hi and if you want to know more about that anecdote,

256
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:13,040
 talk to Chris in the bar." And then Alex Holden wrote in to say that he watched a repeat of the

257
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:19,040
 BBC TV series as a young lad and learned there was an accompanying novel and then he went on a

258
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,560
 shopping expedition to a second-hand bookshop and he was surprised and impressed when the shopkeeper

259
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,600
 had not only heard of the book. He supplied the full title and author when it was only partially

260
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,960
 out of my mouth. Alex still has it and it remains one of his favorite novels. I remember when I

261
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,400
 got into H.I.K. as realizing other people knew about it and they liked it was a bit of a revelation

262
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,120
 because at that point several of my hobbies were not things that other people liked and

263
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,840
 or at the very least I had not yet found the other people who liked them. I think it's probably

264
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,080
 a better way of putting it. I suspect this is something with many of our listeners sympathize

265
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,600
 with. I have some things I want to talk about my experience of H.I.K. as which is that it

266
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,400
 completely passed me by not because I hadn't been born yet like some people I could mention

267
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:12,080
 but because I was living in America at the time and it didn't really quite catch on there.

268
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,040
 What happened was that I came back to the UK and went to university in Britain and discovered

269
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,040
 that I met all these science fiction fans. They were all like, "Oh, hitchhikers, it's amazing."

270
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,960
 They were kind of like really into it. They're not as into it as the people who were actually

271
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,800
 into it who they called Towleys and who included our very own Claire Barley friend of the show.

272
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:39,200
 But when I went to my first work on, which was the, I guess the 87 work on, there was a vast

273
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,400
 amount of hitchhikers. Everything everywhere there because it really was incredibly popular

274
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,520
 amongst UK science fiction fans as you probably expect because it's very good and by then I caught

275
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:58,000
 up. I didn't buy the official hitchhikers Towel which was a proprietary Towel with the stuff on it

276
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,320
 weaved into the fabric and I kind of have regretted that ever since. It was extremely

277
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,120
 expensive which was wired and buy it but I hadn't have any money. They now trade hands for stupid

278
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,320
 amounts of money because that's the way the world works these days. I have one. I bought it

279
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:21,600
 on eBay for the princely sum of $100 and that was back at the time when the exchange rate between

280
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,680
 pounds and dollars was not as silly as it currently is. It was back in the day when it was roughly

281
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:34,240
 two to one so surfing for merchandise on eBay in the States was like a super viable way of

282
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,720
 getting good stuff in the UK. It wouldn't work these days. And it is much rarer now and people

283
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,040
 know how rare things are a bit more now I think. When Max wrote an article for my very first

284
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,240
 fanzine she described to me as the hitchhikers fan who was indexed linked to the eBay prices for

285
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,600
 hitchhikers merch which I took at the time as a great compliment. Lillian Edwards wrote to

286
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,000
 us to say she was on the committee of the first ever convention Adams came to which was Hichakon

287
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,520
 and Glasgow. She says "I ought to have lots of really great stories but all I can remember is

288
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,640
 that he was very very tall." So thanks Lillian. Lillian herself is not very very tall and has the

289
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,680
 same problem with very tall people that I do which is they're a very long way away from you in the

290
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,520
 bar. They sent photos of their people bears. They did send photos of their people bears.

291
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,640
 I think people might have heard of Douglas Adams and still not know what a people bear is but there's

292
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:40,320
 a cottage industry here in the UK where a woman makes teddy bears with two heads and three arms

293
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,040
 and they're very adorable. Every single one is different. She never repeats and we have a couple

294
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,240
 of people bears around here. Jonathan's people bear had to go to the People Bear Hospital on

295
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,520
 multiple occasions so they were kind of like "do not do that" Jonathan but there we go.

296
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,360
 Yeah I have a people bear. I have a people bear called Barry. He is blue and he has tartan paws

297
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:11,680
 and I love him extremely much. There are various... We should put a photo of a people bear in the

298
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:19,840
 show notes. Can we have a picture of Barry? So people did post photos of their people bears on

299
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,760
 Facebook and there is a link to that Facebook post in the show notes but I will also try and put

300
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,720
 the pictures as chapter art and there are a number of brilliant pictures of people bears.

301
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,720
 A bunch of people posted basically saying like "I was in his Tigers fandom through ZZ9 and ZZ9

302
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,920
 was a big formative thing for me" and so Johnny I just wanted to pick out one

303
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:47,280
 called one that Johnny had posted saying that he met a bunch of people from ZZ9 at his first

304
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:53,360
 con in 1999 and they started going to the ZZ9 pub meets and now Johnny like a lot of his friends

305
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,520
 were in London fandom and that was their route in and then you know of course there was that one

306
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,240
 AGM where a 14 year old member came along and we had to convince his dad we were responsible adults

307
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,360
 and that that was me. I was the 14 year old that they had to persuade my dad that they were

308
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,360
 responsible adults before my dad would drop me off. They had the AGM at Peterborough and I was a member

309
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,440
 of the society I got the magazine and I said to my dad "I want to go to the AGM" and that was when I

310
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,520
 met Doug Spencer, I met Flick, I met Simo, God who I was there, um Red.

311
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,160
 And did you meet any responsible adults?

312
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,800
 I don't remember me any responsible adults but I think I remember meeting people who were able to

313
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:35,680
 convince my dad that they were so yes. Johnny does note that that was also the same AGM that the

314
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,680
 BBC filmed the AGM for the BBC Big Read so I was on the telly with my braces and I got the

315
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,440
 Babel Fish t-shirt. So that was my first, there is, there is televisual evidence of my first

316
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,400
 Spanish meeting rather bewilderingly. It was good and it was just, it was weird and great and I loved

317
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:02,000
 it. And now I'm in fandom, yeah, more. Oh do I have a link for you? Oh God I love the internet.

318
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,960
 What's I have a link to? Is the BBC Big Read on the hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?

319
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:16,000
 Hey, I've got... Is this gonna have John age 14? I've opened so yes. Yes I was gonna say is it on

320
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,760
 the internet, brilliant. Yeah yeah it will and if you've actually got, if you've got a good version

321
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,040
 because the version I've got was like ripped off of VHS so... Oh no it will be ripped off VHS,

322
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:33,040
 I mean there's various people saying it's very terrible. I've got one I could probably put on

323
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:40,000
 YouTube actually. When I was reading science fiction in my 20s, if you had asked of the things in

324
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,120
 science fiction, which one is going to be reality in 30 years, a device that you put into your ears

325
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,960
 that ought to translate to every language in the universe would not have been one of them.

326
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:58,960
 And yet here we are. It's just unbelievable. It's, it's, it's my biggest gosh wow oh boy oh boy

327
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,560
 moment of my entire life. That is completely fair. So well done Douglas Adams who also went to my

328
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,560
 college and has something to say on Big Sofas which is another things going on in my life.

329
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:15,120
 What do you have to say on Big Sofas? I take rotated the sofa through four-dimensional space

330
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,360
 to get stuck flat. Don't gently right? Yeah yeah yeah. A bunch of people posted on Facebook to let

331
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,120
 us know their experiences from kind of Douglas Adams and how they experienced him and there is a

332
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,640
 link in the show notes if you want to go and read all the reminiscing. It's really good.

333
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,520
 It's really positive. Just loads of people being like I love that and I love how it got me into

334
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,200
 the stories and hurrah. And so yes Liz you read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

335
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,960
 I did read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I read it at quite an early age I think because my dad

336
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,440
 had it and he had these great covers where if you had all four of them you could arrange them in

337
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,000
 four different ways to get four different, four different pictures. Oh god I feel so old now.

338
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,040
 Sorry Alison. When were you born Liz? Is this the first little question? 1982.

339
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,600
 Three. I was one year out. Before John is the crucial thing I think. Before John but critically

340
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,960
 so that you could have it read to you as bedtime stories. No no no I read it but I'm not that you.

341
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,880
 I read it myself because there was a copy in the house when I was growing up because my dad

342
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,720
 owned that four book box set is the thing. But he also had taped the tv show off the tv so he had

343
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,680
 it on a VHS and so I think I watched that before I even read the books. So interestingly I came through

344
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,400
 the tv show and not the books and never listened to the radio show until much later. But I also

345
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,600
 had a bunch of other stuff around. So I picked up a copy of the radio scripts in a second damn

346
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,240
 bookshop and I liked Adam's philosophy on taking lots of baths and eating lots of bovril sandwiches.

347
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:56,960
 I also read Don't Panic the kind of guide the Hitchhiker's Galaxy that Neil Gaiman wrote

348
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,240
 and I think that may have been the first like Neil Gaiman book. Nice. Sorry I all these quite

349
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,360
 but I never I never found I never went to ZZ9 or even thought about looking for ZZ9. I think

350
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,760
 it just never occurred to me so I didn't know the ZZ9 existed until I started coming to conventions

351
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,240
 and then with all the stores selling two headed three-armed bears. So the thing that happened to me

352
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,520
 was I was in the Lego Club and so I knew that if I liked something enough there might be someone who

353
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,880
 would send me a magazine about it and so every hobby I then developed after Lego I would look on

354
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,200
 the internet to see if there was a club I could join that sent me a newsletter about it and with

355
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,320
 leather bookmarks there was not but with Douglas Adams there was and that was how I going to find

356
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,080
 them. So it's actually the Lego Club that really I guess gave me the impetus. So John is young enough

357
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,760
 that he grew up with the internet which is really weird because I thought that was only two of

358
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,480
 children but clearly isn't now. Liz is going to say yeah I sort of grew up with the internet but

359
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,680
 not really right. Well I mean I knew when I was 13 but then it was internet where you know you had

360
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,720
 to go to the specific computer and connect it to the internet and then you know had a certain

361
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,320
 amount of time because you were paying a penny a minute for the phone call not like it is in my

362
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,480
 pocket and always on. So I think it has a fundamentally different relationship with the internet.

363
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:20,080
 I have uploaded a video which is my rip of the AGM clip and I am in it I am in three bits

364
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:28,800
 and I am young. Right excuse me briefly while I go and look at little tiny baby John.

365
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:37,040
 I am like I am sorry. So we could just rather link you to the entire thing we could just

366
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,440
 insert John because that is the only thing that is very interesting about this. Because it has also

367
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,800
 got like young Doug young Heidi flick. Yeah well I mean I have got I have linked to the 30 minute

368
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,480
 shows so I have thought that I have put a link in the show notes to it on YouTube so it might be

369
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,800
 the same thing. But no it is not. Oh no this is the ZZ9 AGM not the thing yeah okay. The ZZ9 AGM

370
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,200
 wasn't in the Hitchhiker's Guide episode it was in the weathering Heights episode for reasons I still

371
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,600
 don't quite understand. Wow. So the Hitchhiker's Guide episode did not have the ZZ9 plug in it.

372
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,440
 It was in a different episode. So yeah thank you to everyone who wrote in. I think it's probably

373
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,440
 people can tell from the way I describe it that it was a huge formative part of like my

374
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,920
 I guess my like teenage years really I came across them when I was 11 so

375
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,560
 and like kind of is my route into fandom and I think even if that's not true for you I think

376
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,160
 people do still have very fond memories of it because it's still such a great

377
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:44,480
 thing and it really stands up. It's also still very the radio shows are still very very very

378
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,200
 funny and very well produced and I think it was very influential on British fandom in lots of ways

379
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,080
 when you're thinking about ways in which British and American fandom differ the fact that we like

380
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,000
 things that are funny has to be one of the main ones. Don't all right. I'm sorry I watched this clip

381
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,360
 John is that you like right in the middle right at the very end? Yep that is me. Yeah you're almost

382
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:14,080
 unrecognizable. I do not I had to get a new passport earlier than I should have done because

383
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,040
 when I started going to conferences my passport photo was when I was like 17 and there was a point

384
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,320
 where US security they stop they nearly stopped me getting on a plane because they were like

385
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,440
 we do not believe this is your passport which is I was like I'm gonna get a new passport now

386
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,120
 because I was terrifying. I recognize like Duggan and Heidi and and Flick and Alex but I think if

387
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,080
 you hadn't told me that was you I would not have realized it was you. I do look quite different now.

388
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,120
 Yeah it's amazing. I bulked out I used to think when I was that age I thought I was fat I'm looking

389
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,800
 back oh like body image is a hell of a drug isn't it? You're a skinny wee thing. I was. It's

390
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,880
 why that your face is different. Okay but yes like I say thank you very much for everyone who wrote

391
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,520
 in. Brilliant. Oh god I remember something else I should have said about Douglas Adams.

392
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,400
 Douglas Adams also the first absolute died in the wool will accept no substitutes Mac

393
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:16,960
 Junkie who I ever really encountered not in person but but in his writings really very

394
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:24,240
 had the way of it. Yeah one of the very large formative influences he had on me was his I

395
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,480
 remember it was there's a piece of writing in the salmon of doubt where he talks about how to make

396
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,240
 tea and he's like a lot of people will tell you you don't really need to know how to make tea

397
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,760
 because you made tea and it's like no those people are wrong there is a way to make tea and it is

398
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:45,760
 this and I was like that that I think had a huge influence on my thinking as like teenager was like

399
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,760
 you know trying to do things in order to get good quality things rather than just saying

400
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,720
 ah before you. I think I think I think a lot of that in me comes from Douglas.

401
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,960
 He was uncompromising about doing things to make them good and hence deadlines.

402
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,920
 And yeah exactly.

403
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:17,280
 Since last time we recorded it has been announced that there will be a world

404
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:25,920
 con bid for Dublin in 2029 and Liz you are our roving reporter who brought this to our attention.

405
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,720
 Yeah so a tweet.

406
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:35,360
 Um so they announced it I believe at the end of octa con I'm going to say I signed up to octa

407
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,600
 con but then and this is a thing that doesn't really happen for like in person conventions but it

408
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,760
 does seem to occasionally have a virtual convention. I basically didn't really feel much like a

409
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,560
 convention last weekend so I dipped in and out of the discord but didn't really attend octa con

410
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,560
 but I did technically have a membership and but I believe they announced it at the end of the

411
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,560
 convention which would make sense. A place you're going to announce your Irish binses and Irish

412
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,560
 convention announcing it for 10 years after the last one seems pretty sensible and it also puts

413
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,240
 you on a cycle where you are five years away from the next British one so you're kind of

414
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,320
 not competing for people's time and energy at the same time in the cycle. Yeah seems good I really

415
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:21,200
 like 2019 I'd have to go back to Dublin. Seems like a good thing. Yep I agree. I'm not hugely keen on

416
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,480
 world con bids announcing further and further and further in advance just because it seems to

417
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,200
 then sort of take well why am I not keen? I'm not keen on world con bids announcing further and

418
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,680
 further in advance because I think it's sort of then like can end up with you doing a lot of active

419
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,080
 things a very long way in advance which can sometimes mean the whole cycle of world con bidding and

420
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:47,120
 world con running takes a very long time and takes a lot of people's effort but I guess it does make

421
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:54,320
 sense if you are trying to maximise your bid energy into bidding for a year when you have little

422
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,880
 competition there's a sense to which if we have a certain number of world con bids that is about

423
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,960
 the same as the number of world con gears then it makes sense to kind of plan in advance when

424
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,760
 you want to do it. Does that make sense? I mean I think things like three way and four way bidding

425
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,600
 can sometimes result in people putting a lot of effort into bidding and then having to decide

426
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,880
 if they lose whether they want to immediately turn around a bit again at which point you might

427
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,600
 have been bidding for five years before you start even running your convention but in this case I

428
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,320
 think it makes total sense because you know it says look Dublin did a great world con we would

429
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,960
 like to do it again. I think taking a space where we're saying actually we think Britain and Ireland

430
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,040
 between them are up for a world con every five years is quite interesting I think that probably

431
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,280
 does reflect the amount of um fanish energy in the countries compared to the United States and

432
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,640
 North America generally and um I think that's quite interesting I we might be a bit tired by

433
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:57,040
 2019. I'll definitely be tired by 2019. 2029. 20 did I just say 20? You see this is how tired I am.

434
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,160
 Alison is so tired she was tired two years ago. One of the things that seems to happen to you

435
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,560
 when you're old and also me is that you lose decades out of your life quite a lot so you keep

436
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,400
 thinking that things are 10 years less ago than they actually are or that something happened in a

437
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,640
 decade 10 years out from when it did or that we're actually in the something we're actually in 2011

438
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:32,080
 2021. We are in 2021 right? I'm losing track. Pretty sure. We are still in 2021. Also in world

439
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:39,200
 confutures um there's Sarah Felix has a Texas bid going on. Yes which is very exciting.

440
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,120
 Which I have pre-supported. I have pre-supported this is outrageous really. This is how merchandise

441
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:51,360
 works guys. I pre-supported um the Texas bid because Sarah has a bunch of ribbons saying I

442
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,960
 pre-supported Texas before it was cool that she's going to give out at smothcon and I want one.

443
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,600
 Um I mean that is fair. I have a question for you Alison. Which year is the Texas bid?

444
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:10,480
 I don't know. It's for the future. Is it on the internet? It's not for the past is it? No I

445
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,880
 don't think I mean literally I think this is Sarah and a bunch of $20 bills. Yeah I mean I don't

446
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,320
 think it's launched and the says I mean this is people thrusting $20 bills on Sarah. If I pay

447
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:27,120
 you $20 can you get me a iPre-supported Texas before it was cool ribbon please? No what you need

448
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:35,200
 to do is pay um I'll send you we'll put the link in the show notes. Basically you pay pal her she's

449
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,400
 got a link in her. I think she's actually got a one-click link now for pay palang and then if you

450
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,680
 tell her you'll get your ribbon from me at smothcon um after smothcon that's what we'll do.

451
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:54,000
 A nice good stuff. They're not not I don't know what I'm going to see but I'll push it in the

452
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,080
 blip. Okay brilliant and if that Facebook post is public there'll be a link in the show notes

453
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:09,440
 and then you can pre-support Texas too. I want to send us dollars PayPal none of your flim flam.

454
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,080
 Stop pay paling people money for cons while we're recording the podcast. Roger that.

455
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:20,800
 [Music]

456
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,280
 I want to plug the science fiction encyclopedia. This is a big thing that has happened in the last two

457
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,680
 weeks which is it's now in its fourth edition on its own website. We'll put a link in the show notes.

458
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,640
 It has parted ways with Galance who have been looking after it for the last little while

459
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,040
 and is now being run by its own holding company and answerable editions which

460
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,480
 is the publishing arm of Dave Langford. Dave Langford clearly has three arms like Beable Bear

461
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,680
 two regular ones and one publishing one and it is in fact edited by Fred of the Show Dave Langford

462
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,240
 and also John Clute and Graham Slight is the managing editor which I assume means he does

463
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,520
 all the grunt work and gets none of the major credit and they also remember Peter Nichols as

464
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:16,720
 the founding editor. So yeah it remains an extremely good resource for everything in Azure.

465
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,480
 That probably won't tell you how to pre-support the Texas bid. It's not very funny.

466
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,640
 It's not a sort of thing I expect to get from an encyclopedia to be fair.

467
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:37,440
 Fine. If you are going to NovaCon then we are doing OctaThorp Live. We will have an exclusive

468
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,080
 stunt Lizz. Lizz why aren't you coming to NovaCon? Because I live 6,000 miles away and the UK

469
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,280
 doesn't believe I am vaccinated. That's fair. I explained it to the head of programme at NovaCon

470
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,360
 by saying that the train links between Bangkok and Buxton were poor which I believe is true.

471
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,360
 I mean to be fair the trains to Buxton are rubbish it's probably still paces or something.

472
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,600
 You technically could get the train from Bangkok to Buxton because of the Eurostar but it just

473
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,680
 wouldn't be like quick. You can't. So this is a complete digression but I don't think you actually

474
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,600
 can get any trains internationally from Thailand that cross into another country at the moment.

475
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:22,720
 I think I actually have to get a non-train link somewhere. I did obviously look at this at some

476
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,720
 point and I think actually what I would have to do is start in Vietnam and from Vietnam you can do

477
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,080
 the whole loop through up to the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow and then through to Paris and

478
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,480
 then on the Eurostar. But I don't think I can do the first bit. Anyway obviously at this point I

479
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:45,760
 can't do any of that but in general. Sarah says it's 10 years out so I think it's a bid for 2020-30

480
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:54,080
 one. Jesus I'm gonna be dead. You heard it here first folks. Yes we'll be doing OctaThorp Live with

481
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,120
 a stunt Liz who at this moment is a secret. We have asked them and they have said yes but we're

482
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:08,560
 keeping a secret to raise the suspense. Can I get a new? And it'll be good. It's a one o'clock on

483
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,040
 Sunday in the afternoon not in the morning. So it'll be good and we're really looking forward to doing

484
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,960
 it and we will see you all there. Haven't thought about how to actually do the technical side yet but

485
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,560
 I'm sure it'll be fine. Yeah it'll be the first OctaThorp Live that is actually like live and in person

486
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,480
 isn't it? Yes and also the first OctaThorp without Liz. Yeah so I feel that really truly the first

487
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,920
 OctaThorp Live and in person will not be to lie in there obviously. Oh yeah obviously it will be a

488
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:43,520
 pretend OctaThorp. We will get you round we will get you on to OctaThorp Live at some point. You will

489
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,360
 come to the UK for a calm one day right? Yes I will come back at some points yeah. So let's go

490
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,120
 to 2024 put us on the program or we'll hunt you down.

491
00:45:53,120 --> 00:46:09,680
 Okay so... Picks. Picks. My so I've got a choice of two picks this time around and I think I'm going

492
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:17,120
 to pick Lovecraft Country. Now I appreciate this is an old I say old. This is a TV series that

493
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:22,000
 everyone already watched and talked about and I am aware of that but at the time it was on now TV

494
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,640
 I did not have now TV and now I have now TV which is now called now but it is still on now so I

495
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,880
 have now watched it. It is very good. I liked it a great deal. I was a little bit worried it would

496
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,520
 end on a cliffhanger because I know that they only got the news they weren't doing a second season

497
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:45,600
 kind of quite recently like a couple of months ago I think but actually the first season ends on

498
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:51,840
 quite a good note if that is the end of the whole series and yeah I thoroughly enjoyed it. Really

499
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:57,360
 thought it was good and reminded me quite a lot of watchmen in some ways not in plot ways but more

500
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,960
 like it's cool that we've now got a couple of different SFNal shows that show the black experience

501
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,440
 and parts of that that I had not really been exposed to before so I thought that was really

502
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:15,280
 really neat. So yeah really enjoyed it would recommend it's on now. Now is £10 a month but

503
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,040
 there are often like discounts and deals you can find if you slough on the internet so yeah

504
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:27,840
 I enjoyed it. Have I either reviewed seeing Lovecraft Country? I have the book in my To Be

505
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:35,200
 Red pile. Oh yes it's based on a book I need to... I had it out of the library and the library said

506
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,400
 you need to bring this back so I took it back and said oh I'll buy the ebook instead and the

507
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,240
 ebook is 99p so yeah that's a good idea I would recommend it despite the fact that I haven't read

508
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,080
 it yet but yeah by Matt Ruff I think. Yes and I've read other things by Matt Ruff but not Lovecraft

509
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,320
 Country. I also haven't watched it because I would need to subscribe to another streaming service

510
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:03,120
 to watch it and I just haven't got round to you know rotating my streaming services round to HBO

511
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:11,280
 yeah see also television bankruptcy and the fact that apps have sprung up where

512
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,760
 that are designed to allow you to easily subscribe or unsubscribe from all these different things

513
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,640
 month and month by month which might be good but yeah no I'll put it on my list for next time I get

514
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:29,760
 now TV I will watch it along with whatever else I'm watching on now. Very quickly I watched Avengers

515
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,160
 Endgame which is a load of all Bobbins and I've picked up Bobbins from the Sudoku guy.

516
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:42,960
 I watched Avengers Endgame which is a load of all Bobbins and John said perhaps you don't like the

517
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,720
 MCU very much why do you keep watching it and I realized that we're going through a process in

518
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,040
 my house I live with somebody else which is something that you know in general I recommend

519
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:00,880
 but I go let's watch a movie tonight we could watch this well-remarked Korean drama or we could

520
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:11,040
 watch this short funny modern comedy or this Hugo nominated movie or Hugo finalist movie or we could

521
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,600
 watch the latest round of extruded MCU product and on every occasion when I do this my husband says

522
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:24,080
 oh I quite fancy the next round of extruded MCU product he doesn't say that he says oh let's watch

523
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:29,760
 Avengers Endgame that sounds great so I am actually going to tackle this domestically

524
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,880
 but I probably am going to carry on watching MCU for this reason because sometimes you just

525
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,000
 live with somebody else and they like the MCU more than you do. I also want to talk a bit about

526
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,600
 Foundation which is on Apple TV which Apple TV plus which as we know is the streaming service

527
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:54,800
 that nobody has #WatchTedLasso I've watched two episodes so far quite like it it takes massive

528
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,920
 liberties with the plot and obviously taking massive liberties with the plot is quite good

529
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,240
 thing in the case of Foundation because the original books have quite a lot one with them

530
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,280
 and I think the TV CEO will have different things wrong with it and they've done quite a lot of

531
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,200
 quite clever things to cope with the fact that the action in this story happens over a very long

532
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,880
 time which makes things harder if you're trying to cast a TV show with a recurring cast

533
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:28,720
 so and it's very pretty it's they've spent a lot of money on CGI visitors I don't much like CGI

534
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,960
 visitors but you know I know understand that a lot of people do so I'm glad you're enjoying it

535
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,520
 I mean I'm also watching Foundation and I have Ted Lasso having finished I'm now at the stage of

536
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:46,720
 do I keep subscribing to Apple TV basically just so I can watch Foundation and maybe I did enjoy

537
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:53,760
 the first two and well trying to spoil too much I mean I haven't read any books it does set up

538
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,720
 stuff like the end of episode two ends in a reasonably dramatic fashion which episode three

539
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,920
 basically ignores because they've definitely got a plan which is to do things quite slowly

540
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,600
 but after quite enjoying the first two the third one is like oh are you going to tell me anything

541
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:14,240
 about that thing that happened at the end of episode two? No not yet I saw a fan theory about the end

542
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,600
 of episode two and in fact even even if somebody has said to me there's a fan theory I'd have known

543
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,680
 what the fan theory was and having heard the fan theory I'm like oh of course that's what's

544
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:32,240
 what happened there so it's it it doesn't come out that way I'll be very surprised I mean I do

545
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:38,800
 like the kind of eternal emperor of different age clones but I understand that's not in the books

546
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,920
 that's a made up for the series thing yeah they've made a top so they can use the same actor all

547
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,320
 the way through which is really clever you know I'm going to give them props for that that's a

548
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:55,600
 really good choice in how you move things on to on to uh television transfer things from

549
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:03,200
 from book to television whilst keeping their essential nature but being able to cast an actor

550
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:10,160
 or three actors in this case it's very clever yeah if you recall last time I said I was reading a

551
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,240
 book that was pretty good but I hadn't finished it yet and so I could not recommend it for pick

552
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,800
 because I need to know if it had a good ending unfortunately I have finished a book and it's got

553
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,840
 a pretty good ending so I can recommend Children of Ruin by Adrian Tchaikovsky which is a sequel to

554
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:29,680
 his earlier book Children of Time but it's a fairly loose sequel so if you haven't read Children of

555
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,520
 Time for a few years like you'll be fine it's not one of these giant fantasy novels where you need

556
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,160
 to know exactly you know who is married to who and who fell out with who it's kind of a fairly like

557
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:45,920
 loose sequel using the same concept and the same some of the same characters it's essentially about

558
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:53,520
 you know far future humanity colonizing planets but also they set up in Children of Time a

559
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:59,760
 planet full of uplifted super intelligent spiders and Children of Ruin takes that but also adds

560
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,840
 kind of uplifted super intelligent octopuses and also they they they meet some alien life and

561
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:11,600
 it's basically a space opera novel all about communication so it has all you know your nice

562
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,480
 space opera sense of wonder stuff there's lots of you know interplanetary travel and spaceships

563
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,400
 and aliens and also octopuses and spiders but it's basically about kind of like

564
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,280
 how do you communicate when your fundamental ideas about the nature of communication

565
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:34,160
 may be completely different or your kind of you know how your species notion of like the

566
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,720
 transmission of information works is totally different and it really really digs into that

567
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,640
 in quite a lot of detail and I find it really fascinating I do think it's a little bit too long

568
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,120
 and so I was flagging towards the end and also I'd slightly lost track of who was in which spaceship

569
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:54,480
 on or on which space station and where the other spaceship had gone and so on and so I recommend

570
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,720
 reading it when you think you can kind of plow through it fairly quickly so you don't lose track

571
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,280
 of what's going on but I do I do recommend it and it is it's very good and it scratched that

572
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,840
 particular kind of I want to read a book with spaceships in each so it's good nice I haven't

573
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,160
 read Children of Ruin but I have read Children of Time and I really enjoyed it so Children of Ruin

574
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:21,840
 is on my on my list of things to read I believe Children of Time won the Arthur C. Clarke award

575
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:28,560
 and I really enjoyed it so I'm looking forward to reading the next one. In terms of books that deal

576
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,480
 with kind of language and what it is to communicate with people who don't understand you I really

577
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,920
 like that genre of book in general so Ian Watson wrote The Embedding which I loved

578
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,360
 Trying to Mayville wrote Embassy Town which I loved and the movie Arrival kind of deals with

579
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:48,800
 similar things I haven't read the short story that Arrival is based on but I have seen the

580
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:55,120
 movie and loved it so yeah it's something I'm excited to do at some point. John how have you

581
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:02,560
 have you not read that sorry sorry just like I mean it's fair it's now one like giving you

582
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,480
 stories of your life and others and locked you in a room until you've read it all. I've read

583
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:13,040
 Exhalation the compilation that was up for the Hugo award but I don't think it's in that.

584
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:18,160
 Oh no this is the previous one it's not this it's in the previous one which I have not yet read

585
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,440
 which I should which is maybe even better you should it's got some of like the best short stories

586
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:30,320
 ever in it. I mean on the subject of languages I read I think last year Native Tongue by

587
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:38,320
 Suzette Hayden Elgin which is about language in a slightly different way it's it's a dystopian

588
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:44,560
 future American and essentially women create their own new language as an act of resistance.

589
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:49,760
 Oh that's cool what's that one called? And it's really interesting it's called Native Tongue and

590
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,120
 it was it was published in the the mid 80s. Cool. And it I mean it is about translation with

591
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:00,240
 alien species but also about how the women then use these powers of translation to

592
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,600
 yeah kind of have their own list. So that's definitely worth reading.

593
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:11,280
 Good stuff. That was the 42nd episode of the OctoThore podcast and it's goodbye from me.

594
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,160
