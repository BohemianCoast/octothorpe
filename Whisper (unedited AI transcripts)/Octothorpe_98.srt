1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
 Oh shit, hang on one more.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,240
 This is our normal level of organisation, Sandra, or maybe slightly better.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,680
 Er, it's all come out in the edits.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:28,160
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 98th episode of OctaThorp, a podcast for Science

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,880
 Fiction and Science Fiction fandom, which is WENDING its way to you on the 7th of December

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
 2023.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,200
 I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott, and I am NOT Ms. Batty, and in her place you get

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,560
 on this episode you get me Sandra Bond.

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
 Hello Sandra Bond.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,400
 Hello Sandra, I'm very excited, what have you done with Liz?

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
 Hah!

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,960
 Erm, nothing Brad, why do you think I ought?

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,920
 Yes, so Liz is on assignment, erm, I can't remember what she's doing, is she on holiday?

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,440
 She's on a beach, she's on a beach.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,920
 She's doing something.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:15,280
 And so we have invited the lovely and talented Sandra Bond, who is the current TAF administrator

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,920
 for Europe, and who has been on a TAF trip, and we're going to talk about that a little

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
 bit later in the episode for shadowing.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,120
 But first we have some letters of comment, we have letters of comment from two TAF delegates

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,760
 and one very knowledgeable man.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,360
 Not to imply that the TAF delegates are not knowledgeable, or indeed not men, for they

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
 are.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,680
 So let's start with Christopher J. Garcia, who wrote in to say, "The first time that

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,200
 fandom changed his life was meeting James Bacon."

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,520
 And I think it's fair to say that everyone who's met James Bacon has had their life changed.

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,840
 And he also says that we need more Hugo categories, which, erm...

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
 Good Lord.

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
 I respect his right to be wrong.

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,920
 Isn't the ceremony long enough already?

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,760
 He makes some good arguments about why it would be a good idea to have an indie film

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:17,240
 Hugo, or a couple of indie film he goes, saying that it would be good to have more non-professional

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,880
 he goes, and obviously I can see the logic in that.

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,680
 But the problem with this Hugo is that we haven't really worked out what that would look like

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,400
 and at the moment it just kind of gives extra Hugo's for things that are already getting

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
 Hugo's, so.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:37,320
 Or also there is the problem that anything indie, is it any category of creativity, is

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,200
 immediately taken over by the corporates who sort of will label it indie and put it out

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,560
 under an indie studio or an indie record label's name, but in fact it's...

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,280
 Or an indie brewery's name, or they'll buy an indie brewery.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,560
 I mean there's a lot of beer out there that used to be independent.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,280
 Cough cough, brew dog cough cough cough.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
 Oof.

43
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,640
 Cough cough, little creatures, cough cough.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,000
 Cough cough, Camden brewery, cough cough.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,040
 Oh dear, there's a terrible cough going around this studio, isn't there?

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,680
 Yes there is.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,280
 But we talked about Glasgow's asking policy last week.

48
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
 No we didn't, did we?

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,200
 But Glasgow haven't asked me policy now.

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,880
 Yes, you can go and look at it.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,720
 There will be a link in the show notes.

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:31,680
 Yes, Glasgow are getting docs in a row incredibly early by Worldcon standards, but more of this

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,720
 when we come to talk about fanfons no doubt.

54
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
 For shadowing.

55
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,920
 Chris also says, still no stats from Chengdu, at this point I'm not surprised anymore, and

56
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,320
 that is one of the most negative things I've ever heard Chris Garcia say.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,040
 Mark Plumber's written to us twice.

58
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,240
 Mark Plumber has written to us twice.

59
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:56,160
 Mark Plumber sent us a very lovely email about Lee's emails.

60
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,240
 I failed you listeners because I did not put Lee's emails up on the internet anywhere because

61
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,640
 I had to go to the train station that I posted up to talk and I ran out of time.

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,240
 But rest assured I will put them up in full and Mark adds some more context about the

63
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,680
 rotation policy.

64
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,640
 Basically it starts in the early 1960s and Nastvik was introduced in 1975.

65
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,160
 So he notes that the situation is more complicated than we made it seem.

66
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
 John, they used a time machine.

67
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,880
 Ah, they used a time machine.

68
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,200
 Obviously 1965 was after Dr. Huard come around.

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,120
 So time machines were plentiful and available.

70
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,000
 And they used a time machine disguised as a Tiki Dialik which they'd picked up from

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,240
 the 2014 London Wilcon.

72
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,920
 And they used that in order to travel back in time and set the rotation.

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,000
 So I think I'm reading Mark Plumber's right.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,280
 It all seems very wise to me.

75
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,440
 It does seem very wise.

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,000
 We are going to put the full, we just need to put some full text of our locks on the website

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 somewhere.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I don't know how we do that, but we'll work it out.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,760
 We should probably have a website.

80
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,240
 Three years without a website.

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,800
 What's to do guys?

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,360
 Do we have to?

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,080
 The Tiki Dialik, of course, made by friend of the show Kevin Roche and Andrew Tremblay.

84
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,720
 I'm not sure they're actually friends of the show.

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,760
 They may just be friends of us.

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,240
 Um, well, what are our friends really?

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
 I don't think they listen.

88
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,960
 That seems to be drawing on rather a hairs, breaths distinction there.

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
 I did.

90
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,640
 I will just say Mark's letter did make me giggle quite a lot.

91
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,160
 So, um, so thank you very much, Mark.

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
 Mark did also write in.

93
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,120
 He says he very much agrees with Liz's assessment.

94
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,680
 This is why we're reading it out now so that Liz can't be too pleased with herself.

95
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,560
 The experience of the Chengdu WorldCon might have been very different for overseas fans

96
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
 and Chinese fans.

97
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,720
 I'm going to quote from him.

98
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,760
 "I've seen a couple of reports commenting that Chengdu was particularly international

99
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,600
 worldcon, but I wonder whether that's really true."

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,840
 I would guess proportionately at least it may have been the least international worldcon

101
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,920
 in recent history and that more than usual percentage of the members were from the host

102
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,000
 country.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,840
 And then notes that Dublin had about 30% of the attending membership that were not

104
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,760
 from the USA, the UK or Ireland.

105
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,320
 So that's actually, I hadn't really thought about it like that, but it is an interesting

106
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,160
 point and I thought it was worth saying on the pot.

107
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,480
 So thank you very much, Mark.

108
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
 Yes.

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,120
 So, I mean, I think by most international, the people who are reporting may just mean

110
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,640
 the most people who don't obviously look like us, which is certainly true.

111
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
 Mm.

112
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,560
 Well, and there is, there is definitely, there's probably an argument that it's the most different

113
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,040
 from any other worldcon in terms of the demographics.

114
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,000
 Although I guess I would have to cross check with Nippon because I assume that that has

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 a claim.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Finland.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I don't know, quite a lot of American and British fans at Finland.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Well, quite.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,400
 Yeah, but there were an awful lot of Finns at Finland.

120
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,280
 That was why they had to build new rooms.

121
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,200
 That is true, there were a lot of Finns.

122
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,440
 But were there more Chinese and Chengdu than there were Finns in Helsinki?

123
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 Yes, there were, there were an enormous number of Chinese in Chengdu, I believe.

124
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,560
 They think that they've claimed to be the largest walk on ever.

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,760
 Well, such was my impression, but what do I know?

126
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,120
 I bought an egg.

127
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,960
 I think you're a good egg.

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,920
 Oh, God bless you, sir.

129
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,680
 And then finally, we heard from Taffet delegate Kurt Phillips.

130
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,640
 Kurt says that he thinks there are already too many hughos and he shares some of our concerns

131
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,400
 about the goings-on at the business meetings in Chengdu.

132
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,560
 He hopes that they get voted down at Glasgow.

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,640
 But he did say that our book, Recommendation Sound Interesting, and he plans to pick up

134
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,680
 a copy of Goliath and a copy of Moon.

135
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,440
 He says, although he usually allows his ears to go numb whenever we talk about games.

136
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,640
 So Kurt and Mark could have a little support group, it sounds like.

137
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,920
 Something about my review of Moon broke through and since there is a gaming store where he

138
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,080
 lives, he's going to go and see if they have it and see if someone there might play it

139
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
 with him if they do.

140
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
 So Kurt, report back.

141
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,640
 Let us know how you found it.

142
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,560
 We have heard through Securitous Roots that some people might have had trouble tracking

143
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,400
 down Moon after the last episode and, hopefully, John put a link in the show notes to the

144
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,640
 board game geek link for it so that you can see a lot more about it and probably where

145
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,800
 to get it, they're not necessarily where to get it.

146
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,480
 There is more than one game called Moon because it's one of those simple words.

147
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
 Yes.

148
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,760
 But there's only more website called board game geek so far as I'm aware.

149
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,960
 So yes, and we have mentioned board game geek before, I'm sure, but it is the one many

150
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,560
 times, many, many times.

151
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,120
 One critical website for board gamers.

152
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
 There's nothing like it.

153
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,960
 It's like Ravelry for Ditters.

154
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:55,280
 If you are still struggling to locate a copy then the websites boardgameprices.co.uk in

155
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:02,520
 the UK and boardgameoracle.com in the USA are both basically websites that let you check

156
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,000
 friendly local game stores for stock of games.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,240
 I will put links to the Moon listings on both those websites in the show notes.

158
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
 We like them all for it is close to us.

159
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,120
 And that was the let us a comment.

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,000
 Thank you very much everyone who wrote in.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Oh, we should note Duncan McGregor also really enjoyed Titanium Noir.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,640
 I am going to read it, but, you know, when I find time.

163
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:32,120
 But not least Dave Coxen posted on our Facebook to thank us for the birthday shout out.

164
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,720
 He's still listening to every episode.

165
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,560
 Even though his SF status is noob, he enjoys the discussions and debates about gaming books

166
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
 and movies.

167
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,920
 He may not fully appreciate all elements of the podcast, but he enjoys the debates and

168
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,040
 how we articulate ourselves.

169
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,120
 We're a well balanced panel.

170
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,440
 The balancing is you just make sure that you're all the appropriate distance away from the

171
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,640
 middle of the seesaw and then it goes well.

172
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,240
 That was a joke about physics.

173
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,400
 Yeah, sometimes I find that if I'm on a seesaw with somebody, sometimes it needs to be

174
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,480
 quite a big seesaw.

175
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,600
 That's the name of the episode.

176
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,560
 Um, Okey-dokey.

177
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:19,160
 Thanks to everyone who wrote in.

178
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,560
 Hello, you are here to talk about TAF.

179
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,040
 Hey, how?

180
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,360
 For those listening who may not be aware, do you want to give us a very brief explanation

181
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
 of what TAF might be?

182
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,760
 With the greatest of pleasure job, yes, TAF stands for Transatlantic Fan Fund.

183
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,880
 There are many fan funds and have been for a while, but TAF is the oldest of them all.

184
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:53,440
 And it exists to send the European fan to North America or conversely a North American

185
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,240
 fan to Europe in order to attend a convention.

186
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:06,200
 Generally the Worldcon or Anista con, though I, as it happens, was the first ever delegate

187
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:13,880
 not to attend a North American Worldcon because there wasn't one, see Chengdu in earlier discussions.

188
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:21,880
 The point of the fan fund is that it is effectively it is crowdfunding, except that it's been

189
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,200
 going since before crowdfunding was really a thing.

190
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:34,080
 Kind fans donate their time, their money, their curios and their collectibles to it.

191
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,200
 And they get some auction that conventions are online in order to raise them a dough.

192
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,880
 And once that has been raised, then some lucky person gets to go and, you know, experience

193
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,480
 fandom on the other side of the Atlantic.

194
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,480
 And this year, that was me.

195
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,280
 Well, wait.

196
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,160
 And you went to Pemicon if I'm not much mistaken.

197
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
 I did.

198
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,000
 And you've done well with that, so don't, don't, don't, don't indulge in figures of speech.

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,200
 And does this, does this marvelous prize come with any form of a downside, Sandra?

200
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,280
 I don't know what that depends on whether you enjoy the, the, the admittest trivia of

201
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,000
 having to run the thing after you get back home.

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,080
 I am starting to take up the reins of running it.

203
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,200
 This has its good points and its bad points, but we will see what happens now that things

204
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:35,440
 are getting, you know, getting underway again and it's because next year in 2024, the transatlantic

205
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,640
 fan fund is expecting to send the North American fan to the Glasgow Worldcon.

206
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
 Cheers, cheers, cheers.

207
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:51,680
 Yeah, I shall be in charge of the European end of trying to make sure that that happens

208
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,520
 without any snags.

209
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,680
 I'm sure it will go swimmingly.

210
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,600
 Glasgow are fans of the fan funds, as it were.

211
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,520
 They're, they're kind of right thinking sort of folks.

212
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,760
 So very much so.

213
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,040
 And in fact, Glasgow has appointed a fan funds coordinator.

214
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,760
 Indeed, they have.

215
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,280
 Who is the very lovely Jerry Sullivan.

216
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:19,160
 I'm going to be talking to Jerry on, on behalf of Guff with Sandra for TAF and I guess other

217
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
 people who are interested in the fan funds.

218
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,400
 And we're going to be setting up, starting to talk about what Glasgow is going to do for

219
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
 fan funds.

220
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,920
 There will also be, as well as the, although TAF has, has announced their race, I'm hoping

221
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,640
 Guff will have announced its race by the time we, by the time this episode comes out,

222
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,640
 but it might not quite have, but very soon, Guff will also be announcing that there's going

223
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:46,000
 to be a race from Australia, New Zealand or, or islands in that area to, to Glasgow for

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,080
 the, for the 2024 Worldcon.

225
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
 Yeah.

226
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:57,320
 And I do want to say that the Glasgow committee have been exemplary in their support.

227
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,720
 As Alison says, they've appointed a fan fund liaison to try and make sure that the TAF

228
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,200
 and Guff winners, you know, everything goes smoothly for them.

229
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:14,560
 They've also confirmed, you know, hospitality and, you know, hotel arrangements, etc, which

230
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,680
 in my understanding this early in the game is almost unheard of.

231
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,880
 So Bravo Glasgow, I say.

232
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,120
 Thank you very much, Glasgow.

233
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
 You're excellent.

234
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,600
 It's quite the coincidence that both fan funds are sending delegates to the same convention.

235
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,360
 That's a happy accident.

236
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
 Well, I mean, not really given that that convention is a European Worldcon.

237
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,520
 Well, it's exactly so.

238
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,760
 I think we have done that every time.

239
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:47,280
 I mean, maybe not every time, but certainly for Dublin and Helsinki and Lancome and my

240
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,640
 memory of fan funds doesn't really go back further than that.

241
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
 Yeah.

242
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,920
 Every now and again, things have to be tweaked very slightly to make that work.

243
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,520
 For instance, there was no fan truck, no TAF race in 1978 because they wanted to save

244
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,600
 it from 1979 to send a American fan to the Brighton Worldcon.

245
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,680
 That's indeed they did.

246
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,800
 And it was the late Terry Hughes.

247
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,320
 Where Taf is concerned, there tend to be two different kinds of race.

248
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,760
 Either you get a ton of people all clamoring to stand and having to vote against each other,

249
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,640
 or you get tumble beads blowing around and then the administrator has to go around poking

250
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,240
 at people with a stick saying, you want to stand, don't you?

251
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,400
 The fact that it is going to a Worldcon rather than an Eastercon next year, I hope, will make

252
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,240
 it more likely to be the first kind of race than the second as far as I'm concerned as

253
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,480
 admin because it makes life a lot easier if the candidates come out of the bush themselves

254
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,880
 and stand rather than having to be chased up.

255
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,360
 Yeah, that makes sense.

256
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,880
 You mentioned Jerry Sullivan was the fan fund.

257
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
 What was the title?

258
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,960
 He said, "fan fund coordinator?"

259
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,520
 That's what I believe her role is titled, yes.

260
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,600
 Jerry, of course, is a former Taf winner herself.

261
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,080
 And I believe she is about to relaunch her fanzine idea and it's going to have a very

262
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,200
 special feature in it.

263
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:22,320
 Yes, Jerry has not published a fanzine for over 20 years, but she has now taken up that

264
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:30,840
 gauntlet once again and is as we're recording the release of the new issue of idea is supposedly

265
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
 imminent.

266
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,440
 Oh, and the very special feature.

267
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,920
 And the very special feature, if you can so call it, you flattera, is that it's got

268
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,440
 the first chapter of my Taf report in.

269
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,680
 One thing about fanfolds is that it is generally considered the done thing for a delegate after

270
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,600
 they've got home and had a reasonable time to recover.

271
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,120
 That they will write up a trip report of everything that they did and saw and engaged in that's

272
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,360
 actually printable.

273
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,160
 Hm, hm, hm.

274
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,800
 Hollow laugh there from John.

275
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,640
 Definitely don't want a report of everything you didn't saw on a trip report.

276
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
 Yeah, indeed.

277
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
 Indeed.

278
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,320
 So, yeah, there are some bits that need avail drawn over them for the sake of modesty or

279
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
 simple kindness.

280
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,560
 But on the whole, yes.

281
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:33,000
 More often than not, you know, the report will get written either in one lump or in

282
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,240
 several serialised ones.

283
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,480
 I have taken the latter approach to it on the grounds that fandom nowadays is such an

284
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:48,800
 enormous and diverse community that by serialising it across different places, it has a larger

285
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,040
 chance, at least one episode will come to the attention of more fans than if I just

286
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
 put out one booklet.

287
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,320
 Hm, yeah, that makes sense.

288
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,680
 Jerry is actually the fanfolds liaison.

289
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
 Oh.

290
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,520
 I thought you meant that the very special feature was the article that I've got on in

291
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
 idea.

292
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
 Ha ha!

293
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,320
 Well, I mean, it's an exercise left for the reader as to…

294
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,560
 It's the article about how I met Stephen that I think Joel's already seen.

295
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,400
 Oh, it's a very good article.

296
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,120
 It's been to a few places because I kind of snuck it out bit by bit rather than kind

297
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,360
 of give it to a fancy edge straight away.

298
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,480
 I want it on the record that there is a line in that article where you note that it passes

299
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,920
 two to one with one abstention and I think I was the one.

300
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
 So when you read it…

301
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,600
 I think you might have been.

302
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,000
 Note that listeners, note that.

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,520
 But Sandra has very kindly agreed to take us through part of the chapter which is to do

304
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,840
 with her time in Canada.

305
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,400
 Yes, I should perhaps also have clarified that I'm not writing this in order because

306
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,520
 Jerry was my first host when I arrived in North America and if I'd written it in chronological

307
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,520
 order I would have ended up writing a chapter largely about Jerry Sullivan before Jerry Sullivan

308
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,760
 and that seemed a little awkward.

309
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:22,880
 So I've started off by jumping forwards and writing up to Pemikon and Alison, I had no

310
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,480
 idea I'm afraid, this has come out of left field to me that you have a piece in idea.

311
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,240
 I look forward to reading it but I bet you anybody in my pieces longer than yours.

312
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,680
 Yes, how long is your piece?

313
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,320
 I don't know how long my piece is.

314
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,040
 I mean my piece is about six hours long.

315
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,280
 Yeah, the official length of my piece is too long.

316
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,480
 But yes, the piece I'm going to be reading out on this here, a very episode of Octo

317
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:56,240
 4, what it is, is basically deals with the day after I left Pemikon.

318
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,840
 Don't doubt.

319
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,000
 I don't actually know the answer to this question which is dreadfully bad form as an

320
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 interviewer.

321
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,960
 You're supposed to know the answers wherever a question you ask, right?

322
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,920
 So are you planning to do a compiled version of the report after it's kind of been published

323
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
 elsewhere?

324
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
 So Luke, I am, yes.

325
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,200
 I think people who do serialize their reports and then actually get it finished do tend

326
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,280
 to then produce a one-volume edition afterwards.

327
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,960
 But obviously enough, that is a debothor of future occasion.

328
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,680
 At the moment, I have various people who have asked me for an instalment and I've said yes

329
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,240
 to them all.

330
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,760
 Ulrich O'Brien, Nick Farrey, Mark Plummer and Claire Brierly are getting won because

331
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,560
 Banana Wings is coming out again regularly, they say.

332
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
 Hooray, hooray.

333
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
 Hooray, hooray.

334
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,520
 Oh, it's possible that Claire will be listening to this episode on Thursday because she's

335
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,680
 going to be at in-hospital having a little day operation that day.

336
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,760
 So we should wish her all lots of, said lots of love in case she's listening or Mark is

337
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,160
 listening and hope everything goes well.

338
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
 Yes.

339
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
 Absolutely.

340
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:16,800
 Octo thought, you know, wishes you, you know, the swiftest and quick and most pointless

341
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,240
 recovery possible.

342
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,680
 Yes it does.

343
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:29,280
 So if you enjoy what Sandra reads, you can look up her full TAF report and when that

344
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,040
 comes out we will, indubitably, talk about it on the podcast.

345
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,640
 And in the meantime, you can buy her novels which are very good.

346
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,720
 Yes, The Devil's Finger and The Psychopath Club, both excellent books, go and buy them.

347
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,480
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

348
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,200
 Yes, The Psychopath Club is a former pick of the episode on Octo 4.

349
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,640
 Yes, so Sandra, take us through the world of post-Pemicon.

350
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:05,760
 So Octo 4, listen as I present to you, chapter 6, part 1 of my TAF report, whose overall

351
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,520
 title is Her Beautiful Mistake.

352
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:16,320
 And this chapter's title is Moose Hats and Medicine Jaws and it deals with the 24th of

353
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,120
 July 2023.

354
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,520
 Excellent.

355
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,680
 I think crayons such as my belongings, into my various bad cases and containers as I could.

356
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:33,360
 One small case, one large case, one very small case with CPAP machine, one cardboard box with

357
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,240
 unsalted TAF auction donations from Gary Farber, one tote bad with various goodies from Joyce

358
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,080
 Scribner and Diversicott.

359
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,240
 I headed downstairs.

360
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,320
 There is an air of sadness, emptiness that hangs around a hotel which has just finished

361
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,920
 toasted the convention.

362
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,120
 Revenism to the odour from a pile of bobbitties, some spot that is unseen, it is too near

363
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
 the comfort.

364
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,960
 That air assaulted my nostrils and other senses as I reached the hot lobby.

365
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,600
 Guests and fish, they say, become obnoxious after three days, so to do conventions.

366
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,440
 Pemicon was no more and the constituent parts of it were beginning their diaspora to all

367
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,400
 part of the compass.

368
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,720
 Some of them were still around.

369
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,400
 I finally found Kurt Gibson again and apologised for not having seen him at Alice during the

370
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,160
 con after that, after their kindness in driving me up there.

371
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,000
 He had it transpired seeing me, but since he hadn't stepped out in front of me like

372
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,920
 a traffic cop to stop me and since I've been wandering about in a day as I generally do

373
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,440
 at any convention, we've missed our opportunity, alas.

374
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,680
 Marie Moore and Darth Spencer, who had done so much to make the con bearable for me, were

375
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:47,560
 knocking about two and oh joy there were luggage trolleys a plenty to be had in stark contrast

376
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,320
 to the beginning of the con.

377
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,560
 I conveyed my bags to the front door and happily found that the taxi rank, not being organised

378
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,440
 by Pemicon, actually had taxis in it.

379
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,480
 I'd almost forgotten that things in Willy-Pecard workers they were intended to.

380
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,680
 I gave the driver the address of the rental car joint to the airport, sat back to watch

381
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
 the scenery pass by.

382
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,680
 After planning my trip, I'd reasoned that by the time Pemicon ended, I would probably

383
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,920
 be ready for a few days break from having to deal with other people in any quantity

384
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,120
 at a time or for long periods.

385
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,000
 Safe perhaps for the written word format, behind the wheel of a vehicle is the place

386
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,240
 I feel most secure, content and free.

387
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,920
 I can assign the driving to the part of my brain that deals with medial tasks and free

388
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,040
 up the part concerned with higher functions, to enjoying the scenery, plotting my writing

389
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,400
 or wild speculation on the nature of the universe.

390
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,560
 And I'd found that one way vehicle rentals no longer appeared to carry the financial penalty

391
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,920
 that I was used to being attached, before Covid had given the rental car business a

392
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
 kicking.

393
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,960
 So, my plans allowed me three days to drive to British Columbia, play tourist and kickback

394
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,040
 before flying from Calgary to Las Vegas and once more, lunging into the swells of Spanish

395
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
 partying.

396
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,840
 People, the most insistent of them being far a mentalist, than whom few do insistant better.

397
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,240
 Had heard me that if I was in the western parts of Canada, I should upon no account

398
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,320
 this the Royal Tunnel Museum in Drumheller, home to countless dinosaur fossils and related

399
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
 attractions.

400
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,680
 And I decided to make that my next point of call.

401
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,560
 Sure, I could have flown in far less time, but where, I asked an imaginary interlocutor,

402
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,920
 was the funny in that.

403
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,920
 The car was applied without hitch, luggage loaded aboard and the westward road, the trans-Canada

404
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,720
 highway, indeed, beckoned.

405
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,000
 I missed a turn on my way out, but little did I care, especially since in finding my way

406
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 back to the TCH.

407
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,640
 I discovered that Winnipeg boasts a suburb named Toxedo.

408
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,480
 It was wonderful, I was free.

409
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,400
 I passed across the psychological barrier of Winnipeg's ring road and pulled my chariot

410
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,560
 into a truck stop not far beyond in head English.

411
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,360
 Over breakfast at the Denny's, I didn't know they had those in Canada, I used their

412
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,200
 Wi-Fi to plan my day.

413
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,600
 Drumheller, as I already knew, was certainly not achievable in one day.

414
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,080
 I traced the TCH with my finger across the map.

415
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,840
 Originally I planned to spend the night in or around the ginour, but all the hotels there

416
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,040
 were either unreasonably expensive or got vile reviews on TripAdvisor.

417
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,080
 And I got off to my, got off to such an efficient early start, but time for once was on my

418
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
 side.

419
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,480
 I let my finger wander on westward.

420
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,720
 After Regina, everywhere was smaller, yet with longer names as though they sought to

421
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,640
 make up for their signs of an extra-mentature.

422
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:44,560
 Bell claims, moose jaw, swift current, gunnal ache, maple creek, medicine hat.

423
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,440
 Thinking of future me writing this report, I decided that the writing at place with a

424
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,200
 silly name was just what was called for.

425
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,360
 I checked my watch.

426
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,400
 Yes, moose jaw looked just about right.

427
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,680
 Recent hotels, affordable rates, craft beer bars with positive write-ups, and I had a

428
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:06,440
 book back home called Beauty Tips for Moose Jaw by Will Ferguson that I had enjoyed.

429
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,800
 And furthermore, I ought to just about be able to make it there on the full tank of

430
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,640
 gas that had put me with my rental.

431
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,840
 I finished breakfast and was itching to be back on the road.

432
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,920
 I hastily pulled out my credit card, hit backspace a few times in my browser to reach a hotel

433
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,600
 I thought looked promising, and booked a room for one night.

434
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,000
 My heart was featherlight now as I strode out of the denny's and hit the road once more.

435
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 I'd been warned that between Winnipeg and British Columbia there was a whole lot of

436
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 flack-waffy.

437
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,720
 I didn't care.

438
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,720
 All around me, the Horizons did their best to surrender their claim on the name and retreat

439
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,000
 out of sight.

440
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,160
 The few other cars on the road bore my sense plates in ornate script.

441
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,680
 We should first I read as 'Finally, Manitoba' before I finally figured them to be 'Friendly

442
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
 Manitoba'.

443
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,520
 The divided highway stretched on ahead, reaching out for the elusive horizon, never quite touching

444
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
 it.

445
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,760
 For the sheer hell of it, I stuck to the old road rather than taking the bypass around

446
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,160
 my first silly long name of the day.

447
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
 Portage luxury.

448
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,640
 No need to stop.

449
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,240
 I had road slats and energy drinks from the truckstopper headingly.

450
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,040
 The road bore the epithet.

451
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,760
 'Manitobas, highway of heroes'.

452
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,880
 I felt like a hero myself, and I felt happy.

453
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,320
 Britain's roads were crowding, twisted and confining.

454
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
 Manitobas are a joy.

455
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,480
 A comfort break at Kirkheller, and I was across the border into Saskatumon.

456
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,480
 If Saskatumon isn't a swear word, it ought to be Bill Watterson.

457
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,240
 The boundary made no appreciable deference to the road or to the scenery.

458
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,960
 A sandwich for lunch from a gas station at Whitewood, onward, onward, west-west, west.

459
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,960
 'Near Capell, something shut across my vision.

460
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,040
 I dapped the brakes by instinct before realizing it was.

461
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,400
 I could hardly believe they had the solids.

462
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
 An actual, lots of tumbleweed.

463
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,400
 I took the bypass around the China to the south.

464
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,360
 Like Croydon, they built three quarters of a ring road and then given up before completing

465
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,400
 the final 25%.

466
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,640
 To my rise, the city's tall buildings, loomed like a child's building blocks and conquer

467
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,920
 us in the prairie flatness.

468
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
 Not far now to moose jaw.

469
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,360
 A pair of eyes met mine from the short grass at the roadside.

470
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,240
 'Fox,' I thought for a second.

471
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,040
 But the colour was all wrong.

472
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,480
 A moment's hasty thought made me provide my opinion to 'wolf'.

473
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,280
 No, surely not.

474
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,760
 Not so close to the road and not alone.

475
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,280
 Also, its features were leaner and more anguier than a wolf.

476
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,720
 It's no longer a coyote.

477
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,920
 I'd seen an actual honest to God coyote in the wild.

478
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,720
 Could it be long before I spied a roadrunner?

479
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,760
 The main highway, skirt, passed moose jaw at an oblique angle.

480
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,960
 I veered left onto the old main road and down into moose jaw.

481
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,640
 Everything around me was a small town suburb and neat and pretty at first.

482
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,040
 Closer to the centre of town, I was reminded of certain small towns about this far west

483
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,280
 in the USA.

484
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,200
 Venerable, weather but still sturdy brick buildings, housing some old businesses but more newer

485
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
 ones.

486
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,800
 A huge expanse of railroad side is spread across my leftward vision.

487
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,840
 I drifted from street to street.

488
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,480
 I'dly looking for a parking spot.

489
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,880
 I was in no hurry.

490
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,560
 I was relaxed.

491
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
 Everything was good.

492
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,120
 I congratulated past me on having made such wide choices.

493
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,560
 A bar hoe to sight on one side.

494
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,240
 Rosie's on the river street.

495
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,320
 Hey, I'd seen that on my tablet back in Manitoba.

496
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,200
 It got good trip adviser reviews.

497
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,080
 And indeed it had an attractive air with plenty of tables outside and people tucking

498
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,640
 into meals at them.

499
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,080
 I found a parking lot that would become free in ten minutes.

500
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,360
 I could have paid or chanced it but again I was in no rush.

501
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,200
 I waited for the clock to tip to the end of pay parking and stroll back up the street

502
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
 to Rosie's.

503
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,920
 I wanted a beer and a beer deal and unhorriedly enjoyed them both at an outside table, watching

504
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,480
 moose JVians pass by and admiring the local architecture.

505
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,880
 I was tempted to order a second beer from their class of redesigned pint glasses but

506
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,880
 providing a sell but I still needed to find a hotel before I could stop driving for the

507
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
 evening.

508
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,640
 I could walk his walk back after I checked in, right?

509
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,280
 For shattering.

510
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:20,440
 I pulled out my tablet to check the address of my hotel and nearly spat out a wasteful

511
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,280
 mouthful of that excellent beer.

512
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,160
 I had, in a moment of inattention, booked myself into a hotel, not in moose JVian, but in

513
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,040
 medicine had 250 miles away.

514
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:37,840
 Four hours per the westward and it was already past seven o'clock in the evening.

515
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
 Oh no.

516
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,840
 The sip of beer I hadn't spat out suddenly tasted flat and sour in my mouth and at that

517
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,040
 point I shall break off this extract.

518
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
 No.

519
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,840
 But what happens now Sandra?

520
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,800
 Oh no but what happens?

521
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,640
 We don't know what happens.

522
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
 It's a cliffhanger.

523
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,640
 Leave me sitting there in moose, you're on a cliffhanger.

524
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,440
 So find out what happens next.

525
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,040
 You will have to read the next bit of my report.

526
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,720
 Ah, well fair enough.

527
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,840
 You know how to leave them wanting more.

528
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,960
 Choose your own adventure.

529
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,400
 So yes that was great.

530
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
 Thank you very much.

531
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
 Yeah no very good.

532
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,360
 We'll wait till we hear the next.

533
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,600
 So the next, where are you publishing this extract?

534
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,280
 Where should we expect to see it?

535
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,200
 The full chapter of which you've just heard an extract, this has not quite been analysed

536
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,840
 but definitely yet but I would be going to appear in the fanzine beam from Nick Farrie

537
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,640
 and Ulrich O'Brien.

538
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,760
 If he doesn't appear there then they are so big to get a chapter but I'm expecting that

539
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,240
 this will be this one.

540
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
 Fair enough.

541
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
 Excellent.

542
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,440
 But if you want to keep up to date with anything to do with the Transatlantic Fan Fund

543
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,440
 or my report or anything else that's appitates to it, go to TAF.org.

544
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,280
 .uk and you will find everything that you need to know and probably some stuff that

545
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
 you didn't.

546
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,080
 How's it good we're putting it?

547
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,520
 TAF.org.uk is presumably run by Mr Langford.

548
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,600
 Indeed Dave Langford is one of long term heroes.

549
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,040
 He was the TAF winner in 1980.

550
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,880
 Is that right?

551
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,040
 A long, long time ago.

552
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,320
 The Galaxy far, far away.

553
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,600
 I can still remember when that music...

554
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,400
 Yes, but we have.

555
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,360
 He has been doing great things for TAF.

556
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,120
 He has on that site, many of them written by Rob Hansen a few of them not.

557
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,920
 Yes, there are lots and lots of really excellent books and actually a few rubbish ones but

558
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,600
 you know, you can't have everything can you?

559
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,840
 No, lots of extremely good, fan-ish content there. Some of the very best collections of

560
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,560
 fandom anywhere are available for free download in exchange for a donation to TAF.

561
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,960
 Yes, and Sandra was indeed correct.

562
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,920
 Dave Langford did indeed win TAF in 1980.

563
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:11,840
 I will also mention whilst we're talking about the chat that his trip report, which is the

564
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:18,400
 TAF transatlantic hearing aid, is one of the absolute paragons of the genre and it's

565
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,040
 one to which I had frequent reference when planning mine.

566
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,080
 I will not set myself up as being able to write half as wittliest Dave but in my own

567
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,360
 little way I'm trying.

568
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,520
 Very trying.

569
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,760
 The oldies are the goodies.

570
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,600
 Excellent stuff. Thank you very much for reading out and I will look forward to appearing

571
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,440
 in Beam.

572
00:34:49,440 --> 00:35:01,120
 Do we want to have a chat about fanfums generally and I guess the big question is why are fanfums

573
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,920
 still relevant here in 2023?

574
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,720
 We can get on zoom and chat to people all over the world.

575
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,880
 We have hundreds or thousands of people attending conventions across the Atlantic.

576
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,240
 Why is it still a good idea to have a fanfund?

577
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,240
 Well, I can give you an answer whether it's the answer I don't know.

578
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,440
 I think there are as with most things in fandom there are several interlocking causes and

579
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
 reasons.

580
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:32,840
 But fanfums have been going, as I mentioned earlier, for a long, long time, for longer

581
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,360
 than any of us have been in fandom.

582
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,120
 That's the saying goes, once something's been done twice in fandom it's a tradition.

583
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,880
 So after something's been done in fandom for 50 times, well, it's absolutely graven in

584
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,520
 snow, isn't it?

585
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,920
 I do think that this is partly being flippant but I do think there is also the aspect that

586
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,160
 nobody wants to be the administrator who says, well, isn't it about time that we wrap this

587
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,920
 up because everyone who wants to have won this fund has already won it.

588
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,000
 I don't think that's the case at all, just to clarify.

589
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:15,520
 Yeah, I think from my part, my answer is that as long as people want to stand and as long

590
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,120
 as people want to vote, then it'll keep going.

591
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,880
 And in some ways I think the question of why is almost a bit by the bike because I'm

592
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,080
 not interested in telling people they've got to stop.

593
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,280
 I mean, I don't think they should stop.

594
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,560
 I think it's good that they do it.

595
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,880
 But even if you don't, they're going to do it anyway.

596
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,400
 Fansons, I'm speaking here for TAF in particular, which, you know, because it's the one that

597
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,720
 I, you know, had the one who I'm currently trying to juggle things for, go back to the

598
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:53,080
 time when transatlantic travel was not just the sort of thing you could just whip out

599
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,640
 a credit card and book a flight.

600
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:02,520
 The first two TAF delegates travelled by ocean ship and not talking at sort of luxury crews

601
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
 here.

602
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,440
 We're talking, you know, they sort of sprung into a cabin on a sort of tramp steamer type

603
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,960
 thing and got across on the cheap.

604
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
 Yeah.

605
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,840
 Fund them around the world, you know, used to be almost entirely conducted by mail between

606
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:23,120
 North America and Europe and Europe and Australia and Australia and North America.

607
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:29,040
 And obviously there was a great deal of enthusiasm back in the early days for members of one

608
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,480
 fandom to meet representative members of another.

609
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,880
 And I do think that is still the case.

610
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,720
 Even though, you know, it's so much easier to make a trip onto your own steam these days,

611
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,080
 there is still something about being a TAF delegate or a Gough delegate or any, yeah, any

612
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,800
 fan fund delegate where it's not just an honor, but you, but it also means you get to represent

613
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,960
 the fandom that you've come from and you get to tell people about it in convention programming

614
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,840
 and social belier and it helps to bind fandom closer together.

615
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,600
 And obviously, fandom is a great deal, larger and more disparate and diverse now than it

616
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,360
 was in the earliest days of fan funds.

617
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,040
 But, you know, it's like the app that's had two new heads and three new handles.

618
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
 It's still fandom.

619
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
 Yeah.

620
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
 Yeah, that's fair.

621
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
 Very much so.

622
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,680
 That's a good way of putting it.

623
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,240
 I think it does help to bring fandom together.

624
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,000
 I certainly did a lot of zooms in 2020 that had a lot of fans from both Europe and Australia

625
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 at them.

626
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,800
 And these people hadn't met before though.

627
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,320
 There were often people that they had contacted online and they knew the names of, but they

628
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,800
 were seeing on Zoom for the first time.

629
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,320
 When I went out, obviously, I met a lot of people for the first time, including many people

630
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,880
 that had just been legends to me like, like Robert Johnson and Lee Evans, who's now a

631
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,840
 correspondent throughout the book, of course.

632
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,240
 But also in at least one city, I organized gatherings and there were people there who

633
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,240
 didn't know each other because I'd just kind of reached out to everyone I knew in that

634
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,000
 city and some of them, they weren't necessarily moving in the same bits of fandom.

635
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,800
 They were all people I happen to know from all the various different things that I've

636
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
 done.

637
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,240
 So, I mean, I think it's just, it's one of the things that basically says, in a very public

638
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,280
 way, fandom is a community and this is these trips are one of the ways that we celebrate

639
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,160
 the fact that it's a global community of people.

640
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,960
 It is not just about adulating the people who are writing books and making TV shows,

641
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,160
 it is also about getting together with other fans because those people are interesting

642
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
 in their own right.

643
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
 Yeah.

644
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,920
 And by the same token, Alison, you know, @Pemicon, which you'll be able to read in the chapter

645
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:44,320
 in idea, I met a couple of people from Las Vegas who were grumbling that they didn't know

646
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,560
 with any other fans in Las Vegas.

647
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
 Wow.

648
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:57,160
 Oh, I said, have you spoken to the right person, I said, in another week's time, those two

649
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,560
 were invited to an attended the TAF party in Las Vegas and met all the Las Vegas fans

650
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,760
 that I already knew.

651
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:11,400
 TAFs and other fans do still serve to introduce people who ought to know each other but somehow

652
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,200
 haven't met yet.

653
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,440
 This is why Spaniel and I have started the Newcastle First Thursday group because I think

654
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,880
 this is one of the things that in-person meetings still do best.

655
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,200
 Even locally is there's a chap who has started coming to that called Andy.

656
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,960
 Hello, Andy, if you're listening.

657
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,760
 And you know, he doesn't know anyone else who would be up for going to a convention.

658
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,760
 Like he knows other science fiction nerds but they're not particularly fussed about the

659
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,840
 idea of going to a con but now he knows us all and a lot of us go to cons.

660
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,600
 If he goes to a con he'll have people there he recognizes because I think going to a convention

661
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,200
 where you know you'll know literally no one is very daunting or going to a gathering where

662
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,440
 you know where you know you will know literally no one but trying to do those smaller more

663
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,800
 low key gatherings is a good way of trying to overcome that I think.

664
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,960
 So I think there's a lot here as it were.

665
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:14,480
 But the thing about so much of fandom happening in an online or a virtual environment these

666
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,200
 days is that it is actually possible in a way that it was a lot harder to be in the past

667
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,920
 to be in a city or an urban area where there are all of other fancies but you just don't

668
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,040
 happen ever to have come across them.

669
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,640
 Yeah, yeah, baby up.

670
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,880
 And yeah and all three of us who obviously have all been cast or current fan fund delegates

671
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,400
 you know we've all just given our own examples of this kind of thing.

672
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,200
 So yes fan funds are one of the specimens of glue that helps to bind fandom together.

673
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,080
 Like the poly cement of fandom.

674
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:58,000
 Basically hanging out with people is good.

675
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,200
 Shall we do pics?

676
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
 Oddly enough.

677
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:11,480
 Yeah, I dropped a hint earlier that TAF has amongst its many attractions on TAF.org.uk

678
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:18,080
 a slew of e-books which you can download in return for a donation.

679
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,640
 The newest one of these is going to be my pick for the episode.

680
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,240
 It is called Beyond fandom.

681
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,960
 Films, culture and politics in the 20th century edited by Rob Hanson for it is he.

682
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,200
 Now I must say that that subtitle makes it sad to be an academic book which I think does

683
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
 it know favours.

684
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,200
 But on the other hand, yeah it does pretty much sum up.

685
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,640
 Basically what Rob has done in this book is taken over two dozen fans from the earliest

686
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,800
 days of fandom up until the turn of the current century.

687
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,440
 All of whom became famous for something other than what you might expect a science fiction

688
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,080
 fan to become famous for.

689
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,160
 So for instance Michael Moorcock and Robert Silverberg aren't in the book because tons

690
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,840
 of fans have become professional science fiction writers after having started off in

691
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
 fandom.

692
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:19,800
 But what he has dog up are people who've achieved fame outside this.

693
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,400
 So there's one of America's leading jazz journalists.

694
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:30,960
 There was the editor and publisher of America's first ever lesbian magazine.

695
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,480
 There was the guy who founded the newspaper Mersey Beat which had John Lennon writing a

696
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,240
 column for it immediately before the Beatles suddenly became worldwide famous.

697
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:49,920
 The founders of C&D, the musicians, the music mogul, the guy who promoted early comic bands,

698
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,920
 the Pope's astronomer.

699
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,800
 Did you know that the Pope's astronomer was a science fiction fan?

700
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,720
 Well I've had dinner with him.

701
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,240
 Oh wow listen you've always got to wallop be havin' you.

702
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,040
 But I mean but brother guy does come to conventions you should keep an eye out for him at them.

703
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,880
 He's very entertaining and interesting.

704
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,200
 But yes but yeah this book Rob has written large chunks of it.

705
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:22,360
 There are also as often with Rob's books fairly hefty chunks from period forces to prove that

706
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,840
 this is actually here what was written about it at the time.

707
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,680
 It's in 31 different chapters so it's the sort of book you dip in and out of at the

708
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,240
 measure and that is my pick for the episodes recommendation.

709
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,640
 Lovely stuff.

710
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,120
 I shall have to look out for that.

711
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,920
 So the three books is generally a very good thing, there are so many things on there that

712
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:51,840
 it can be a bit daunting so it's good to have a sort of window or a way in that's a bit

713
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,000
 more accessible than just the entire wall of titles.

714
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,520
 Alison do you want to do your pick?

715
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,880
 Yes so my pick I don't think I have been, so people have been saying to me for approximately

716
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,800
 four seasons now Alison you really should be watching For All Mankind because it is

717
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,560
 right up your street and I've been going oh yes I'm going to get round to it and I have

718
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,880
 now got round to it and for those people who have been watching the glacial pace at which

719
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,960
 we watched the expanse I should say that on current viewing speed we are going to catch

720
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,080
 up with the latest episode of For All Mankind in less than a week.

721
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,200
 So it clearly is hitting a nerve for me.

722
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:41,640
 I'm one of these people who thinks that historical dramas about space exploration are not science

723
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:49,960
 fictioners should not appear on science fiction award ballots but this is an alt historical

724
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:56,480
 drama about space travelers so it's completely fine it is obviously science fiction and it

725
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,840
 is for people who don't know an alternative history where as a result of a change this

726
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:10,400
 happens in the mid 60s the Soviet space program is just a little bit more effective than it

727
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,880
 was in reality and as a result of that the space race continues with some verb much for

728
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:24,120
 much longer than it did in our timeline and the creator Ron Moore is the was the creator

729
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,200
 of Bratislav Galactica the reboot and he read an interview with him where or listen to an

730
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,760
 interview with him where he said that people of his sort of age which is also my sort of

731
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,560
 age because we are very nearly the same age have an existential tragedy in our lives this

732
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,140
 is nerds of our age in that we grew up believing that there was going to be a massive space

733
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,000
 exploration program and that we were just witnessing the start of it and that it didn't

734
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,520
 happen so this is really a television show about what might happen if that tragedy had

735
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:59,600
 been averted and a space program does happen and obviously there's quite a lot of other

736
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:04,240
 stuff going on in the show it is not merely a space exploration show every time you read

737
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,560
 a Reddit thread about this show there are people there going this would be a much better show

738
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:15,680
 if they cut out all the messy people stuff and just had the space stuff and the space danger

739
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,480
 we like space danger that is what we watch for and there is plenty of space danger but there's

740
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,400
 also a lot of ordinary drama plots some of which are ramped up quite a lot so they are

741
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,760
 they tend to be very high stakes drama and it feels a bit like extremely excessive soap opera

742
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,280
 sometimes that you see that is that a or tone of allers that a development happens and you go

743
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,000
 well that is absolutely bananas that you know in order for that to happen so many people have

744
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,360
 to have done things that are very stupid and like any television show the writing is not always

745
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,120
 in some episodes the writing is absolutely acting and everything is absolutely first rated in

746
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:59,280
 other episodes you go oh they kind of didn't quite deliver enough to let us believe that moment so

747
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:07,200
 it is not perfect but it is generally amazing and I'm absolutely loving it it's like catnip for me

748
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:14,080
 I love all the there's a point very early on where there's Apollo 11 and and you realize that

749
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:21,120
 this is an alternative history they might not land safely and you go oh oh wait you know he

750
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:28,000
 may be about to kill them all off gosh you you intrigued me Allison you know I never watch anything

751
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,720
 on television oh it's great yeah in part because I have sort of agnosia which makes it rather

752
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,120
 awkward for me to keep track of which character is which but you actually you know made this sound

753
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,480
 so interesting but I may have to give you to go if any if any if if Allison says that something has

754
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:52,240
 verb then verb in jolly well has is my experience it has it also has time skips so the first series

755
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:58,880
 starts in 1969 and carries on to I think about 1974 and then the second series skips forward to

756
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,640
 about 1995 and then the third series is the early 80s so you see he's kind of catching up in the

757
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,960
 same way as I'm catching up with his show so and I have watched always the end of season three as

758
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,880
 season three's finale was shocking but then so was season two's finale season one's finale so you

759
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,640
 know you keep going well how are they gonna top this and as I said sometimes it's sometimes it's

760
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:28,960
 over the top so sometimes it does go it it has moments that's strange credulity hang on science

761
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,400
 fiction where credulity is strained that seems very unlikely but it's funny because my just

762
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,360
 my disbelief suspenders never snap when they're kind of exploring or whatever but they do snap

763
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,240
 when it's kind of and here is the way that this relationship between these two people has progressed

764
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:53,600
 and I'm like oh no that doesn't make any sense I mean I would say I think so I do think there is

765
00:49:53,600 --> 00:50:00,880
 a common misconception that relationships between people make sense because I do often see people

766
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,840
 complaining about things and I'm like I have relationships in my life that make less sense to that

767
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:12,000
 yes no well indeed and I think one of the things that this show makes me think about is that most of

768
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,320
 us have experiences in our past that could have been absolutely catastrophic for one reason or

769
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:27,600
 another and because we were probably lucky they weren't or you know they were really somewhat yeah

770
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,640
 and one of the things that happens to this show is that some things that are the sorts of things

771
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:39,040
 that people actually do in real life quite often they just kind of explore the natural consequences

772
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,480
 of that and its cat and because Ron Moore designed the entire series before he started he went to

773
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,040
 Apple and said give me a ton of money and I'll make you some six seasons maybe seven you know

774
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,960
 and he's got a plan and so we've just got to the end of season three and there is something that

775
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,640
 has happened at the end of season three in this final episode and it's like oh that's why that

776
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:07,200
 character had that name and you go so at the point where they were designing the show and casting

777
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:13,840
 people they've clearly got this beat in the show planned in three seasons down the line where they

778
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,760
 were going to go oh right and this is a parrot because this is an alternate universe parallel with

779
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,920
 something that happened in our timeline so they weren't all just making it up as they went along

780
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:28,480
 indeed but to an amazing degree and that and even even good television actually doesn't often do

781
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,520
 this as well as it ought to do so and the other point I wanted to say about it is it's on Apple TV

782
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,320
 plus I know I keep saying this I've been saying for god knows how many episodes that Apple TV

783
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:45,120
 plus is a five or a month it turns out it's not it's 8.99 sorry guys apparently apparently inflation

784
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:50,640
 happened and prices went up when I wasn't looking no it's a very good show I have I'm behind

785
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,520
 because I find it very difficult to watch but it is very good and I do enjoy it it is it is petrified

786
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:03,840
 I mean bits of it are real behind the sofa stuff um happy anniversary dr who yes behind the

787
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:10,080
 behind the sofa stuff for grownups yes that actually the seed I'm mostly thinking of that I really

788
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:16,160
 wanted to be able to turn the TV off and not watch was set on earth didn't involve any spacecraft

789
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:25,840
 I am going to not I'm gonna I'm gonna spin off something you said in your or you you don't think

790
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:31,920
 historical drama about space travel is science fiction or you you say it's not

791
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,920
 fanny and I have been recently talking about this and I think that space travel is so wrapped up in

792
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,680
 the history of the genre that it kind of got grandfathered in in that it doesn't really make any sense

793
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,360
 that people consider it part of the genre but it very definitely still feels like it is

794
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:55,120
 well do you remember john or the kafuffel when Apollo 13 came out and people kept trying to

795
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:00,400
 nominate it for for the awards and so the science in the science fiction genre and people and

796
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,160
 other people were saying but it's not science fiction it's a documentary and like I say I mean

797
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,680
 I can see the point but equally I can see the point but equally I do think that space travel did

798
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,200
 eventually get sort of grandfathered into the genre because it is so so wrapped up with the early

799
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:24,960
 early science fiction all this to say that my pick is a city on Mars by Kelly and Zach Wienerschmith

800
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,960
 if you've heard of Zach Wienersmith he is the person who draws Saturday morning breakfast cereal

801
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:39,520
 which is a webcomic and Kelly is his wife and is a noted bacteriologist I think a biologist of

802
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,600
 some description if Liz was here should be annoyed that I don't know but she's not so I can run free

803
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:52,800
 and they've written a book about space settlement and it is it is absolutely excellent and I will be

804
00:53:52,800 --> 00:54:02,000
 probably nominating it in best related work because it is a very good look at what it would take to

805
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,800
 get to the sort of future that for instance for all mankind is positing and exploring some of

806
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,960
 the issues with that partly the issues in terms of like the physics but also issues

807
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:22,480
 that are a bit more esoteric and perhaps aren't quite as well considered by the sort of space nerd

808
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,400
 that tends to talk about these things for instance the I mean starting with the biology of it all

809
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:36,160
 but then moving on to things like the considerations of international space law and how that would

810
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:44,240
 affect these things and it's just really really interesting and I really loved it so I devoured it

811
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:52,720
 and I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in in you know our future in the stars

812
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,480
 well possibly you know put it back there of put your copy up for sales the Taff and

813
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,600
 written that you know it's because it advertised as being having John Cox's genuine back marks

814
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:12,160
 you desire it yeah no I'm happy to buy to book and then put it on to put it on sale

815
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,040
 but it does mean that if I ever die there's like a record all my teeth look like so that's

816
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,760
 probably useful don't you go to the dentist regularly well yeah but I don't know if they know what my

817
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,080
 teeth look like do you think they've made a model yeah teeth teeth are like a light bullet

818
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:34,000
 every every one fingerprints everyone has their own unique you know bite mark indeed indeed yes

819
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:47,280
 can I can I can I can I can I jump one more small piece in and before we wrap everything up

820
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:55,040
 this is something that I've been reminded of by total happenstance because somebody has just

821
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:02,240
 post-poked I'll name him it's Nigel Rose just posted about it the very very first British

822
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:10,240
 transatlantic fan for the winner was a fan called Vince Clark he he was the winner in 1954

823
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:15,840
 unfortunately he lost his job at a crucial time and because the fan from was only very new

824
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,960
 that meant he come before to go and Vince never made it to America

825
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:28,640
 in 1987 Vince was one of the first fans I met when I was when I discovered found them

826
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,920
 and did more than any other fans probably to make sure that I actually stayed around

827
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,320
 I think it's fair to say that without him I wouldn't be sitting here doing this recording with you today

828
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:46,640
 and that's it happens today marks the 25th anniversary to the day of Vince's death

829
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,040
 and I just want to say I don't know what Vince was made of the whole concept of the podcast

830
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:58,960
 but I you know I think it's entirely in keeping that you know that we give the man a mention he

831
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,200
 was the loveliest man ever I I would second that and in fact when I did my very first fanzine

832
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,720
 which was the sort of rather pathetic krodsine that that people do when they do their very first

833
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,800
 fanzine before we started doing plotter Vince wrote me an extremely lovely letter saying how

834
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:23,280
 much he'd enjoyed it which I took which greatly encouraged me at the time but of course a long time

835
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,400
 later I could go well I'm actually Vince was very good at I'd say that to all of the new

836
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:34,640
 fanlets and I'm sure that he would be equally enthusiastic about about podcasts and other

837
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,720
 modern things of fandom because he was indeed a very very lovely person

838
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,520
 it's very very grateful for that letter which did indeed encourage me to do fanzines

839
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:49,120
 yeah thanks for letting me jam that in Alison and John 25 years I know he doesn't seem possible

840
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:57,120
 time in it times we can get to chariot yada yada one day you'll have somebody older than me on the

841
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:03,360
 podcast if there are any left but today is not that day I'm not that much younger than you

842
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,360
 I don't think you're that much younger than me but I think you are younger than me to be fair

843
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,960
 I think next time we record we'll have someone older than you on the pod

844
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:16,080
 what me you mean me yeah yeah because you'll be older oh thank you Sean that's helpful
