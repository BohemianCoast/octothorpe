00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 53rd episode of Octa Thorpe, the podcast for Science Fiction

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,600
 and Science Fiction fandom. I'm John Coxon and you may be able to tell that my voice is slightly

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:21,280
 different to usual and that's because I have managed to catch COVID in the same week that I

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,400
 moved house, which is just 10/10 planning on my part. I think I have absolutely nailed it.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,920
 As a result, we're dropping this little mini episode to keep you all tidied over until we

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:44,320
 release a proper episode again a fortnight today and this is the chat we had when we were answering

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:52,720
 Coribulat's questions about our fancast and we linked to that post on her blog and this is the

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,880
 chat we had that went into answering those questions. So I hope people enjoy it and we'll see you all

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:17,920
 in a fortnight's time. Tell us about your podcast or channel. It was John's idea. Octa Thorpe has a

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,880
 tagline, the podcast of science fiction and science fiction fandom and we do talk about science

11
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,400
 fiction, a fair amount, but we do talk a lot about fandom, about upcoming conventions, about things

12
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,800
 that fans do and that is I think where our heart is and we also have a very engaged community

13
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,000
 who write it and tell us what they think about all of these things and we are very pleased about that.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,120
 Yeah, so I think we could probably do like the first three questions because the other ones are

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,440
 who are the people behind it and why did you decide to start? So I think, so I decided to start

16
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,240
 a podcast and I recorded, I actually recorded a pilot episode of a podcast with Meg Frank back

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,840
 in 2013, which never, never actually made it. That's a long time ago. I knew I wanted it to be about

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,920
 fandom and I knew I wanted it to be in the style of the Apple Tech podcasts that I love and I eventually

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,320
 discovered that Alison also loves the Apple Tech podcasts that I love and so I said Alison do you

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,200
 want to be on a podcast because you're quite loud and then I knew that Liz was a good egg and I wasn't

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,840
 talking to Liz as much because she had gone to Thailand and I was like Liz is good, she's more

22
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,560
 sensible than me and Alison, she has more reasonable opinions and she will be a good moderating

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,000
 influence on the two of us and so I asked Liz how did that work out for you? I think it's gone very

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,560
 well and maybe I was just ruminating, I went down to get my water and I was thinking that was a really

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,320
 good episode, I really liked talking to Alison and Liz every two weeks and I really like getting to

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,960
 listen to it again when I edited it and they made me laugh and I very much enjoy, I very much enjoy

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,840
 my Sunday mornings and yes so I think it is good. I have been wanting to do a podcast ever since

28
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,920
 the very beginning of podcasts but it turned out that if you want to do a podcast you have to find

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,760
 someone who's dumb enough to do the editing for you. That's fair because otherwise podcasts don't

30
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,680
 happen, so if you want to run on your own podcast the core thing you need is somebody who's up for

31
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
 doing the editing which is significantly more work than recording the podcast. It doesn't take longer

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,080
 but it's just not as much fun. Once you get into a swing of it I think it takes roughly twice as

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,760
 much time as the recording length for the style of editing what you do, so it isn't about three

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,920
 hours probably to edit each episode. Liz tell us about your deep-seated longing to be on a podcast.

35
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,400
 I didn't have any time to be on a podcast or to start a podcast or really to really work around

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,640
 podcasts but John was like do you want to do a podcast? I think I was like maybe and then there

37
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,680
 was a coronavirus and so it's like well now I literally have nothing else that I need to be doing

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,400
 on a Sunday afternoon so let's do a podcast and I am just constantly amazed that we have made it

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,520
 42 episodes and there appear to be at least 10 people actually listening. One of the things it says

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,280
 is what format and I would quite like to speak to that one so yeah go for Alison why do we do this

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,880
 format? What format did you choose for your podcast or channel and why did you choose this format?

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,320
 So there are quite a lot of podcasts out there for science fiction in particular and none of them

43
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:38,160
 quite did what I liked in terms of the sort of podcasts I like to listen to because John mentioned

44
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,200
 Apple podcasts and indeed their Apple podcast but they are podcasts where a bunch of mates

45
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:52,240
 get together every so often and chew the fat about current things going on in the area they're

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,680
 interested in and those are the sorts of podcasts I like and none of the other science fiction

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,560
 podcasts were quite doing that and critically the sort of podcast this isn't it's not really an

48
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,680
 interview podcast so a lot of podcasts involve the host interviewing different people each week so

49
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,200
 it's not that sort of podcast it's the sort of podcast where people chat about things it is

50
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:19,120
 explicitly modeled on a couple of Apple tech podcasts except unlike those podcasts there are

51
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,440
 women on this one ha ha ha that was that was definitely something I did also want to make sure

52
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,480
 I did I did not want to be another white dude podcast I think there are probably enough of

53
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,560
 those already and I'm one of the things one of the things I really loved about that style of

54
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,960
 podcast was how discursive it was and I thought that really tied into the letters of comment

55
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,160
 from kind of old school fanzine fandom and so that was kind of one of the reasons why I thought

56
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,240
 the format would work in a fanist context was that I thought it actually harped back to fan writing

57
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,800
 in an older sense and I didn't really think it was something that was happening in in fanish

58
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,360
 podcasting so yeah the fan categories are the heroes were there at the very beginning but they

59
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,120
 are also the categories which consistently get the lowest number of roots and nominations so why

60
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,000
 do you think fanzines castes and other fan products are important Alison probably has the strongest

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,640
 opinions I'm a fan of science fiction fandom as much as I am a fan of science fiction if I look

62
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,080
 at my reading and my watching some of it is genre as much of it is not but if I look at the people I

63
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,000
 choose to spend time with their science fiction fans that it's actually the community of fandom

64
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:37,520
 that I find so valuable and the thing about fan cut about fanzines about fan writing about fan

65
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,040
 castes it's very much the forefront of what they're doing that they are actually celebrating

66
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,600
 the thoughts of the people who like this stuff which is the stuff that I found interesting

67
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,280
 and that's why whenever I'm looking at conventions I'm like let's talk about how we manage all the

68
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,400
 things that aren't the program how we how we make sure that the social spaces are engineered right

69
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,480
 because it's the social interactions between fandom that are what I'm here for and this is what

70
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,240
 is known traditionally as being a fake fan that is fair that had scare quotes on it by the way

71
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:16,000
 fair enough because obviously it's the most real fandom of all yeah I think and I think like I got

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,600
 into frontom largely through kind of zzz at nine but also like one of the early fandoms I was in

73
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,840
 was fanzine fandom so I think for me it kind of was just how I came into fandom to a large extent

74
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,880
 so I think that's probably why I think it's important it's just it's where I came from when I wrote a

75
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,920
 fanzine between 2007 and 2014 ish called procrastination which I recently published a new issue of

76
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,600
 and so yeah I think it's I always liked and I like reading blogs and stuff as well and I like reading

77
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,040
 kind of Twitter and Facebook as as fan writing has evolved I have enjoyed interacting with it

78
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,360
 I want to say two things which is I think is very nice that the hugos from the start have

79
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,040
 rewarded kind of fan endeavors alongside the professional ones and I think it's nice to have

80
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,840
 them there also so that people who maybe are not as familiar with fandom might at some point

81
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
 look at the list of hugo winners and go oh fanzines fan cats maybe I should check some of these out

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,680
 but also I think as long as there is a vibrant community I'm not particularly bothered if they

83
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,320
 get fewer votes and nominations than other categories I mean I think it's nice that they're there for

84
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,720
 people but I don't necessarily worry that there aren't as many people nominating for best fanzines

85
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,240
 there are for best novel or best short story I think they are just aiming at a slightly nisha

86
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,480
 segment of fandom I don't want to get too low because I do want like the hugos to be to maintain

87
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,560
 some prestige and I think if you get to point where you know you only need five nominations to get

88
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,480
 on the ballot then that is too low I mean there is there is a built-in thing in the hugo rules that if

89
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,080
 the number of votes ever drops too low that there will will be you know no award in that category

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,040
 so I think there is that built-in at least so it never falls low a certain threshold and I do

91
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,360
 want to see it kind of you know maintain a good level of interest but I'm not necessarily bothered

92
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,960
 that it's that it's lower than it is in some of the other categories I'm going to make that sound

93
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,360
 snappier when I edit it that's a good thing. In the last 20 years fanzines have increasingly

94
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,920
 moved online and fancasts have sprung up or do you think the future of fan media looks like?

95
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,040
 I have opinions on this as as some people may know one of the reasons I wanted to do a podcast

96
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,720
 was because I thought that the sort of style of fanzine I quite like with the focus on fandom

97
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,000
 is something that I feel like hasn't really made the jump to more modern media which is a problem

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
 for me because I enjoy more modern media and I completely respect there are fanzine fans who

99
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,800
 are like very into their printed materials and PDFs but like as someone who enjoys that style of

100
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,160
 writing but enjoys more modern forms quite like some of it to be available in those more modern

101
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,880
 forms and so I do three fanzines one of which is I experimented with kind of doing e-pubs and stuff

102
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,720
 fairly early on and now is a blog one is an email newsletter and the other is a podcast and I think

103
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,160
 especially email newsletters are currently blowing up with sub-stack and stuff there's a lot of good

104
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,680
 fan writing you can get like delivered to you now. I think the future is going to be in kind of

105
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,280
 using these new technologies that come up stuff like email newsletters which are very old in some

106
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,760
 ways but have had a renaissance and I think people have noticed that this is actually a fantastic

107
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,320
 way of doing it but also using stuff like WordPress and using kind of YouTube and podcast platforms

108
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
 to do this stuff will be very popular in the future and that's where because I'm trying to

109
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
 skate to where I think the buck is heading and that's been what I've been trying to do in my fan act

110
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,040
 throughout. So I think the last 20 years I've seen a massive fragmentation of the sort of

111
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,280
 fandom I like which people bemoan quite a bit but but one of the problems is that I don't think the

112
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:57,040
 most of the older fans who were used to doing paper fanzines have found it very easy to engage

113
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,720
 with with the more modern things. I also think there's a problem with so the thing about paper

114
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,360
 fanzines is that you can pick up a paper fanzine from many years ago say on a table at a convention

115
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,120
 and you're suddenly transported into the life of these people and a lot of the things we've been

116
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:23,200
 using now for our fanish links and communications have been much more ephemeral than fanzines so it

117
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,040
 would be quite nice to have some things that are not so ephemeral. Now people may decide in the future

118
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,280
 why would anybody listen to a podcast from 2021 but they might not, ultimately they might go,

119
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,600
 "oh what were people thinking? What were they saying?" People did go back and listen to some of the

120
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,320
 earlier episodes of OctaThorp before this Easter were like, "oh apparently you have been bleating

121
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,640
 on about this for a year." So you know there's something about what all the time fans even fans

122
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,960
 call time binding about making things that have a degree of permanence and I'm slightly struggling.

123
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,880
 I too have an email newsletter which is not getting around to doing its third issue at the moment

124
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,720
 but it will do quite soon and one of the reasons it's not is that it had a, I wanted to put a lot

125
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,920
 of links in in the first two and I did and then I realised that links start rotting immediately

126
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,880
 so you immediately lose the permanence of your item and I'm thinking about what more I can do

127
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,680
 about that to keep a sense of permanence about the stuff that I do. I want that in the future in the

128
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,400
 event anyone cares there will be something there for them to care about. Yes I think what I've noticed

129
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,480
 is maybe it's not coming, it's not coming I think out of the sort of more traditional historical

130
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,760
 fanzine fans but there's a lot of people on YouTube talking about books and a lot of them have

131
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,280
 pretty big audiences and a lot of viewership and there's definitely kind of an audience out there

132
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:50,080
 and I wonder if more and more will sort of drift towards that video model. Booktube they call it.

133
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,160
 It's basically Booktube yes. That's not for Korra who knows this perfectly well but for our listeners

134
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,040
 Booktubes maybe you think they haven't come across so we should probably talk about at some point.

135
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,640
 Email, you know email newsletters are an extremely throwbacky idea which has come around again

136
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,480
 so maybe the next thing is going to be like a live journal revival or something. Who knows?

137
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,400
 Or it'll be a completely different set of media that we haven't even invented yet.

138
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,720
 Yes I think that may indeed be the thing.
