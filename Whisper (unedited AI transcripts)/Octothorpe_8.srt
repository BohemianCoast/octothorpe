1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
 You could just put it on git or something and we could all simultaneously edit it and push it back.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:17,680
 Yes! The best! We should have a git reef over the showdotes. Absolutely. I love that.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,280
 That's hilarious. Because we're not actually a tech podcast. I just feel that sharing text files

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,920
 on the internet should be simpler than this. I mean, I feel like your computer shouldn't be

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,160
 haunted, Alison. But like, we work with what we've got. Honestly, as it taunted. Um...

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,320
 I mean, none of the evidence supports that perspective. Definitely haunted.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:59,760
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very eighth episode of the OctaThorp podcast, a podcast for

8
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,920
 science fiction and science fiction fandom. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Betty.

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:16,000
 And we have a raft of letters of comment this week. We're very sorry. We did not correctly set up

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,400
 our email forwarding and that means that we had inadvertently ignored all emails for the last two

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,720
 months. So we've got a lot to talk about. And thanks very much to listener Claire Breiley of

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,560
 Croydon who pointed this out to us helpfully. Also, when you say we felt as head of our email,

13
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,080
 John. I'm blaming John. I mean, to be fair, none of us checks and we probably should have done.

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,080
 It's true. I probably should not just blame John. We'll can leave that bit out. I will not blame

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,520
 John personally for our rudeness. But for other things. Ha ha ha. It's probably mostly life home.

16
00:01:52,160 --> 00:02:00,560
 Right then. So from the top, our first email of comment was on the 13th of April 2020,

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,520
 which at the time of recording is two months and four days ago. And it is from one Andrew January

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:16,640
 of Reading. And he says that he came across a website that does special video chat. And you move

19
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,920
 around in a 2D space. And as you get near people, you can have group video chats with them.

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:29,440
 And it lets you kind of treat a big group gathering on the internet as a kind of space rather than

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,280
 just to kind of set of rooms as in Zoom or a set of channels as in Discord. He doesn't mention

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,120
 what the name of the website was. We did talk about something a little bit similar to this last

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,840
 episode, which was color. But yeah, that sounds cool. Wouldn't it be cool if it was 3D and you could

24
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,320
 do it in VR on your VR headset? That would be awesome. I have been very sad to not discover.

25
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,800
 I was expecting to go into the Oculus Store and find all manner of VR experiences of this kind.

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,000
 But they don't appear to exist yet. I don't really want to spend an entire evening with my VR headset

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,920
 on much as I love it. It's quite heavy and not entirely conducive. And it would be hard to like

28
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,400
 drink one of the things I do on these Zoom chats is drink. And I cannot drink and play Oculus Quest

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,520
 at the same time. I would need to drink my beer with a straw. And you know there that gets you.

30
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,160
 I think we did on a previous podcast. I think Liz suggested one of those beer hats.

31
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,160
 I was going to suggest that again because it's such a good idea. A VR headset with integrated

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:44,400
 beer hat. I may need one of these. Yes? I'm going to be a billionaire. If Andrew has seen this thing,

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,080
 has he actually seen it used for a large event? Because I feel like there's a number of people

34
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,200
 saying, well, there's a proof of concept of these things. But I'm not sure to what extent

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,280
 they actually exist. And also whether they're actually being used for large events or whether

36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,240
 they're just kind of tech demos. I'm also slightly worried that the problem we've talked about before

37
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,160
 that it's very, it's relatively easy in a physical conversation to say this is amazing,

38
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:17,200
 but I absolutely have to go to the loon now. It's much harder in these video conferencing chats

39
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,200
 and it can be hard to just kind of slip off the edge of one of them without people kind of noticing.

40
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,120
 Especially if they then see from their VR environment, the engaged conversation with more

41
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,360
 interesting people across the room. Differently interesting. It's a good save. It's I suppose hard

42
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:43,760
 to hide at the other end of the bar when it's a 2D space with no hiding places. But I've done

43
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,240
 I've done kind of abrupt good boys from zoom calls and people don't seem to have been too

44
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,080
 offended. So I don't I don't know I think people are usually pretty chill about maybe I'm wrong

45
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,760
 but I feel like people are pretty chill about that kind of thing.

46
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:11,120
 Right on to letter of comment two. So this is from Mark Olson on the 25th of April 2020

47
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,520
 and he says that he stumbled across us and listened to our first podcast which he enjoyed.

48
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,440
 But he does say that he thinks we might want to mention the date because he did not read it

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,160
 sorry he did not listen to it close to the time of recording and so some of it didn't make a

50
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,520
 lot of sense and I if you remember episode one had we had not fully gone into lockdown yet so a lot

51
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:43,360
 of it was immediately rendered quite dated. Today is Wednesday the 17th of June 2020. It is

52
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,240
 and this show will probably be going out on the 24th of June I don't guess. Oh yes we're recording

53
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,760
 early that's kind of showing behind the curtain isn't it? It is it is indeed. But yeah he we were

54
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,080
 talking in episode one about the lack of a written constitution for Eastercon and he mentions the

55
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:14,160
 Lunarians which were New York fandom and I did not appreciate this but because of a series of very

56
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,640
 very rigidly defined rules in the club constitution the club was invalid because they had not sent

57
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,400
 notice of elections which meant the old officers terms had expired the new officers had been improperly

58
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,120
 elected because the notices had not been sent out and so there were no officers there was no

59
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,280
 secretary so there was no one who could send out a notice of any elections and so there could

60
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,640
 know it be there could never be any new officers and therefore the club stopped and this was a club

61
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,880
 with fewer than 20 people all of whom saw each other frequently so there is a sort of risk in having

62
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,680
 rigorously defined systems which is if you don't have the imagination to foresee the way in which

63
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,360
 the system could go wrong you can end up painting yourself into rather a corner. The problem was

64
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,120
 solved by forming a new club called Lunarians 2.0 and that failed because they couldn't agree about

65
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,960
 who they would let into the new club so it stopped. I have thought about this which will come later

66
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,440
 in the episode with regards to the Was for Spisses meeting this year but it is a cautionary tale

67
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,800
 and what I would encourage people to listen to. I particularly liked his phrase of the club was

68
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:37,120
 what did he say the club accumulated noxious deadwood and I wouldn't like to comment as to whether

69
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,960
 that applies to the World Souths Fiction Society. This just feels a bit like you know when I have

70
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,880
 an account on a website somewhere and then I forget my password and forget to update the email

71
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,520
 address and basically just have to make a new account all over again just keep making new clubs

72
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,400
 called Lunarians 2.0 3.0 3.1 4 whatever you like just go for it. Yes there's a good good way of

73
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,360
 dealing with I think. I think there's a spectrum of fandom and you can tell which end I am on.

74
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,440
 Yeah the East End. Well I mean I've always been on the spectrum of fandom that said we shouldn't

75
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,680
 really organise anything and I mean we can we can organise stuff in the sense of making things

76
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,280
 happen. It's just the point where you decide that it's easier to make things happen with a

77
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,240
 written constitution I'm always slightly skeptical of that because in my experience

78
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,960
 things of that kind tend to be used in order to prevent things from happening rather than

79
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,160
 making them happen. And anyone who is a co-host on the OctaThought podcast will know how true it is

80
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:45,200
 that Alison is opposed to formal organisation of things. That's harsh. It is harsh. I don't regret

81
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,480
 it but it is harsh. To be fair when John got in touch and said are you interested in doing a

82
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,600
 podcast I did warn him about this at that exact point. I knew I was getting into it's true. Mark

83
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,520
 also wrote to us to comment on later episodes. So he said that he thought our point about

84
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:14,880
 fandom doing virtual socialising from day one was quite perspective and commented on our

85
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:22,640
 talking about the first Thursday and then talked about Conzeland and he is I think quite

86
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:33,600
 skeptical of Conzeland because he isn't convinced that you can have a time zone which sufficiently

87
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,400
 sort of encompasses everyone who needs to be encompassed because you need to

88
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,200
 encompass kind of traditional world con fandom in the US but also you need to encompass

89
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,640
 New Zealand fandom obviously because it's a New Zealand con and so on. And he also says that he's

90
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,880
 skeptical of having programming for such thing because you need to have enough program that you

91
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,880
 can call it a world con but not so much programming. If you have a level of programming that won't

92
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,840
 tie people out it will feel like a much smaller con and he basically concludes by saying that he's

93
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:18,000
 not good sizing Conzeland's competence. He's just not sure that it's a workable proposition in any way.

94
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,520
 I think since he wrote that stuff like Baldtecon has happened which has shown that you can I think

95
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,040
 get around some of those problems quite well but it's an interesting take as to kind of at what point

96
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,720
 do you sort of change things enough to make it workable online to the point where it doesn't

97
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,880
 really feel as big as a world con should anymore. Yes I think a lot of the points Mark raises have

98
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,440
 possibly been addressed by other virtual conventions in the meantime. So if Mark is not to upset with

99
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,920
 us for failing to read his emails in a timely fashion and he has any updates we'd love to hear

100
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,720
 them. Yeah definitely. And I think I think I think you can cat hurt. I mean we can cat hurt

101
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,080
 panelists to showing up in the right rooms at the right time just about and in the case of the

102
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,280
 East of Con usually by bribing them with a free beer if they'd like that. So I'm sure you can you

103
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,080
 can get them to show up for the right zoom. You might just need a team of zoom Wranglers. Yes and

104
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,840
 send be a sort of two panelists through various delivery services.

105
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,760
 And I also think about the Hugo's I think part of the problem with the Hugo's is you do have this

106
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,040
 tension between providing the best experience for people in the room and also providing a good

107
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,640
 experience for people watching online at home and possibly if you're only trying to do one of those

108
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,000
 things at once it will simplify things immensely. That is fair. That's a good point. Alison do you

109
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,080
 have anything you'd like to say? I've promised to myself I'm going to be quieter this week.

110
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:59,520
 I mean firstly episode title so that's great. Secondly we like you talking. It's a key part of

111
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:07,440
 our shtick is that we talk. But actually I feel I've probably said all I've got to say

112
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:16,560
 about Conzeland until I see the draft program and their draft plans for social space at which

113
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:25,120
 point I expect to have enormous amounts to say. So I am I am holding my fire on that. But I did

114
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,800
 like his final thing saying that we seemed very reasonable and are we sure we're fans.

115
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:39,040
 Yes that did maybe chuckle. I liked that. We've definitely disproved that in subsequent episodes

116
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,640
 haven't we? Yep. Yep. Well we've we've we've proven our lack of reasonability both in terms of

117
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:54,480
 having had very wide sweeping wide sweeping wide ranging opinions on future episodes.

118
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,840
 But also by having not done a reasonable job of reading letters of comment. So we've neatly

119
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,280
 put ourselves straight back into the fan category. Also I will say I edited out all of the really

120
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,680
 acrimonious bits obviously. So it's very easy to be reasonable when you can edit out the arguments

121
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,720
 afterwards. Yes I was going to say I meant to say it's clearly we're clearly reasonable in the edit.

122
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,840
 Yes.

123
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,520
 [Music]

124
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:34,080
 Andrew Hogg sent us an email on the 19th of May and he um he was worried that we're mispronouncing

125
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:44,600
 Claire Breiley of Chor

126
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,880
 I am 99% certain we are pronouncing Claire Breiley's surname correctly because I have been

127
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,520
 harangued on that matter on many times on many occasions. When I gave Claire her Hugo Award I

128
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,480
 pronounced her surname incorrectly and so if I ever win my own Hugo Award my entire acceptance

129
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,800
 speech will just be to say her name correctly and then Moonwalk off the stage. Can you Moonwalk?

130
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,400
 No I'm going to have to learn to know. Okay so you better get practicing that hadn't you?

131
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,760
 I'm not going to win a Hugo Alison so I'm not sure it's going to come up.

132
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:25,800
 Are you a Hugo finalist? I am as mentioned by Mark Plummer in his layer of comment from the 23rd

133
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,560
 of May 2020 which is addressed dear Alison Liz and Hugo Award finalist the Boy Coxon.

134
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,960
 Doctor Hugo Award finalist the Boy Coxon. That's me. That's you.

135
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:46,760
 And so he says he's enjoying the Octa Thought podcast which is good. And he also asked whether

136
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:56,680
 or not we could give ourselves names as according to the style of the kids TV show Octa Norts in

137
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,800
 which they're a character called Vegemals which are half animal and half vegetable. Hence

138
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,760
 Tuneip is half tuna half tournip and carp preka is half carp and half paprika.

139
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,680
 So tell me about Octa Thought. Octa Norts. I know nothing of this.

140
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,840
 It's students program about basically a crew of underwater explorers who are all animals and

141
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,160
 they have like they have like a set of vehicles a bit like Thunderbirds.

142
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,400
 Nice. And then they go on adventures and I'm really watching that much detail but apparently

143
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,840
 it is like scientifically accurate about all its underwater adventures and they also for some reason

144
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,200
 have these things which are half animal half vegetable and all their names are like a

145
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:45,960
 you know mash up of the two names. So what's a good one? Alba Choy is half bok choy half albacore

146
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:55,160
 going to make me do anyway. It's good innit. Ten out ten I could be had hadtato half hadt

147
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,680
 hadtato half potato. That's pretty good. Yeah I was proud or hmm.

148
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,760
 Try to think what my favorite my favorite fish is definitely hadtock.

149
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:16,120
 But what's my favorite vegetable? Cógette. Hadet. Hadet. Um yeah so is that good?

150
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,640
 I think that's pretty good. Are we limited to vegetables only? How can we have fruit?

151
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,360
 No it's vegetables only isn't it? Mmm. But it does say animals it doesn't necessarily say

152
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,560
 it has to be fish. That's true but I mean just both of the examples of fish.

153
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:36,520
 I generally the theme of the show is fish related. I say I won't. I've only seen like

154
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:43,080
 snippets of octonauts when babysitting children who loved octonauts. That is fair I have never

155
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:51,240
 seen any octonauts but feel I should now go and look them up. Maybe we should have a special

156
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,480
 episode next week. About octonauts and I'm gonna be a crab to choke. Yes nailed it.

157
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,600
 Oh great name that is a flippy green name. Love it okay straight in the show.

158
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:12,040
 But Alison have you got a octonauts name? I have been thinking about this I may have to return to

159
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:19,560
 you next week but in the meantime I quite like a moose rot which is a combination of a moose and

160
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:27,080
 a carrot. I like it. But when I first thought that I said a combination of an animal and a

161
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:33,000
 vegetable and I was like oh you mean like salmon and sushi rice but I think I may have

162
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,200
 been missing the point there. Also neither of those is a vegetable. Sushi rice is definitely a vegetable.

163
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,520
 Is rice is a vegetable? Yeah it's not meat. I mean it's as much of a vegetable as paprika.

164
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,320
 Uh paprika's a pepper, chili pepper. Paprika paprika. One of those is a chili pepper.

165
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,480
 Plus we are getting that for Wikipedia I'm not sure if that is a fully canonical octonauts name.

166
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,000
 Andrew Hogg asked is there a piece of media you waited over a decade for and it actually lived up

167
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 to expectations? Um yeah which is such a good question that I think we should bring it back at

168
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,360
 a future episode. Not least because I've got a hook to tie it to one of the Hugon nominated

169
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:24,360
 thank-ars. Which talks about books that haven't come out yet which is not is kind of irritating

170
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:32,200
 but they were saying that Susanna Clark's Piranesi lives up to expectations. There was nothing like

171
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,560
 Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. And he also says he's looking forward to further updates on

172
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:45,480
 Lough the Liz Only fan fund. It's not clear to me whether this is only for visiting Liz whether

173
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:53,240
 this is only for Liz to visit or both but yeah gotta get that going. I think this is a follow-up

174
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,560
 to our previous discussion where I threatened to send you a map and point out where Australia

175
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:04,200
 was if you recall. It could well be. I'm basically my own you know uh fan fund zone for now.

176
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,800
 And Mark very kindly described octaphthorpe as similar to listening, sitting in the bar listening

177
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,280
 to the three of you having a conversation and being unable to get a word in edge ways.

178
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:23,640
 It's not untrue. To which he said Alison Willard so exactly like that then.

179
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:32,200
 And also I will say that Claire has mentioned a similar sentiment to me but she says she always

180
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,480
 wins the arguments she has with us because we can't answer back to her witty repartee.

181
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,720
 So this is actually a feature rather than a bug I feel. If you if you want to have the last word

182
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,160
 just mutter under your breath as you listen and it will go well. I thought that was a huge

183
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,280
 benefit of podcast generally. I mean I'm forever shouting at podcast. And now you shout during them

184
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:01,400
 as do we all. Another man called Joseph Norton sent me an email to the podcast email address

185
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:09,320
 thanking me for putting mp3s of the vinyl albums of the hitchhiker's guide to the

186
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,960
 galaxy on my website which I did ages and ages ago because I have the vinyl albums and they're

187
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:23,240
 different to the original radio series. So I recorded them from my dad's turntable using some

188
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,760
 audio recording software on a laptop and then because no one else had put them online I thought

189
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,240
 well you know that one's gonna lose out. Since then there has been a vinyl release of hitchhikers but

190
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,120
 I think it is a vinyl release of the BBC show. I don't think it's a vinyl release of the original

191
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:50,040
 vinyl albums but yes so he said thank you and you're welcome Joseph. Claire you're enjoying them.

192
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,560
 And thanks for listening to the podcast it's nice that we have listeners who aren't actually

193
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,880
 already our personal friends. It's not it's actually not 100% clear to me whether he listens to a

194
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,000
 podcast or whether he found the podcast by googling my name. Either one that's an outcome. That is

195
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,160
 an outcome. Because I mean there is so I mean that he might have found your professional work he

196
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:15,960
 might have found your Hugo finalist thing. You know yeah you're you have a wide internet footprint.

197
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,480
 Then we have Claire's Claire Breyerley. Get me I'm gonna pronounce it now. And her that's your

198
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,400
 comment. Does Eddie do either of you want to go through that? You mean would you like me to do

199
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,840
 some some rising because you've done quite a lot of summarizing on this podcast already.

200
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:45,000
 I'm worried the listeners will be very bored of my voice. Yes so Claire centers a letter

201
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,960
 having caught up with episodes six and seven wishing all the best to John's microphone which

202
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,920
 is no longer unwell and revealing she has drunk a beer called Edgelord. She does not reveal

203
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:01,960
 whether she knew the meaning of the name of the beer at that time. She's also asked if

204
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:10,040
 so shirts make a grumpy old fart cap for a for world con exhibition heads. Anything can be things

205
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:18,680
 can be arranged. They do now. Anything can be arranged with so shirts. So Claire is really much. We we

206
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:24,200
 discussed briefly I think this is how you lose the time war which I think I had read and you guys had

207
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:31,640
 not read correct. Not yet. Still haven't still not read it. It is on my iPad waiting. It's very nice

208
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,000
 because I I enjoyed it and thought it was good but it did not speak to my heart. Claire has written

209
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,120
 in because it did speak to her heart about the love story and about finding people and how truly

210
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,200
 distinct that is from sex and or friendship and also recommended the books by Nick Bantock called

211
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,880
 Griffin and Sabine which I have never read but I might look into because they're apparently a

212
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,480
 reminder of this is how you lose a time war. Yeah I'm I'm looking forward to reading it because I

213
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:10,280
 have obviously heard an awful lot about it at this point. I'm currently reading the Becky Chambers one

214
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:17,080
 which I do not remember the name of. I think it's to be taught if fortunate. To be taught if

215
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,160
 fortunate and the reason I'm currently reading that is that because in the Hugo

216
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:28,360
 Photo Packet it only came as a PDF and I currently have a ebook version on loan from the library

217
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,960
 so I can read in a slightly nicer format but I have to read it first but after that I shall

218
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,640
 probably do the rest of the novellas so I will hopefully have listened to it by next time.

219
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,720
 I'm sure nobody with any influence in these matters ever reads this but I have taken the view that

220
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:53,560
 if your submission to the Hugo Photo Packet only comes in PDF format then I will deprioritise it

221
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,120
 in my Hugo reading and seeing as I never managed to get all the Hugo reading done anyway

222
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,880
 this means that you are less likely to get my vote. I am sure I'm not the only person but I thought

223
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,680
 I wanted to say this publicly so that the people out there who make the decision to put these things

224
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:15,560
 in as PDFs know that it's not actually as efficient as putting things in as ePubs or any other

225
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:23,160
 ebook format and if you're doing it because you're worried that people will par at the e-book then

226
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,720
 you're being a bit silly because obviously the PDF is sufficient for people to be able to do that

227
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:34,280
 anyway. I know that this has no effect but I just kind of want to shout into the void occasionally.

228
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:42,200
 Yeah that's fair. Now I will say I do agree with you in that if a book is only available in a format

229
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:50,040
 that I find stressful to read or if a book is not available in full then I will try and read it

230
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,240
 I'll try and borrow from the library but if the book doesn't come through by the time the deadline

231
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,240
 happens then yeah that that will mean I don't vote for it. Last year that was The Calculating

232
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:10,120
 Stars by Mary Robinette Coel but then that won so I'm not sure that my failure to read it in time

233
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:17,720
 really affected it meaningfully at all. It was a fantastic book. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Think it

234
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,720
 deserved to win. Did not read it until after the ceremony because that was when my library hold

235
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,520
 came through. I know it's never up to it's really never up to the authors is it. It's decisions made

236
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,960
 at a publisher level so I don't know to what extent to what extent back be helped.

237
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:43,560
 I agree with Alison entirely on the PDF thing but I also read 100 pages The Calculating Stars

238
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:50,600
 and decided nope and put it down to read something else so I've had that. I've had that.

239
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,720
 Not every book has to be for everyone. No and I felt quite pleased myself for reading it and going

240
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,560
 no this is not my thing. I'm putting it down and reading another book and I was on a reading

241
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,480
 holiday at the time so there were probably several hundred other books around for me to choose from.

242
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:17,960
 Did anyone write to us suggesting things that we could read or do to improve our

243
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:27,160
 awareness of Black Lives Matter and related issues John? No. Have either of you done anything to

244
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:35,560
 enhance your awareness of your white privilege? Yes I have read Superior by Angela Saini and

245
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:44,120
 that was very good. I think that it helped me see kind of some of the issues around ethnicity as a

246
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:51,400
 kind of categorization system and I read it while on strike as part of the Black in the Ivory

247
00:26:51,400 --> 00:27:00,760
 slash Black Lives is STEM strikes which happened a week or two ago now. I've also bought How to Be

248
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:08,920
 Anti-racist by Ibram X Kendi and also looking forward to reading that but I have not yet read it.

249
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:17,080
 I've also started monthly donations to a couple of other organizations that were on the Google

250
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,480
 sheet of organizations that we had in last week's show notes so that's what I did since last time.

251
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,480
 Why do you do anything? I put a load of books on my hold list for my local library

252
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,120
 which are all extremely popular and will no doubt come through in about November but I mean they

253
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,440
 will come through and I will then read them. I listened to some podcasts by Black creators.

254
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,360
 The one I enjoyed most was it's called Nerds of Prey and hasn't actually had a new episode out

255
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:53,400
 since December so I'm not entirely sure I want to mention it specifically. I like some other ones

256
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,360
 but they're more in my kind of normal tech and scientific niches rather than science fiction and

257
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,400
 fantasy ones. I'm still looking for some recommendations there and I also donated some money to some

258
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:12,440
 charities that work with disadvantaged people and with legal defense for people in the UK.

259
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:20,760
 So my recommendation would be there is a list posted by so Sirens Conference which runs every

260
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,960
 year in the US. I've posted a list of 50 works by Black authors which I am basically working my

261
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,960
 way through. I've read some of them some of them going on my wish list a couple of which I actually

262
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,720
 owned and will be now coming to the top of my reading list. I am like making an effort to read

263
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,640
 more books by Black authors and buy more books by Black authors especially over the next couple

264
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,200
 of weeks as I think there was a drive to try and buy them in a particular week and just bring them

265
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,120
 to the top of the bestseller lists. So I read The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead which is not

266
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:03,880
 science fictional but is another spectacular novel from him. Quite a harrowing read about

267
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:14,600
 two young Black men in a juvenile facility in the US in the 1960s which is great. Like John I'm also

268
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:22,200
 an academic so I'm reading a lot of the Black in the Ivory stories about the experiences of Black

269
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,080
 academics and trying to think of ways that we can help in this area and I have also donated to

270
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,280
 some organisations from the list we put in the show notes last week.

271
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:44,040
 Claire also sent me, she sent I think many people a short fanzine about Weetabix.

272
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:50,040
 She didn't just send a short fanzine about Weetabix, she sent Weetabix. Have you not had your Weetabix yet?

273
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:57,880
 I have had My Weetabix but I don't want to talk what? I have also had My Weetabix.

274
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,720
 Oh she sent you Weetabix as well. There was a picture of an entire carrier bag full of Weetabix.

275
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,280
 I don't know to whom Weetabix was sent but I think it was a large operation.

276
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,360
 I think I may have failed because obviously I got a Weetabix because I had sent Weetabix.

277
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,360
 My Weetabix arrived completely unharmed but it did not go large letter. I think the question of how

278
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,600
 you get Weetabix through at large letter rate without arming it is still an open one.

279
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,920
 That presumably means that you'll have Weetabix impounded by Thai customs at some point Liz.

280
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,520
 I don't believe Claire has sent me Weetabix if only because she's not at any point

281
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,560
 asked for my post address in order to send me Weetabix. So unless she somehow intuited my address

282
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,520
 or she decided to just put Weetabix care of Liz Bathy Thailand hopefully they have not impounded

283
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,480
 a Weetabix. Has anyone tried just sending a Weetabix to Claire Brierley, Fishliffer Towers,

284
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:07,480
 Croydon and seeing if it arrived? It might arrive. The Royal Mail can really surprise you and Claire

285
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:15,560
 Brierley I assume is not a terrifically common name. Right so if you work for the Royal Mail and you

286
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,920
 find a package in 50 years when you listen back to this historical record that looks to be some

287
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:28,920
 fossilised Weetabix now you know where it came from. Fossilised Weetabix looks exactly like Weetabix.

288
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:38,680
 Well I will say and I also will say that I did in response to her fanzine about Weetabix

289
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,480
 implore her to write three more fanzines about Weetabix so I could nominate them for Best Fanzine

290
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,120
 at the Hugo Awards which I think would be brilliant. I'm not super hopeful it would win but I'd

291
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:57,000
 definitely nominate it. I think we should be going for a new category Best Fanzine about Weetabix.

292
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,040
 Start the process.

293
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:11,960
 On the subject of Wussfuss procedures. Have we now finished follow up John?

294
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,680
 We have finished follow up Alison. Some of you may be aware that Cone Zealand is being held

295
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:24,200
 online this year but this is not stopping the World Science Fiction Society holding a physical

296
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:32,280
 business meeting in Wellington because according to File 770 and I quote "it cannot be moved online".

297
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,520
 What do I think about that peeps? The Octa Thorpe rant.

298
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:47,000
 See we've got a new show segment name. Why can it not be moved online? Like I have not delved into

299
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,280
 the Wussfuss constitution for a little while so I can't remember like what the exact wording is

300
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,440
 is it that we literally can't move online because something says you cannot do it online or we can't

301
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,280
 move online because there's not a way of doing all the things the business meeting needs to do

302
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:07,560
 online or it's some other reason. It's possible that we cannot do it online because Wussfuss has a

303
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:16,040
 brush up its collective arse. So here we're in a world where the UK Parliament, the mother of

304
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:23,080
 Parliament's run by Erskine May since the beginning of time manages to move itself online in a couple

305
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:29,400
 of weeks just by basically going "Huh does it make sense to not do this? No it does not let's go

306
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:37,240
 online" whereas Wussfuss run by as we know Robert's Rules of Order goes "Oh no we have to have a

307
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:43,880
 physical meeting in the location specified" because I mean if Wellington was bombed what would they

308
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:51,000
 have done? You know I mean you can see them going "Oh it's ground zero but we have to be there

309
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,440
 because the Wussfuss constitution requires us to be there to hold our physical business meeting and

310
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,800
 there is no other way to do it and the Worldcon will come down around our ears if we do not hold

311
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,520
 a physical meeting now. There is another argument that says actually you know we could have brought

312
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:14,600
 it online but in fact having a micrometing on site is the sensible way forward because otherwise

313
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:21,720
 every rules lawyer in Wussfuss would just I'm trying to think of a metaphor here that's not

314
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,760
 extremely sexist and a bit dodgy over this prospect of arguing about this for three solid years.

315
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,760
 Right anyway that's all I had to say on the subject. How does that relate to you? How does that

316
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:43,160
 compare to your rad? I don't know it depends how passionate I am about the rant. As far as I can

317
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:51,640
 tell and I am interpreting a constitution and I am not a lawyer and to be honest you'd need to be

318
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:58,280
 a lawyer to appreciate all of the nuances and subtleties of the Wussfuss constitution but as far

319
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:08,040
 as I can tell the problem is Article 5, Section 5.1, Subsection 5 which states that the quorum for

320
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:16,360
 the business meeting shall be 12 members of the society physically present. Now I have double

321
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,840
 checked and as far as I can tell the word physically is not actually defined anywhere in the constitution

322
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:31,320
 so I assume that they're relying on a definition according to the dictionary and my dictionary

323
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,000
 defines physically as in a way that relates to the real world and things perceived through the

324
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:44,680
 senses as opposed to the mind. So I would argue that if you wanted to and you had the mental

325
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,880
 gymnastics present you could interpret that to allow an online meeting as long as everyone was at

326
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,920
 the online meeting and you could see them with your senses but perhaps there would be a point of

327
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,280
 order raised and people would get very frowny. It does also say in the constitution that any

328
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,240
 member of the world cons should be allowed to attend the meeting so I'm also sort of tempted to

329
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,680
 arrange some sort of splinter group where we all threaten to attend the meeting in strict

330
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,400
 contravention of international law unless they don't hold it and I wonder what they would do then.

331
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,280
 But yeah it's disillusioned Chris and it comes down to the point made earlier in the episode

332
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,600
 about if you have a set of rules that is sufficiently rigorous that it does not permit for certain

333
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:35,400
 things that may go wrong to go wrong then those rules can end up with silly situations like

334
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:42,120
 having a situation where 12 people have to meet in Wellington to have the business meeting and I

335
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,440
 would argue that if it does have to be held at the Worldcon and the Worldcon is in cyberspace

336
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,040
 a physical business meeting in Wellington is in contravention of the Wussfers constitution

337
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,880
 and should be immediately disallowed. I'm genuinely like this constitution does not provide for the

338
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,200
 circumstance so you've got to do some imaginative reading of the rules but given that you have to

339
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,240
 do some imaginative reading of the rules well earth not imaginatively read the rules to allow a

340
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,440
 virtual business meeting that we can actually attend and participate in. This is the end of my rant.

341
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:19,240
 Because they don't wanna because they think it would be too hard. I feel that the Eastcon managed

342
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:28,840
 to make this happen perfectly adequately and that it doesn't seem I mean obviously we did it without

343
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:36,200
 the benefit of a constitution or rules of engagement we just did sensible stuff in in a way that that

344
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:44,200
 was kind of quite English of us. I don't feel that they've necessarily taken the best option

345
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,640
 and there's clearly nothing to stop them having a meeting in which people join physically but the

346
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:57,080
 meeting is also online and people can make comments and suggestions online using some form of Q&A.

347
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:02,920
 I feel that with rules lowering like that John you have a great future heavy at the Wussfers

348
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:13,720
 business meeting. You take that back Batty! How do you feel about mornings? I mean I am I don't like

349
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,520
 that the business meeting is held at the Worldcon because he's a cargo to panels or the bar and

350
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:26,600
 to my mind the exciting things about Worldcon are panels in the bar so. So I guess I have less

351
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:33,720
 ranty opinions which are mostly just because I'm I think less bothered. I'm okay with them

352
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:41,800
 deciding this year okay we can't do a virtual one and it says we should have an actual physical

353
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,360
 gathering of 12 people so let's have a physical gathering of 12 people do the absolute minimum

354
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,040
 and punt this to next year but I do think next year needs to be thinking about this now and working

355
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:58,280
 out how they will do a virtual business meeting if necessary or if not how they can put in place

356
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,600
 all the structures in 2021 to enable us to do this in the future because we don't know when

357
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:09,400
 this might happen again but 2021 is a good bet for being online or for when it might happen again.

358
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,400
 I mean I think the most likely outcome for the Worldcon next year is not that it doesn't happen

359
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,120
 physically it's that most of its foreign visitors are effectively disenfranchised along with a lot

360
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,600
 of the older and sicker members of the Worldcon community which is quite a lot of people

361
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:32,120
 and Worldcon has a tendency to be the convention for a bunch of people in the northeastern United

362
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:40,920
 States anyway and having the business meeting only open to those people would be a major problem

363
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,320
 that I think they need to address. Is that fair? That's not too ranting? Was that ranting? That was

364
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:50,360
 quite ranting? That ranting and it is completely fair it's not going to land well with Wispus

365
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,440
 fandom who regard any attempts to change or modernise anything as if you are literally the devil.

366
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:05,640
 The comments or the Falsheventivity article declaring this are proof of that. I think in general

367
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,520
 if the Wispus constitution doesn't allow for this sort of things in these changing and if the

368
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,880
 Wispus constitution cannot be changed or if the Wispus business meeting cannot be held virtually

369
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,240
 we need to have a serious think about whether that means those two things are fit for purpose

370
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,800
 because I would argue it means they are not and we need to seriously rethink them. The fact that

371
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,160
 Worldcons were held completely successfully up until 1980 without any formal constitution

372
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,720
 rather makes me think we don't need it but perhaps we do and perhaps it's very important

373
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:40,200
 but in that case we need to fix the problems with it. I think any political system that responds to

374
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:49,160
 a crisis that requires immediate and well thought through but nevertheless speedy action with a

375
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,320
 decision to delay absolutely everything for a year is not demonstrating that it's not fit for

376
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:02,120
 purpose. It's demonstrating that it does not work at the thing it's supposed to do unless the

377
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:11,000
 thing it's supposed to do is retard change and obviously there are people in the in Wispus fandom

378
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,880
 for whom retarding change is a feature not a bug and I don't know I feel like there's something

379
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,200
 every episode that causes me to go and you call yourself science fiction fans though they might say

380
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,760
 but that's why we want to be careful of change because you know it we've read those books and it

381
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:36,920
 never comes out well. Our email address is octathoughtcast@gmail.com and we will read it we promise. I know

382
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,960
 history is not good of this but we will.

383
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:50,520
 Thank you everyone for listening to the eighth episode of the OctaThore podcast which will come

384
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:57,720
 out on the 24th of June 2020 and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from

385
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:04,120
 me. Yeah hey podcast have a fantastic weekend Liz. Started strong but almost immediately devolved

386
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:12,120
 into passive aggression with a title of your podcast. Yes I'm not sure that was one of our more

387
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:19,400
 coherent podcasts. The theme music for this episode was fanfare for space by kevin mccloud@ancompetech.com

388
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:26,360
 used under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license.

389
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:36,440
 Where are you putting these at the bottom? Oh I see. Good for you sir. And it was nice that it's a

390
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,120
 comment and they think we've been ignoring them. Is this like for weeks and weeks and weeks?

391
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:46,760
 Well I think Andy Janery knows we're not ignoring him but we do apparently have one from Mark Olson.

392
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,800
 Do from Mark Olson. Oh my god. Oops. I am John. I am bad at emails.

393
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:00,200
 Highlives. We're also hello we're also about at twitter. Oh I like the letter from Hulk. It's

394
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:08,600
 very nice isn't it? It is. Oh now I can't hear you at all. Maybe this can be a... oh no. Maybe

395
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,960
 this can be an all letter of comment episode. I was actually thinking that because I don't think

396
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,000
 we've got a lot of... I don't know if we've got a lot of topics. I've got the big business being

397
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,360
 but like I don't want to go on a ballad too much because it's a bit niche. And also at some point

398
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:30,360
 like just complaining about things gets wearing because that's what ATP does. What my favourite

399
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:38,200
 podcast in the whole world? I... yeah and I respect that. I was very confused. I'm like ATP. Do you

400
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,440
 mean a dentacy in Trisphos 8? Probably not. All tomorrow's parties. No also not. That podcast

401
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:51,720
 that you know isn't like all right fun. Or the um or the like tennis pro circuit. The problem with

402
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:57,080
 ATP is that because it... the thing that typifies the problem with ATP is because they could play

403
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,760
 it all the time. It means that when they're complaining about things that actually need people to

404
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,040
 pay attention. People ignore them because it's just ATP complaining again. And the thing that makes this

405
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,120
 the most obvious is when they were complaining about the MacBook Pro keyboards, no one paid

406
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,120
 attention. And then as soon as other people started complaining about the MacBook Pro keyboards,

407
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,280
 everyone was like oh this is a real problem. And the point where you complain so often that the

408
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,880
 things you complain about become non-remarkable is the point at which you complain too much. Like

409
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,760
 if you're just relentlessly negative about everything, it removes any value to your criticism. So I get

410
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,520
 a little bit frustrated. Relentlessly negative about everything. There's this week's title. So what are

411
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,680
 our topics for today then John? We're going to look at letters of comment Alison. I've put them in the

412
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:50,680
 show notes. And there are thousands of them. There are four? So we can start with a big old apology. Yes.

413
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:57,160
 Just a new one from Claire. And I don't think we owe a debt of thanks to Claire because if it had

414
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,400
 not been for her mentioning that we weren't getting our emails, we would not have known we would not

415
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,520
 get a Gary Vels. We would have believed we were podcasting into a void. Yes. Also Mark sent us an

416
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,000
 email about John just copy and paste them and we'll sort the like line spacing out later.

417
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:21,240
 As I can see you doing it. And also the vegetables are great. I do not know what that is, but I am

418
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,040
 curious. Well, you haven't watched up to notes, have you? No. You have not watched up to not.

419
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,640
 Is this the world show that far like? I believe I'm not sure it is Welsh, but you can get it in

420
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,760
 Welsh, which is so delightful. Apparently there's some transcripts. We have the other thing in our

421
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,800
 Gmail thing is a pile of things from otter.ai saying we've transcribed your podcast. Would you like

422
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,280
 to go and look at it? So at some point we will do that.

423
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,760
 Are you going anywhere nice this weekend, Liz? Yes, I'm just going to go and sit in a house with a

424
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:02,200
 pool and I am taking my inflatable pool hammock, my inflatable pool drinks holder, and my waterproof

425
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:08,360
 Kindle cover. And that's my weekend. So you're basically having a long weekend in a large bath.

426
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:15,080
 Yeah, pretty much. It does sound nice though. I feel like a holiday, a relaxing holiday

427
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:21,640
 somewhere warm would quite suit me about now. I think crucially, I haven't left Bangkok at this

428
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,160
 point for six months, which is probably the longest. Oh no, that's not true. I haven't left Bangkok

429
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,640
 for three months and I have spent most of that time kind of in my own neighbourhood with only

430
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:38,040
 occasional visits to any other bit of the city. I am feeling quite cooped up as I assume most of

431
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,800
 you are. So it feels like now is a good time to take the chance to go somewhere a whole three hours

432
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,280
 away because I don't know how long we will all have that chance to do that. So we've got to the

433
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:54,440
 point where having a weekend away seems like the most enormous luxury. Yeah, so we're all very,

434
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:01,640
 we're all very envious of you. I guess the question is, does our podcast feeling a lot like a

435
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:07,400
 conversation that we've had in the bar put off people who have not already had a conversation in

436
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:14,760
 a bar with us in the past? Right to octa-thorpcast@gmail.com, we promise we'll read it this time.

437
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,400
 That actually feels like the title of this episode, we'll promise we really will read it this time.

438
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,080
 So Marianne tells me that title of your sex tape comes directly from Brooklyn Dyerdine and had no

439
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:34,440
 antecedents before that and I was quite fascinated by that. That it comes more from that's what she

440
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:40,280
 said and then of course for people who are 10 years older than me, people 10 years older than me

441
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,840
 used to say as the actress said to the bishop, yeah, which is exactly the same thing as title of

442
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:53,480
 your sex tape. I think it is the same linguistic construction. I'm not sure that's a pur of anything,

443
00:47:53,480 --> 00:48:02,200
 but apparently it's Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a fine, fine show which has the problem that

444
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:08,680
 all shows about the police have. Of being a show about the police now, yeah.

445
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:15,080
 And about all television shows about the police have a structural problem with them.

446
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:22,840
 And Brooklyn Nine-Nine is often accepted, which is that they they almost invariably show either

447
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:29,400
 the police in general or the particular policeman who is the focus of the show as being

448
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,880
 a very upstanding member of society who does know or does very little wronging kind of

449
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:43,240
 pecadillo ways rather than other swiney I suppose. Well, I mean, I think we have maybe

450
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:50,200
 this is not entirely on the subject of our podcast, but there's been quite a lot of interesting

451
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,920
 writing about this, of how like most police things are procedurals and kind of to do a procedural

452
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:01,880
 kind of requires that the police end up being sort of the protagonist. And you know, you can

453
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,280
 wrap it up neatly because they catch the bad guys, but then you get things like the shield

454
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,080
 where the policeman is definitely not one of the good guys or you get something like the wire

455
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:17,480
 where the police are, you know, sometimes good and sometimes bad, but you know presented as this

456
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,720
 force which has all these different effects and ramifications on a neighbourhood. And I think

457
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:30,840
 there's some more examples. I am now going to pitch my lockdown show, which is a wussfuss procedural

458
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,840
 drama. They're by previous back on topic.
