1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
 *laughs* Sorry, I've been distracted by John eating a sausage sandwich. Is it a sausage

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,560
 sandwich? No, it's not. It's pesto and tomato. Oh, sorry, I've inadvertently kind of ordered

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,840
 you up. But I'm not sure I'm really going anywhere with this or have an interesting

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,440
 point to make.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:28,680
 *music*

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,920
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 63rd episode of Octa Thorpe, which is coming to you

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:44,000
 on the 4th of August 2022. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott. Oh no, I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,520
 And we have some letters of comments on episode 61. And first up, we have Christopher J. Garcia.

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,760
 He says that Alison is right about the no awarding of categories and that it should be

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,800
 ahead of the ceremony instead of during the ceremony. And he says that this is true of

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,720
 Olaf's proposal and we need to do a small apology because Paul Meimer wrote in to remind

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:19,960
 us that it isn't just Olaf Rockne's proposal, but it is also Amanda Wackerock's proposal

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,600
 and they co-authored it. So sorry to Amanda. And yes, that is both people involved. So

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,240
 thank you very much for writing in. Paul, we did correct it in the show notes, but we

15
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,320
 didn't correct it in the audio itself.

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,520
 Although that is, I mean, Chris's thing is slightly different. That is where no award

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,360
 actually beats out all the nominees in the puppy ears. And this is more, you know, where

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,280
 there is no award, not because no award was voted above everything else, but because

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,000
 the went in the votes. And I don't know if we should kind of take those two separately,

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,480
 but at the same time it might be, it might be nice if the people who are going to get

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,640
 no awarded knew they were going to get no awarded before they went and sat through the

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
 whole ceremony.

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,200
 And also it would have the advantage that if there was not going to be an award, you

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,600
 could just not award that award in the ceremony, which would potentially be quite good. But

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,080
 yeah, I don't know. It's an interesting point. And yes, you are right that they're slightly

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
 conflated.

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,480
 Maybe we'll see in six weeks time. Please vote in the hues.

28
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,120
 Yes, please vote for a fan cast and for all of the other fan categories. Doesn't have

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,160
 to be for us just for things that you like that have the word fan in them.

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,160
 Yeah, I just, it's true of the others other categories as well. You know, to talk, such

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,000
 a lower interest, you know, please vote.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,600
 Is please vote for best novel in case you had been planning not to novels deserve recognition

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
 to listeners.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,000
 So yeah, no, but I know we're going to say this every time, but do please do please vote.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,760
 This also writes to say that he has two rumors, one of which is a prototype he got from the

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,800
 museum because they had already got four rumors. So he took home, which is a flex about as

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,520
 big as the time. Chris told me that I was looking at the only computer which had been

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,440
 to the moon and also in his car.

39
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,320
 And that his second rumor, he gave to his children to take apart, which I don't think

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,560
 I could do because I've named mine a given it googly eyes. So I'm just going to have

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,920
 to give it if it ever breaks is getting like a Viking funeral, I think I'm now attached

42
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
 to it.

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,080
 I have a rumor called Colin.

44
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,200
 Oh, jot me to post you some googly eyes.

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,240
 What from Thailand? I'm sure there's a more local stock to me. It's

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
 Padland.

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
 Yeah.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,040
 Padlands like Thailand, right?

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,000
 In what sense? I don't know. So, and it's very good. It's good. It's named after the

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,640
 robot that for prefect re programs in mostly harmless because it is a bumbling robot that's

51
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,120
 very friendly and goes were and it hovers up the cat litter and that's good. So, hoorah,

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,760
 10 out 10 robot would robot again.

53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,560
 And then we also had an email from Roman Orzansky. He writes in on the subject of the

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,200
 wasfus constitution clause about minimum number of votes. And then he says that a more interesting

55
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,160
 question might be the language of first publication because at the moment, finalists need to have

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,560
 publication in English, say there is a South American world con and there was a big number

57
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,160
 of Spanish attendees say there's a novel published in Spanish, which has a very small English

58
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,640
 translation print run. It might gather sufficient votes to win not because of the standard of

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,120
 the English publication, but because of the standard of the Spanish one. He then asks,

60
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,520
 if the Hugo is a world award, why does it focus on first English publication?

61
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,400
 I mean, it, it, it doesn't though, does it? There is no requirement that no one a, no

62
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,960
 many for the Hugo's need to be in English. There's only an eligibility extension that

63
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,560
 they are eligible again when they are published in an English translation. So, there's no

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,240
 requirement that they actually be in English. It's just, it's never, it's just never come

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,600
 about. I mean, it may come about in 2023, if there are sufficient voters who vote for

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,160
 something in a Chinese language edition, I think that is one of the more plausible scenarios

67
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,080
 just because if they have loads of members and many of them are not reading English language

68
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,320
 science fiction. Thank you very much for that, Roman.

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,840
 So we had a comment on Facebook in which Bridget Bradshaw says that if someone told me they

70
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,680
 were pregnant, would I tell them they needed a P test? And that is a joke about statistics.

71
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,080
 So thank you very much, Bridget. Or pregnancy tests. One of those. It's a joke about statistics

72
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,440
 and lateral flow tests. So it definitely pills the two thirds of this podcast, possibly

73
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,320
 all of this podcast. How do you feel about P test, Alison? Honestly, if I'm pregnant,

74
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,400
 that's going to be the least of all worries.

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:47,160
 Right. FantasyCon has been cancelled, everyone. Don't go to FantasyCon. It's not happening.

76
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,720
 Oh, hang on, breaking news from a week ago. It's happening again. Yeah. Okay, we should

77
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,760
 talk about this. Thank you very much, FantasyCon, for canceling and then re-instating themselves

78
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,320
 in time for this episode so we can discuss the entire thing rather than discussing it

79
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,200
 in two halves because that's very useful. We'd like to thank them sincerely for their very

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 thoughtful timing. Yes. So it appears that FantasyCon, which

81
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:18,120
 was planned to be run in September 22 in London in, I think, the Radisson Conference

82
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,920
 Centre where Eastacom was also held. They announced that it had been cancelled due to

83
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,320
 lack of ticket sales. There's a message picked up from file 770, which says that they had

84
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,480
 sold 200 memberships when they needed 400 memberships, which would give them a large

85
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,840
 shortfall. And so they cancelled. And then afterwards, there was a survey which went

86
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,240
 round essentially saying if we didn't run FantasyCon as we were planning to, but ran,

87
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,720
 you know, a different style. So I'd have one day one or a two day one or a virtual event,

88
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,920
 would you, would you attend? And it seems like this got enough positive messages that

89
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,960
 actually they just reinstated FantasyCon as a slightly shorter two day event at the same

90
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,600
 hotel on the same weekend. So it's basically back. I just found this whole thing quite confusing.

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,520
 It's interesting to think about how the finances work. If you only sold 200 memberships and

92
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,720
 that gives you a big shortfall, but then you must be pretty confident that if you run

93
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,640
 a two day event, you will be able to sell enough memberships to make it viable as a two

94
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,480
 day event without using a load of money. And I don't know anything about FantasyCon's finances,

95
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,160
 but I wouldn't have thought running a two day event in a hotel was that much cheaper than

96
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,880
 running a three day event in a hotel, especially if you're trying to get people to book more

97
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
 hotel rooms.

98
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,560
 I have two things about this. The first thing is, yes, it doesn't, it's not a great look

99
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,040
 for a convention. I understand that the running of FantasyCon is franchised by the British

100
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,960
 Fantasy Society. So they basically say to a committee, please, please run this on a behalf

101
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,240
 and you can do what you like with the profits and so on. And so there is a certain amount

102
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,400
 of, this isn't quite the same group who were originally going to run it, running it. So

103
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,080
 that might explain part of this, but I suspect what actually happened is that they went to

104
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,760
 the hotel and said, "Oh, we don't have enough people, please cut us a better deal." And

105
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,920
 the hotel went, "No, shant." And so they went, "Okay, we'll counsel then." At which

106
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,520
 point the hotel said, "As hotels want to do, oh, wait." So my suspicion is that by announcing

107
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,040
 the cancellation, they have been able to get a better deal with the hotel, including also

108
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,160
 obviously cutting the amount of hotel space they'll use because it's only a two day event

109
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,640
 rather than a three day event. But that would be my guess is that they've cancelled, is

110
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,200
 that that is what happened.

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,560
 And so let me just say something entirely unsubstantiated and with no evidence, because you know.

112
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,280
 That's what I said.

113
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,040
 But I feel like I heard someone say that like in the aftermath of the cancellation, like

114
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,160
 there was a rumor going around that the hotel had basically been like, "We're not going

115
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,840
 to give you a better deal," and then they kind of like, "What were going away then?"

116
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,600
 The hotel were like, "Oh, we would probably give you a better deal." And so maybe I think

117
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,840
 that, Talies War, you just said.

118
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,080
 That was certainly true for Pascon quite a long time ago now.

119
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,120
 No, I heard it recently about FantasyCon. I can't remember where, I can't remember who,

120
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,440
 and it might not be true listeners.

121
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,400
 I had not heard this as a rumor. I had only made it up out of my head on the basis of

122
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,360
 previous experiences of that exact process happening.

123
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,320
 I mean, it makes a lot of sense, right? Like...

124
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,520
 But hotels, if somebody comes to you and says, "If you don't give us a better deal,

125
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,320
 we are going to have to cancel our event." Do not call their bluff.

126
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,880
 I mean, yeah, it does seem a bit strange. The whole thing seems a bit strange at the moment

127
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,080
 with venues, foreshadowing, for later in the podcast listeners.

128
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,720
 What could we possibly talk about to do with venues for conventions?

129
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,160
 Hmm.

130
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,360
 The convention was only six weeks away, eight weeks away at the time.

131
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,480
 So probably if they went to a town and said, "Well, we're going to cancel the hotel."

132
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,880
 We're then like, "Oh, well, actually we can't get anything else in here at that time."

133
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,640
 You know, it's out of school holidays, so there's not going to be as many people wanting

134
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
 to stay in a Heathrow hotel. Yeah, so they probably...

135
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,040
 They may have been inclined to say, "Actually, how about we give you a reduced price for

136
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,560
 a reduced amount of space or something similar?" But we don't know.

137
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,480
 It makes a lot of sense, I think. So who's going to FantasyCon?

138
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,640
 I might be at FantasyCon. I think it would be great if I wasn't FantasyCon.

139
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,120
 I confess I was not really planning to go, and the Covaville has not really affected that

140
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,920
 in any way. I do wonder, to what extent a convention cancelling and then reconstituting

141
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,560
 itself affects people's likelihood of going? I can't imagine it's helpful, but it might

142
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,440
 not be a very big negative effect. But I don't know. If you're planning to go to FantasyCon

143
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,080
 right in, if you were planning to and you're not now right in, if you weren't planning

144
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,400
 to and you are now right in, or if you just think things right in, tell us what you reckon.

145
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,640
 It might make a difference, because there might be people who are on the fence about it,

146
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,160
 but then if it's like, "Oh, well, actually, we're in difficulties if we don't get some

147
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,080
 more people, this event will run," they might decide, "Actually, yeah, okay, I'll go along

148
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,480
 even if it's just for a day." I mean, I'm not going because it's two weeks after WorldCon

149
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,400
 and thousands of miles away, so...

150
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,000
 Yeah, I mean, I do think you have a better excuse.

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,280
 I have a pretty good excuse, yeah.

152
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,960
 This is not unlikely that I will be there for various reasons, but partly, but I might

153
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,240
 quite well be commuting, which, too, he throw is a pain. I mean, people who think that London

154
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,000
 is quite small, it's quite a long journey from here to Heathrow, because it's on the

155
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,080
 exact diametric opposite side of London to me.

156
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,280
 So yeah, FantasyCon. Hopefully, it'll be great. Do we know, I think the "chandmiti" has changed,

157
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,120
 right? Do we know what's happened to the committee? Who's on it now? And who is not?

158
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,400
 Do we know? I do, in general, find it very difficult to know what's happening with FantasyCon,

159
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,120
 whatever I want to know. When I was looking up FantasyCon stuff for the podcast last year,

160
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,680
 it was almost impossible to find out concrete information, and it wasn't helped by the fact

161
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,200
 they had two different websites, and it was all very confusing. So I do sort of wish there

162
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,920
 a bit more on the board with that. As it happens, the FantasyCon website currently still says

163
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,280
 that FantasyCon isn't being run, and they should probably fix that, because it is.

164
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,720
 It's got a link to an alternative, but it does appear that people who are joined FantasyCon

165
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,360
 will get a refund and then have to join the new one.

166
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,640
 Yeah, but also if you go on FantasyCon.org, it says it's cancelled and there's news about

167
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,840
 what might happen here. And then when you click through to what might happen, it's like,

168
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,520
 "Oh, it's running!" And it's like, "But you might want to mention that on the website,

169
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,080
 click here for the rescheduled FantasyCon." It's very strange, I don't understand.

170
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,640
 I have something that's definitely for podcasts to say about this, which is that if I was

171
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,040
 running a convention and was worried that I didn't have enough members and needed to

172
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,440
 get a lot more members, then my first course of action would be to make sure that all of

173
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,920
 my comms messages were lined up and saying the same thing and made it very easy for people

174
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,400
 to find out about the convention and join. And my second course of action would be to

175
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,240
 do a load of social media posts about how marvelous the convention was going to be and

176
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,200
 how it might be a really good idea to come along because you would be missing something

177
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,760
 if you didn't. And as far as I can see, FantasyCon did not do either of those things.

178
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,600
 No, it's very strange. I don't quite understand why. But I'm sure it'll be a great convention

179
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,600
 and let us know if you're going listeners.

180
00:13:33,600 --> 00:14:00,960
 The Clarke Award shortlist has come out.

181
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:10,780
 The book is actually presented in Orkney and in English so that you can read it in English.

182
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:30,840
 The book is actually presented in English so that you can read it in English. So I'm going

183
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,840
 to read it as a parallel text. Oh, that's really cool.

184
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,200
 And I think that is a first for the Clarke Award and that's quite exciting. It's probably

185
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,080
 the first science fiction book to be published by a major publisher in the Orkney language

186
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,760
 and I do speak Scots reasonably well having lived in Scotland for four years and I'm quite

187
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,960
 looking forward to this. Nice.

188
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,360
 I had not appreciated that. That is good knowledge. Thank you very much, Alison.

189
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,600
 Yeah, I have seen, I haven't got Deep Wheel OK, but I have seen pictures of it and yeah,

190
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,440
 I think it is presented in both languages which is quite interesting and I look forward

191
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,960
 to seeing how that works on my Kindle.

192
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,360
 Oh, that's a good question, isn't it? Oh, oh, hang on. Is this one of the ones I bought?

193
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,920
 Yeah, I think I think this is one that I've got.

194
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,840
 It is. I have got it. How does it work? Oh, it's just the Orkney and then the English.

195
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,200
 They're like, passagen or kney passagen English. Lots of little nice pictures separating them.

196
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,240
 Clentice? Also, I will say, I assume this isn't a problem with my e-book, which is always

197
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,280
 an interesting sentence, right? Like, is this how it's supposed to be or is it a mistake?

198
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,480
 Because I have been wrong about that in books before I've been like, oh, this is very artistic

199
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,960
 and there's like, no, you had a misprinted copy of what you do. But it does like, it

200
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,280
 has the word skilled wise magical cautious or one word and it has the word jut thrust

201
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,880
 and the word tap, chapped takes. And I assume these are, these are in the English segments,

202
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,280
 right? I assume these are artistic choices and not just like the e-book has the spaces

203
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,480
 in the wrong places. I don't know. If anyone's got the physical copy, please let me know.

204
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,560
 Yeah, that is correct. There is a review of this book in the Scotsman that says, "Canny

205
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,960
 is translated as skilled wise magical cautious and I would translate canny as canny, but

206
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,520
 then apparently I use big words." Yeah, like skilled wise magical cautious.

207
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,280
 I would translate canny as canny. I didn't know that was particularly Scots because it's

208
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,240
 all over Newcastle. So, yeah. Yeah, you're pretty close to Scotland, aren't you? Yeah,

209
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,720
 but we're not in it. Got a big wall to keep them out, you know. Very important. And how

210
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,280
 well is that wall working out for you? So I've bought Deep Wheel or Acadia, Skyward

211
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,480
 Inn and Wurgen, the alien love war. I've already read to them our team and the other

212
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,920
 two which are a difficult time and Clara and the Sun are, I believe, available from my

213
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,920
 library. So I will get them out from there. So that might be a spoiler for a future filler

214
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:05,920
 episode of Oxford. We'll have to see how many, how much people like our previous filler episode

215
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:13,360
 first because we, on which we have had no feedback. Yeah, no locks. No locks whatsoever.

216
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,840
 It has been a solid 12 hours since I dropped that episode. So it looks like a good, looks

217
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,160
 like a good roster, I think. Always exciting when it's mostly books I have no idea about

218
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,160
 because, you know, more books. And also books I had heard vanishingly little buzz about.

219
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,800
 Like most of the you goes, I was like, peripherally aware of, but the clerks are like, yeah, I

220
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,480
 had not really, it's just fine. I'm not plugged in enough, maybe.

221
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,920
 Well, I think that's the nice thing about the clerk is that it usually picks some books

222
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,040
 I've heard of and then some completely left wheel choices and some of them are absolute

223
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,520
 genius and some of them are absolute nonsense. So I always look forward to, but I'd always

224
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,200
 look forward to reading the shortlist in order to see which way they've gone, they've gone

225
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,360
 this year. I think there are two reasons for that. And one of them is, is excellent and

226
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,600
 delicious. Well, they're both good, really. The first is that the clerk judges actually

227
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:09,320
 read all the books. So if a book is very good, but it has almost zero marketing budget, then

228
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,720
 they will notice it and say this is amazing despite the fact that it had zero press. But

229
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,160
 it also means that sometimes you get a book that somebody on the judges absolutely adores,

230
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,920
 even though everyone else thinks it's a complete nonsense and it gets on because one person

231
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,320
 is prepared to fight for it hard enough to the point where everyone else goes, oh, good,

232
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,480
 we just want to get out and get to the barn.

233
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,200
 So I read, I mentioned last episode that I read the first Becky Chambers novel on a

234
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,280
 beach on my honeymoon. And the reason I did that was because we had to board a stage prior

235
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,040
 to the honeymoon to get beach reading. And there was a table of clerk award nominees.

236
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,080
 It was one of the books that was nominated for the clerk that year. So that's how I came across.

237
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,040
 Mainly because it had been nominated for the clerk and had a good title. I mean,

238
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,960
 I suspect me and Liz slightly differ in which side of the nonsense, not a nonsense divide.

239
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
 Do we think that book falls on?

240
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,880
 Well, that's, and this is a reason why we might want to discuss the clerks because

241
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,840
 my perception is that Liz and I have mostly very different tastes in Sartre's fiction novels.

242
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,920
 There is a very real risk that we read them all and go,

243
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,960
 yep, let's go feel Katie Martin again, please.

244
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,840
 We can just copy and paste the bit from episode 62 where we discuss the Martin to drop it in

245
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,280
 to whatever episode we do for the clerk and we don't have to talk about it again, right?

246
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,320
 No one will notice.

247
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,280
 Speaking about back shadowing, David Grigg, who does the two chairman podcast,

248
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,560
 also does a newsletter called Through the Biblioscope. And he discussed the books,

249
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,840
 the finalists for Hugo's this week. And for the Martin, he said, oh, this is the one I haven't read

250
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,920
 because I hadn't read the previous one and I didn't have time to read both of them and didn't fancy

251
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,520
 it. And then he goes on to talk about the other novels in a way that makes me think that he's

252
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,880
 likely to like the Martin a whole lot and I have commented to him to say so because otherwise his

253
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,400
 ranking was not as similar to ours.

254
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:05,400
 And then we've been foreshadowing it. We've been building up to it. You've known about it for a

255
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,120
 full two weeks, but let's discuss the very exciting news about the conversation venue.

256
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,440
 Take it away, Alison.

257
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,320
 Yes. So in the patch of time today that I might have been preparing for the podcast,

258
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,600
 I was busy announcing conversation, which is next year's Eastercon, which I am on the committee of

259
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,520
 as a site, which is the Hilton Birmingham Metropole. We will ask there for

260
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:38,200
 Ennominate in 2017. And we were previously there for Beccon 87. So that was a little while ago.

261
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,800
 It's much improved since then. And I believe it has somewhat improved since

262
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,560
 Ennominate. We've actually been there at least once or twice between that as well. It is a very

263
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:54,440
 large, very well appointed hotel, extremely close to a railway station and by a lake. And it is

264
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,400
 properly accessible and has all of the function space and all of the other facilities that we

265
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,480
 need and we are very excited to be using it. We'll be opening her hotel bookings quite shortly.

266
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,240
 I don't know whether that'll have happened or not by the time the episode comes out, so I don't

267
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:17,640
 want to say. But quite soon, if you haven't joined, we will also be increasing our membership rates

268
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,120
 quite soon. And again, I don't know whether that'll happen before or after this episode comes out.

269
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,400
 So but if it hasn't, then you just don't have long now, you should definitely get on and join

270
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,680
 the convention if you're planning to come because we're going to put the rates up.

271
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,240
 It was also the site of illustrious in 2011. Yeah, that's right. Illustrious was the other

272
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,680
 plate. Because I was like, I've been there twice. I know I have and I know I didn't go in 1987 for

273
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,600
 reasons. So there must have been one in between. For reasons we're not going to talk about. Yeah.

274
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,960
 But Caroline was on the committee of that one. So she's chairing this one and she was on the

275
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,960
 committee of that one. So it's kind of a return to a site that she's very familiar with. And although

276
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,320
 it's changed in some ways, there are some other ways in which it's just the same.

277
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:10,920
 In 2017, which was in nominate, they had Easter eggs in the foyer and conversation guest of honor,

278
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:17,640
 Neil Harrison won the bid at the fan fund auction to be able to pick his Easter egg and eat it.

279
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,720
 And he chose a very beautiful egg, which was actually a tree with lots and lots of eggs.

280
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,760
 And I have very fond memories of him basically having massive analysis paralysis as to which

281
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,440
 of these beautiful Easter eggs he should take for his winning bid. And it was very good. So I'm hoping,

282
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,480
 I mean, all I'm saying is drop lots of hints. Because it's good to auction Easter eggs at the

283
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,440
 foyer off the fan fund auctions. True fact. So I have fond Neil Harrison based memories of the hotel.

284
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,640
 I have quite a lot of fond memories of that hotel. I've often stayed at one of the multiple

285
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,400
 cheaper hotels offsite, sorry conventions. And I have quite fond memories of either like

286
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:01,080
 staggering back through the car park at 2am or in one case the hotel van driving us back to the

287
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:07,480
 hotel. Just very nice of them. I mean, I am going to say as I would do, like all Easter cons, we have

288
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,280
 a room block that we need to fill and we have a food and drink target for the beverage target

289
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:19,160
 that we need to achieve. But so we prefer people not to go book elsewhere. But you know,

290
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,040
 it's if you need to, there are plenty of other options in the area at lower rates, indeed,

291
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:30,760
 is this I don't think I think the only times I've ever not stayed in the con hotel are times when

292
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,240
 the con hotel was too small to stay in. It's like Bradford. I remember one of those I didn't and

293
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,800
 Harroga. I didn't. But the only other time is I think satellite for which is 2014 one. I stayed in

294
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,960
 the camp and I'll instead of the con hotel and I regret it every single minute of it. So, you know,

295
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:55,480
 I am a bougie boy and I require my breakfasts. Abooji. I quite often stay in the nearest premiere

296
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,160
 in which usually do pretty good breakfasts. Premiering breakfast is not bad. The World Con Hotel doesn't

297
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,080
 come with breakfast, by the way, John. I'm just mentioning that now before you get your hopes up.

298
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,680
 For Chai Kong? Yeah. Oh, no, I knew this. American hotels very often don't, but that's fine because I

299
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:16,520
 do love extremely cheap diners. Yeah, because American breakfasts are amazing. So, you know,

300
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,040
 getting a good breakfast near the hotels is not going to be difficult. I wouldn't have thought.

301
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,000
 Oh, you need Southeast Asian breakfast, by face. I do need that. I didn't know I needed it, but

302
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,480
 do need it. Can I get those in Chicago? Probably not, no. When Liz runs the Bangkok World Con,

303
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:39,720
 sorry, Globe Con. That's a deep cut for the listeners. I went to conference. Let's go in 1993.

304
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,920
 It's Paniya's first convention. And we stayed at the ANA. The ANA is the Japanese airline. It had,

305
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,960
 what I think is probably a Southeast Asian hotel breakfast buffet, and it was fantastic.

306
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,320
 Yeah, they basically try and cater to people who would like a sort of Western-style breakfast of,

307
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,400
 you know, pancakes and waffles and fruit. And also, usually, there's like an egg station that

308
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,360
 will make you whatever type of egg you like. Plus, there'll be like noodles and curry and egg fried

309
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,920
 rice for people who like a more savory breakfast. And on one memorable breakfast buffet, there was

310
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,280
 ice cream. Nice. I like breakfast. Egg stations are the dream. If you're at breakfast with an egg

311
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,640
 station, you know that's an excellent breakfast. Yeah, the plotter.com that was in Leicester had

312
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,920
 an egg station at the Holiday Inn in Leicester. That was very good. Nice. Oh, the Holiday Inn

313
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,880
 in Leicester. I know it well. That's very good. It had a very, very good breakfast. That was by far

314
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,680
 the best thing about the, well, probably about the whole convention actually, certainly about the

315
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,400
 hotel. My favourite breakfast in the country is located in Leicester in a small bar called Bados

316
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:47,320
 Hamanos. And they do a phenomenal full English breakfast and also a very good cadre. So that is

317
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,440
 very conflicting. So where are we thinking of holding punctuation, the in-person punctuation then?

318
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,080
 Whoever's got the best breakfast? Yeah, that's right. No, I mean, I'd be well if I holding that in

319
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,040
 Leicester. There are good hotels there. I like that city a lot anyway. And it's got the space centre.

320
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,800
 Leicester's a pretty good place to hold a convention. Not an East con, doesn't have sight,

321
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,600
 apart from the Hinkley. Let's not talk about the Hinkley. Hinkley isn't Leicester. It's quite close.

322
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:21,400
 Hinkley's a terrible town. Yeah, I mean, it's sort of in the same way that Crawley isn't London.

323
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,280
 Hinkley is not Leicester. I mean, I think it's in the same way that Croydon is actually London.

324
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,160
 Yeah, that's why I didn't say Croydon. Oh, he throw.

325
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:36,840
 Croyley is overflow Croydon and Hinkley is overflow Leicester. Croyley's quite nice, actually.

326
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,600
 Well, okay, they used to be a very good breakfast of holding Croyley. That's what I mean.

327
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,440
 Those are different things. There's a great beer festival in Peterborough. You'd never hear

328
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,480
 me arguing Peterborough was nice. I would say that the Hilton Birmingham Metropolitan has a solid

329
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,200
 breakfast. First-class breakfast. It does. It really does. And they never make you feel like

330
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,760
 because the 2011 Birmingham Convention was obviously between the second and third Ocons.

331
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,480
 And the contrast in the breakfast was very noticeable because they had like

332
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,520
 black and white pudding and they were friendly to you and smiled. And none of these things were

333
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:40,320
 true of the Ocon hotels. The Radisson non-

334
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,440
 waftra, I think did I do guys? You did one for a galactic journey. Oh, I was going to plug

335
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,040
 a galactic journey. Yeah, but in fact, I'll just do that as part of these things I've actually put

336
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,960
 in here, which is I wanted to do a quick plug for the Chicon Fringe, which is going on at the moment

337
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,320
 and is a series of discussions, some of which are local in Chicago. So if you're in Chicago,

338
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,840
 do go along to them. And some of which are online. And some of those are being run by Glasgow in

339
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:13,120
 2024, which is a bid for the 2024 WILCON. By the time this comes out, you will be too late to support

340
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,400
 Glasgow in 2024. So I probably should have plugged that last time. I'll go back and insert it into

341
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:26,880
 our episode before last. But meanwhile, there's a bunch of events going on under the Fringe banner.

342
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,280
 And I think they weren't quite a finished by the time we get this out. But I did one on Best

343
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,280
 Fanzine when I paid attention to and had a good look at all the Best Fanzine finalists and

344
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,160
 concluded that I quite liked all of them and had some nice things to say about them all of them.

345
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,960
 So thank you to everyone who came along to that. And everyone else reads the Best Fanzines. Go and

346
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,360
 look at what they've put in the Hugo Vert package, which is a great place to start. And what you'll

347
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,440
 find is that they are all very different, but also all very interesting and well worth your

348
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,520
 Hugo vote. This is linked to that previous plug to go and vote for fan things in the Hugo vote

349
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,480
 for the fanzines because they're jolly interesting. Also, as part of that, I had to declare an interest

350
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,560
 because I have now become a columnist on one of those finalists, which is Galactic Journey,

351
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,480
 which is a fanzine that is experiencing the world through the eyes of a traveler 55 years ago,

352
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:28,560
 exactly day by day. And so every couple of days it does an article in time about what's going on in

353
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:35,120
 science fiction and fantasy and fandom and culture in that time. And it's a very interesting high

354
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,160
 concept thing that I think everybody should be paying attention to. They also have a series of

355
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:46,160
 TV nights where they watch Star Trek, which I don't go to because it was not broadcast in the

356
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:55,120
 United Kingdom in 1967, but they also watched the first global TV broadcast together, and that was

357
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,240
 quite good fun. Wait, Alison, are you a purist? And so you're only writing about things that you

358
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,240
 personally could have experienced in the UK 55 years ago. So no Star Trek. I'm obviously

359
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,440
 blurring the edges around this for all sorts of reasons. I think one criticism of Galactic

360
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,080
 Journey is that it keeps in time, but it approaches things with the perspective of people in the

361
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,320
 2020s, though not the actual knowledge of individual events. Yeah. Yeah, I'm mostly just making a joke.

362
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,400
 There's an argument, I suppose, that if it wasn't doing that, you could just read

363
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,760
 fanzines from 1969, and that would be simpler. So I do think part of the interesting thing is the

364
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,640
 dramatic irony of it, almost right? Like the fact that you know what will happen and see you can

365
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
 play with our little bit is good. It's a really interesting project, generally speaking.

366
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:51,440
 They notice things that fans who were actually writing in 1967 don't notice, partly because you

367
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:59,440
 don't notice the sea when you're swimming in it, but partly because the fans in 1967 were

368
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,280
 mostly coming from one perspective, and there were a lot of other things going on in the world

369
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,640
 that were not necessarily from that perspective that are interesting, and were interesting at the

370
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,280
 time if you'd known about them, which she didn't.

371
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:25,360
 Shall we do picks? Why not? So my pick is a slightly unusual one, even for me having previously picked

372
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,280
 a rumba. Mine is a video called The Great Potato Wall. So you need a bit of backstory here, which is

373
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,560
 there was a Minecraft YouTuber by the name of Technoblade, who I had never come across until a

374
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,640
 couple of weeks ago when he died tragically early from lymphoma and the internet basically started

375
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,960
 posting a load of links in tribute to him. And so I started watching them. He'd been a Minecraft

376
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,280
 YouTuber for I think 10 years, you know, he started when he was only 13 or something and built this

377
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,520
 huge fan following. And The Great Potato Wall, I think, is the funniest one I've watched. It is

378
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:02,480
 the story of a man who in a Minecraft world attempts to become the number one potato farmer

379
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,040
 in the world. And I just recommend you watch it. It's 20 minutes, it's pretty funny. And there's two

380
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,320
 sequels to it where the man he beats to the spot of the one potato farmer does to get his revenge

381
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,080
 on him for trying to beat him to the pinnacle of potato collection. And can you make your Minecraft

382
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,560
 farm get you 1.5 million potatoes per day and so on. So yeah, it's pretty funny. It's something I

383
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:30,000
 would never have come across. Unfortunately, apart from people started posting the videos after his

384
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,560
 kind of tribute and a bit to restarting going around as well. And it makes me a bit sad that I never

385
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,400
 saw any of these videos when he was around to make some more. So I recommend, yeah, give it 20

386
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,560
 minutes over your time. I shall do that. My younger child, who is only a little bit older than,

387
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:51,760
 only a little bit younger than Technoblade, was extremely upset about his death, which was

388
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,000
 was an enormous shock to the community. And we had to have a non conversation about the way it is

389
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,040
 possible to be, to grieve for somebody that you've never met and only know over the internet from

390
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,240
 the things that they've done. Oh, absolutely. I mean, one of the podcasters who runs my,

391
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,680
 well, probably my favourite podcast, again, died tragically young, you know, literally the day after

392
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,160
 he'd made a podcast. And it was, it was just straight with this community who you've never met the

393
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,960
 person, but at this point, I'd listened to kind of hundreds of hours of his podcasting. So you felt

394
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,840
 like you have a connection to him in a way that you don't really, because he had friends and family,

395
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,560
 and you were people he'd never met. But you did all kind of come together and grieve for this

396
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,880
 person you had a very kind of parasocial relationship with. Yeah. And so this kind of reminds me of that

397
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,400
 in a completely different community. I haven't had that. The closest I've had is like when people

398
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,080
 like Terry Bradgio, I'm very little to have gone, and you feel like you know them even though you

399
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,640
 didn't. But yeah, it's tricky, right? Because you don't know them, but you're still very, very

400
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,800
 sad about it. And I say like Technoblade and his community have raised, they raised over half a

401
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,960
 million dollars falling from a research. So. Crikey. Yeah, they've done pretty well. That is,

402
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:11,040
 that's good going. Yeah. For a good cause. Mm hmm. My pick is in the vein of picking things

403
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,120
 that are up to date and relevant and down with the kids. I'm going to pick a 20 year old video game,

404
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:23,200
 a little number you may have heard of called Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic. Now,

405
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,440
 this is a relatively skewer game that hasn't had much of an impact on Star Wars fandom.

406
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:35,520
 So allow me to explain. This is a game by BioWare and it's a big old RPG and you can get it for

407
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,520
 almost every platform you could possibly imagine. It's like Doom. I believe it's been installed on

408
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,200
 a pregnancy test. Yeah. But I have it for iPad and I think I also have it for computer

409
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:55,200
 for on Steam. But basically I've discovered that I can connect my PlayStation 4 controller to my

410
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,080
 iPad and then I can play Kotor for long train journeys. And I recently had a trip to Coventry

411
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,440
 and a trip to Peterborough. And so I played a lot of nice the Old Republic. It's quite good.

412
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,160
 Listeners, I've discovered this and I'm telling you and this is the first you're hearing about it.

413
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,040
 I have a query. What's the query? Can you get it for the M1 Mac? Yeah. You get it for Apple

414
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,320
 Silicon Macs? Yeah, I think so. I think I could play on my computer. I don't particularly want to.

415
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,240
 Because most most Steam games don't play on Apple Silicon Macs in a very considerably

416
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,520
 annoyance thing even if they do one. If you wanted to play games, you probably shouldn't have bought

417
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,720
 an M1 Mac. I don't really like playing games on computers, if I'm honest. I like playing games

418
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,320
 mostly with controllers. But also I like playing games on platforms where you install the game

419
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,960
 and it works. And my experience of playing PC games when I was a kid is that the PC is not the

420
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,760
 platform you want. If that is what you are aiming at. I quite like my PlayStation 5 and I quite

421
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,600
 like my Nintendo Switch and I quite like my iPad and they let me play between them a lot of games.

422
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:07,680
 And you attach a controller to the iPad to play this sort of game? Yes. How? Which controller are

423
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:14,560
 you attaching? I'm attaching a PlayStation 4 DualShock 4 wireless controller. Which is red.

424
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,680
 Oh, and it just what it just syncs with your iPad? Apple have built in to their offering systems

425
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,200
 support for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox, whatever the current one is,

426
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,360
 and Nintendo Switch controllers. And they're all Bluetooth controllers. So you just connect them

427
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,800
 and they just recognize automatically. The really cool thing is that if you connect the Switch

428
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,120
 Joy-Cons, they're clever enough to know when you're using them in single Joy-Con or whether

429
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,720
 you're using them connected and the iPad can just like work out what you're doing and do it all

430
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,440
 magically like the Switch would. So it's quite a good implementation. But because I had a spare

431
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,560
 PS4 controller from when I sold my PS4 to Alison, I used that as my like controller for my iPad and

432
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,960
 my Mac. And I've been playing KOTOR with that. It is better than using the touch screen. I think

433
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,960
 the touch screen controls are all right. But like I think using a controller is better.

434
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:12,240
 But yeah, KOTOR is good. Yeah, but my eyes lit up at the idea of using Joy-Cons because Joy-Cons

435
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,560
 are tiny. So in terms of cutting them around, it's not like cutting a bloody controller around, is it?

436
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,760
 Yeah, I mean Joy-Cons do give me Handcramp, which is why I've bought a Switch Pro controller

437
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,880
 because there's really interesting article somewhere on the internet about how

438
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,560
 Nintendo designs for child hands and Sony designs for adult male hands.

439
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,960
 Our next box is on for giant hands.

440
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,960
 Hey, my hands are smaller than you think they are. And it's so true.

441
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,800
 So true. We lost week with little stubby hands. And I was like, Sue, I've got little

442
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,000
 stubby hands in this picture. And then I looked at my fingers and I was like, oh, it's probably

443
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,400
 all right, really. But I will say, I want to quickly say something about the law of the

444
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,400
 nice old Rorick. Oh, that's a fantastic game. The game is basically a D20 based role-playing game

445
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,960
 running in a video game, which is never something I really got behind. Because the great benefit

446
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,880
 of Paper RPGs is that you can let your imagination run wild. But I wouldn't argue that the simulation

447
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,480
 aspect is like as good as a video game, can simulate things necessarily. But what this does

448
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,400
 also mean is that when you become a Jedi, it's not really a spoiler to say you become a Jedi,

449
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,240
 because of course you become a Jedi. You have to choose one of three Jedi classes,

450
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,960
 and they're very rigorously defined, and you fall into one of them. And it's like,

451
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,600
 what's going on? This doesn't make any sense. And that bled through into a lot of the expanded

452
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,240
 universe media, because it was like there are these three types of Jedi. And that is how it works.

453
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,320
 And it's like, one of the great things about them having moved away from the expanded universe

454
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,160
 is that this model of how the force works has gone away. And that is probably better.

455
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,280
 See, I picked my class while rolling my eyes into the back of my head. But I have a lightsaber now.

456
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,720
 And I think it's yellow. Might be blit. I can't remember. It's A color.

457
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,640
 Kortles are pretty good game. Yeah, just very quickly. Star Wars Nice Thoroughly Republic is indeed

458
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:12,240
 optimized for M1 Max. The current Star Wars games that are are X-Wing, TIE Fighter, Nice Thoroughly,

459
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,480
 Nice Thoroughly Republic 2, and Rebel Assault 1 and 2. The others I have are not.

460
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,400
 But now I know I can play it straightforwardly on my iPad. That's what I'm going to do.

461
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,560
 Yeah, I still haven't bought an iPad. And now I'm like, oh, I could buy an iPad and play

462
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,320
 a night. So probably got it with my PlayStation controller. So it's even more likely we'll get an iPad.

463
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,320
 Yeah. So we are recording early listeners. You may not have noticed.

464
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,280
 So I am going to tell you about an exhibition that I'll go to in the future,

465
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,680
 because I'll go to it tomorrow. If we were recording at a normal time, I would have gone to it and I

466
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,760
 would have been able to have it as a pick. But I am going to it tomorrow. It is at the Hayward

467
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:57,040
 Gallery, which is the Gallery Bit of the South Bank Center in London. And it is called In the Black

468
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,080
 Fantastic and the Blurb For It Is, an exhibition of 11 contemporary artists from the African diaspora

469
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:09,920
 who draw on South's fiction myth and Afrofuturism to question our knowledge of the world. And it has

470
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,960
 had rave reviews with the England Standard saying there is unlikely to be a better show this year.

471
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,560
 The Observer saying a magnificent experience, spectacular from first to last. Several of my

472
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:27,440
 friends have seen it and raved about it. And then just lots of five star reviews. And I am going to

473
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,000
 it tomorrow with FARA and some other people. And I'm very much looking forward to it.

474
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,600
 But I haven't actually seen it yet, but I'm going to pick it anyway so that you can get on and get

475
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,920
 to it before it closes. It runs till the 18th of September and it's £13.50. And that's probably

476
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,000
 concessions. Because this episode doesn't come out for two weeks, obviously Alison will be taking

477
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,080
 a microphone with her and recording some live thoughts, which I will drop in now.

478
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:07,680
 It will be practice for our, you know, whatever guerrilla recording we decide to do at Ch icon

479
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,120
 and or when John is making lightsovers. Oh, cabaret, the gorilla's amazing.

480
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,360
 I would just say, I don't understand what that means. I want that wasn't what I was going to say,

481
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:23,920
 but you just said. Okay, so cabaret has a gorilla in it for people who don't know. And this particular

482
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:31,840
 production of the gorilla has gone really into it with with a very realistic gorilla suit and

483
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:37,520
 people doing and a person doing generally very realistic gorilla movements. Whereas normally it's

484
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,360
 obviously a person in a gorilla suit. Nice. Spoiler for cabaret, which I can't really have as my

485
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,240
 pick because cabaret is not science fiction. I would I would really like to go and see it though.

486
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,560
 It looks great. The current, the current production of cabaret is unbelievably good and

487
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:04,800
 and it's currently the guy from Hawkeye, right? Yes, Fraffy is the MC and Amy Lenox is the current

488
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,120
 Sally Bowles and it's so good. When you say the guy from Hawkeye, I think Jeremy Renner and I

489
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:16,480
 don't think you mean Jeremy Renner. So it's the I can't remember his character's name, but the

490
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,440
 deaf he's the the one from the gang who is the deaf girls friend from birth. Oh, okay. Okay, cool.

491
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:30,640
 I like that guy. Anyway, that was the Octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me.

492
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:46,560
 It's goodbye from me.

493
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:55,920
 That's probably another another stream deck, fresh jump.

494
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,400
 I'm going to press the back on track button and we're going to get back on track, nailing it.

495
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,760
 We have a back on track button. Wait, yeah, that'd be really useful. How the fuck does that work?

496
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,760
 Yeah, because I need to know where I need to know where we got back on track. If there's a huge

497
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,520
 aggression, I need a button that told me where the end of the aggression was. I mean, in this case,

498
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,360
 it hasn't worked because it has triggered another aggression. Oh, I see. So it's not a button that

499
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,720
 gets us back on track. Like, you know, it's not right. Oh, Liz, if I could have a button that got

500
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:37,920
 you back on track, I mean, like 100% I would. The podcast recording would be much shorter.

501
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,800
 God, if you have got a button that will get me back on track, I could really, really use it in my

502
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,600
 daily life regularly. The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin McLeod
