00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,240
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 44th episode of Octa Thorpe, the podcast for Science Fiction

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,800
 and Science Fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 11th of November 2021.

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott, and I'm Liz Batty.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,600
 We have a letter of comment this week. So Chris Garcia writes to say that it was another

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,960
 wonderful episode and Alison got the correct answer on her second try and as we all know

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,920
 Americans are always wrong the first time. So that's good. You've been promoted to American

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,380
 Alison, so hurrah for that. And he also says that he disagrees with Alison that a single

8
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,720
 person on Twitter can blow things completely out of proportion because if that were the

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,800
 case his calls to have every Big Bang Theory episode forever deleted would have worked.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,600
 And that is a good observation. It's random? Random Big Bang Theory episodes deleted.

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,360
 No, I mean I do like what John says there actually is that it's not that a single person on

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,240
 Twitter can can blow things out of proportion. It's that one person says something in this

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,360
 sort of snowball of lots of people saying what they might have felt but did not otherwise

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,220
 say on Twitter that can sometimes happen. So it looks like everything has suddenly exploded

15
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,020
 but actually maybe it's just one person voicing the opinion that a lot of people go, "Oh actually

16
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,860
 it's more than me who feels this way. This is worth speaking out about."

17
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,620
 Chris also says that he didn't know Shang Chi was set in San Francisco and asks if you can

18
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,860
 see his car in any of the shots. And when I re-watch it Chris, I will let you know, are

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,500
 you still driving that car that was quite beige?

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,320
 Yeah, I think unless like Chris is driving the ween of a beale is going to be hard to

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,080
 pick his car in the shots.

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,760
 And then we got some comments on Facebook from Fran and from Farah.

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,420
 Well I think Fran's is just like one of many comments we've received disagreeing with

24
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,600
 Alison Stunts on Squash is being the only carvable fruit or vegetable because people

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,160
 have reminders that you can carve melons as as Fran said and at the smell of burning melon

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,680
 will haunt her forever. I just think we don't need to give that any more context.

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,920
 This year I have a pumpkin dremel and I am slightly concerned that because normally I

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,280
 carve pumpkins using liner cutting tools and I'm slightly worried that the dremel is going

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
 to create a smell of burning pumpkin flesh in my kitchen.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,480
 As you say we also got comments from other listeners suggesting that we had neglected

31
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,800
 the idea of being able to carve turnips.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,520
 Yes, a Scotsman who should remain nameless because we forgot to ask him if we were allowed

33
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,400
 to quote him. So we're just going to quote him but not tell you who it was. Who could

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,760
 it be? A Scottish person John and Nizno commented that he used to carve nips when he was a nipper

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
 and nips I gather are not squashes.

36
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,480
 There's a thing about American cultural imperialism where people go aha, carving carving pumpkins

37
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,480
 is American cultural imperialism because in Britain it is traditional and it is traditional

38
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:30,080
 to carve turnips or nips which are sweet and they do make quite horrifying and hideous

39
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,880
 Halloween faces but they are also hard as rocks. They are very hard to carve and children

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,080
 have memories of carving turnips but I think in many cases they didn't actually do very

41
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,880
 much with the actual carving themselves, their parents kind of took one look at what they

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,560
 were doing with a very sharp knife and went oh why don't you watch while I finish off

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,360
 your pumpkin dear and pumpkins are much better for carving than turnips. That's why the American

44
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,720
 tradition has taken over because you can carve pumpkins and you do quite well to get a kind

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,040
 of two eyes and a mouth as bad as much as you're going to get out of a turnip even if

46
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:17,400
 you're quite good but you're right they're not squashes.

47
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:25,520
 So we are going to discuss some news from the Eastercon. So the first news is the Eastercon

48
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,680
 has a hotel and this is going to be the Radisson Hotel and Conference Centre London Heathrow

49
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,800
 which fans may know better as the park in. It's the same hotel that was used for Etervium

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,040
 and Disprosium which were the 2019 and 2015 Eastercons both of which I think went smashingly. I had

51
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,360
 a good time both of those. I really like the park in so I am excited about this. Part of

52
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,720
 the reason I like the park in is because I like their breakfast so I'm really hoping

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,080
 that the rebrand hasn't changed the breakfast. What do you two think about this excellent

54
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,920
 news or do you think it's terrible news that's have some hot takes?

55
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,240
 I'm happy enough with the park in. I think it would be nice to have tried somewhere new

56
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,240
 but they couldn't make it work so that's okay and I'm happy enough to go back there.

57
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,840
 There are some access issues with the long corridor at the park in and I'm sure they're

58
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,120
 going to be thinking about how they can mitigate those. I personally like the park in because

59
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,400
 both times we've been at the park in before I've been doing the newsletter and they've

60
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,520
 given us a room right next to the real L bar with an absolutely fucked ton of Powerpoints

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,120
 and internet so that's made me very happy. I actually didn't go to Estercon in 2019.

62
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,800
 I think it isn't true. We're going to end up with like three of the past four in person

63
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,720
 Eastercons. We're actually being in the same hotel but at this point it's like Estercon

64
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,360
 needs a hotel and at this point I think there's just you know you can't really go out about

65
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,040
 it. We've just got to go with whatever hotel is actually feasible and if the formerly parking

66
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,760
 now Radisson is feasible then yeah let's go for it and I actually don't mind Heathrow

67
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,840
 because it is a bit in the middle of nowhere but it also does usually have quite a lot

68
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,680
 of like alternative accommodation in different price ranges which I quite like.

69
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,320
 And it's convenient for foreign travellers. #HintIntLiz

70
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,400
 Here's a shimmy you want to like walk straight off a plane and into Estercon yeah although

71
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
 I think that would be extremely discombobulating experience.

72
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,160
 Ispania did that. Ask her how much, no don't ask her how much she enjoyed it. Ask her why

73
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,800
 there's not a single photo of her at that convention where she's smiling. That's a

74
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,920
 better question to ask. That will more quickly get you to the answers you desire, listen

75
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,440
 to it. But yeah it turns out doing at least a call on eight hours of jet lag in the wrong

76
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,800
 direction isn't fun. We also had some news from Estercon, they announced that they were

77
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:05,960
 going to have a new guest of honour and the new guest of honour is Tasha Suri who is the

78
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,560
 author of the epic fantasy The Jasmine Throne and she has won an award, the Sydney J Brown

79
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,600
 Awards from the British Fantasy Society and has been nominated for the Astounding and

80
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,960
 Locust Awards. So yes I'm excited, I had not heard of her before but she seems really

81
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,640
 cool and I'm going to have to read some of her books. Are we excited about Tasha Suri

82
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,960
 joining the guest of honour roster? Yes I'm excited because I have heard of her and

83
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,280
 I've heard good things about her books but not actually got around to reading any so of

84
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,160
 course this is the perfect excuse for me to get around to reading them.

85
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:46,560
 I observe that she's got a book coming out which is what souls are made of, a young adult

86
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,200
 wuthering heights remix and I kind of thought that wuthering heights was a young adult

87
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,840
 wuthering heights remix so I was fascinated by this but perhaps it was just a young adult

88
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,720
 but when I was a young adult I mean it was entirely read by moody teenage girls.

89
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,760
 Alison was alive in Jane Austen's time. Not quite but not far off.

90
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,800
 It's young adult in the sense that it's a book you would actually give to a young adult

91
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,280
 nowadays whereas I'm not sure I would give wuthering heights to a young adult.

92
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,960
 That was what I was saying but I was saying it with more meanness. High five John.

93
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,120
 So the other sadder piece of Eastcon news is that unfortunately Zencho has had to pull

94
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,880
 out of the guest slot for family reasons and so this is a great shame. I'm a huge fan of

95
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,080
 Zencho so I was looking forward to seeing her at the Eastcon but I hope her and her family

96
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,480
 are well. Yeah pretty much the same it's it's sad she had to withdraw. I was really looking

97
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,120
 forward to seeing her because her books are great and I've seen her on panels and she

98
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,080
 is also great and obviously you know we wish all the best to her and hope she can come

99
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,680
 to a future Eastcon. Yeah no I don't really have anything to add to that. It's just sad.

100
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:03,400
 And then that wraps up the Eastcon news. So listeners we're going to insert a discussion

101
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,880
 we had a couple of months ago now on kind of the topic of Eastcon venues in the future

102
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,080
 with Covid looming large over the community. We wanted to wait until Eastcon announced

103
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,440
 their venue because we didn't want any of what we're about to say to be taken as a device.

104
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,720
 It's all extremely speculative and kind of us just kind of musing and pondering. Also

105
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,400
 two of us are on committees of Eastcon bids and so nothing in this should be taken as having

106
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,720
 anything to do with our work on those bids and either of us are responsible for sight.

107
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,400
 We're both responsible for communications that's quite funny really isn't it?

108
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,800
 It turns out we have similar interests listeners who knew. I would like to know the only time

109
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:51,880
 I was communications from Eastcon I was rubbish at it so. Excellent excellent thank you Liz.

110
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,680
 So now Eastcon has announced that they are in a hotel we can immediately have a long discussion

111
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,960
 about but what if they weren't which will be hopefully interesting to you the listener.

112
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:08,120
 And we will see you for pics after this brief sojourn backwards in time.

113
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,720
 Is the Twilight Zone Music public domain? Because if it is is going here,

114
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,960
 and if it isn't I'll just keep that statement in!

115
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:25,720
 Today we are going to be discussing the future of EasterCon.

116
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,480
 Especially spinning off of a discussion on the UK EastCon community group on Facebook,

117
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,440
 talking about EasterCon in the times of Covid and what needs to happen to EastCon going forward

118
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,560
 sort of over the next five years. So you might think this is too time super timely but as you'll

119
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,640
 actually be listening to it at Christmas or something it won't necessarily be. And when we say the

120
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,400
 future of EasterCon's we should make it clear that we mean the future of EasterCon's in a generic

121
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,560
 sense and not the future of EasterCon's the project that ran for several years a few years ago and

122
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,920
 drew no conclusions of Wound itself up. I think it concluded that lots of people had a lot of

123
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,480
 opinions but none of them were very coherent or consensual and so EasterCon might as well just

124
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,600
 get on with it until the next crisis. And so here we are.

125
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,160
 Do you fair? I made a bunch of graphs for that project and I can't remember whether there was

126
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,000
 an action with me to make more graphs which I have not done and therefore doomed a future

127
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,560
 of EasterCon. No it really did. The project Wound itself up and made a report. It is done.

128
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:40,200
 It was fine. It was correctly managed but it didn't change anything because it concluded that there

129
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,280
 wasn't a balance of people wanting the EasterCon to incorporate. Nick Whitehead on the UK

130
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,560
 EasterCon doing the group asked a question about the site for rectification which is at the time of

131
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:58,120
 the recording the next EasterCon and there was a response from the Reclamation Committee

132
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:05,960
 sort of saying we are in negotiations and we can't really say anything yet but we are working on it.

133
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,720
 And that was about two weeks ago. There has been a flurry of discussion over the last three or four

134
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,200
 days and Liz do you want to kind of outline and summarize the discussion so far?

135
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,000
 Yeah I will try and summarize it and I will say that for this discussion I'm not so much

136
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,200
 interested in all the specific comments there as kind of the broader conversation which hangs off it

137
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:36,120
 which is to me kind of maybe two parts to it. One is that we are in a strange new world

138
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,480
 for venues and so after essentially two years of council events I think the environment for

139
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,520
 finding hotels and booking hotels and making deals and contracts with hotels is probably quite

140
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,840
 different than it was in 2019. That's something that's alluded to in the thread about sites wanting

141
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,760
 wanting big deposits or wanting different styles of deals and I think that's something we're going

142
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:08,360
 to have to deal with going forward and the second one is well and the second thread is that it

143
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,960
 seems clear now that COVID unfortunately it was not COVID-19 and it's there for a year and it's gone

144
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,040
 away and we don't have to think about it anymore but it might be that we have to make general

145
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,840
 adjustments and think about things for several maybe many years to come and it's worth thinking

146
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,320
 about what adjustments we can make and what adjustments we might want to make and what adjustments we

147
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,880
 might want to make that would help very much with say the COVID situation but would kind of make

148
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,120
 the EasterCon maybe not the EasterCon anymore and so there are those two things to discuss.

149
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:47,400
 This is very relevant to the work that I'm doing for EasterCon 2023 where we are explicitly

150
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,320
 starting to think about asking the community what is it that you want from an EasterCon? What things

151
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,000
 make it EasterCon like and you know if EasterCon turned out to be a

152
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,800
 convention limited to 100 socially distanced people in a tent in Florida would that still be

153
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,920
 EasterCon and you know I think most people probably say it wouldn't be but there's probably some

154
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,400
 intermediate points where it would still be the EasterCon and what does that look like?

155
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,760
 One of the things kind of that has come up in this thread is talking about whether or not it's

156
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:29,160
 going to be possible for EasterCon to kind of continue in hotels so do we want to talk about

157
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:36,200
 kind of the alternatives to hotels and what that might imply for EasterCon going forward?

158
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:44,120
 Sorry yeah I think we do. EasterCon has flirted with the idea of going to a holiday camp. It has

159
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:52,280
 actually gone to student accommodation but only once. There are a number of sites dotted around

160
00:14:52,280 --> 00:15:00,680
 the UK that are kind of they were colleges owned by large organizations but they do still exist

161
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,000
 and they are sites where you could run conventions not necessarily EasterCon but certainly there are

162
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,080
 sites of that kind and all of those seem plausible and then people have actually said well maybe we

163
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:22,920
 should reconstitute the EasterCon as a festival and put it in a field with tents rather than

164
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,640
 in a hotel. So yeah I think that's kind of the space of that. I don't know and then obviously

165
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,800
 there's virtual conventions as well but I think most people agree that the EasterCon could be

166
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,520
 physically we'd like it to be physical if it's possible. I think it would be interesting to revisit

167
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,600
 the idea of sort of student accommodation type things because I think it is a while since EasterCon's

168
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,840
 been there and my impression is that a lot of the sort of student accommodation places have gone a

169
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,640
 bit more market and mainly things like for instance on-suite bathrooms and you know beds which are

170
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,560
 not extremely uncomfortable single beds. So it's probably worth investigating what's there. A lot of

171
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,680
 these places have double beds even and quite a lot of them have a mix so they have quite a lot of

172
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,240
 double rooms and they still have quite a lot of single rooms and so you'll be able to offer things

173
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,760
 at different price points which I think would be quite welcome to people because it's clear that

174
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,240
 the traditional way of saying oh it's going to be ex-emmowed if you're in a twin or a double and

175
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,920
 and somewhat less than ex if you're as a single that's not the way the hotels work. It hasn't been

176
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,360
 for some years so it's becoming very expensive to attend a single person unless you're prepared to

177
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,560
 share. And the other thing they may also have is you know some student accommodation may have

178
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,400
 flats with kind of multiple bedrooms in one kind of complex which could be a quite affordable option

179
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:52,200
 for families or for friends who want to share. Multiple bedrooms in a kind of complex with a

180
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,480
 kitchen and I think that's very attractive. Certainly I've self-catered for a number of

181
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,520
 conventions in the past and found it a very good way for doing a longer convention. I think

182
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:08,840
 three days is about as much as I'm prepared to eat entirely hotel and restaurant food without

183
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:15,000
 becoming quite unhappy about that and self-catering is an option for people so I think this is the

184
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,920
 sort of thing that we should be exploring. And this is this actually ties into conversations that

185
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:27,800
 being had in academia as well kind of in parallel because a lot of academic conferences are seeing

186
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:34,520
 the benefits now to being able to use university accommodation. So when I started going to conferences

187
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,760
 as a student most of the conferences were held in university accommodation but they had like

188
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,000
 hotels or arrangements with B&Bs because the student accommodation wasn't really up to much

189
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 and that has been changing as I've been in academia so I do think that is something

190
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,160
 the universities are trying to do as an extra profit center effectively is make their student

191
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,560
 accommodation more appealing for the sorts of events that might once use the space and East

192
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:05,880
 Com probably does fit into that bill. But one of the things about university accommodation is that

193
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,680
 although your rooms are probably still enclosed and your conference space still has some rooms that

194
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:19,480
 you need to manage the corridors in university accommodation tend to be outside and that actually

195
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,120
 helps with you've got more ventilation you will move from unless unless the conference center is

196
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,320
 really grander than I think it is you will still have a certain amount of moving around outside

197
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,720
 which does mean that you will get wet but also means that they will get some fresh air and I

198
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,280
 am a hearty believer of fresh air. I have several comments one is that I am on currently as we

199
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:49,320
 recall this I am on day nine of eating exclusively in a hotel and it is starting to wear a little bit

200
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,720
 which is why I'm going to the supermarket in half an hour. Two are they actually corridors if they're

201
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:01,320
 outside? Oh good question no and and I think that is basically one of the main trade-offs is trying

202
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:09,400
 to work out the extent to which the outside bits are mitigatable that's one of the huge challenges

203
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,000
 I think but I think it's a challenge we can meet and I also think having the bits in between

204
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,800
 parts of the convention being outside will make it more Covid secure and that segues very nicely

205
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:28,920
 to how about we had East Com in a tent? Yeah so one of the options that people have suggested for

206
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:36,280
 East Com is that it runs like a festival and I think unlike Liz or John, Liz do you do festivals?

207
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:44,200
 Not really no. No so unlike Liz and John I really really like festivals I quite like camping I don't

208
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,280
 camping is not as comfortable as hotels but it is quite nice to be able to drink a vast amount of

209
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,400
 alcohol and then sink into a tent rather than having to worry about getting somewhere else that

210
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,560
 isn't the festival so it's kind of like everyone gets to stay in the convention campsite. It's nice

211
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,840
 waking up in the morning in a campsite because it's kind of clean and fresh and lovely but

212
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,520
 there's quite a lot of big butts here festivals come in a couple of different flavours so they either

213
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,280
 have all of their stuff outside in which case you need to deal with rain but you also need to

214
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,240
 deal with the fact that outside is a terrible environment for the spoken word outside is a

215
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,240
 brilliant environment for music it sounds amazing it looks amazing you get to dance in a field it's

216
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,240
 great it's really not such a good environment for the spoken word and so you find that a lot of

217
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:42,040
 festivals have smaller stages for spoken word events and most East Com things are spoken word

218
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,840
 events the thing about these these smaller stages is that they're often enclosed they're often

219
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:55,400
 actually tents with walls and that's just a room like any other room so you you immediately lose

220
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,640
 some of your benefit and yes you can take the walls off and improve the covid secureness of

221
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,240
 your site by having mockeys with open side walls and we had that at the festival I was at last

222
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,760
 weekend and it does help a lot especially if it's cold and windy but you know it's going to be cold

223
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,840
 and windy at Easter Easter is a terrible time we would probably have to move to the summer

224
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:25,080
 and then you're going to discover that all of the event infrastructure in the UK is in use all summer

225
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,800
 every summer that's how it works so you and everybody else is is bidding on event infrastructure

226
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:37,320
 and and also we would need an expert we need to basically co-opt I think Linda Kriekki is the only

227
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,440
 fan who does this for a living but we need to find somebody who could then contract an events

228
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,120
 management company to do it for us we would not be able to run it the way we run other bits of

229
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,280
 Easter Com by by well I know so-and-so's got a suitable hanger he can bring it's not going to work

230
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,680
 you you need to you need to subcontract that and at that point you're probably into festival price

231
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,360
 so which should be it's okay no so that that was one of the suggestions on the on the Facebook

232
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,360
 group it was kind of mooted that we could move to campsites which might be a more affordable

233
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:16,120
 option but I think the key problem there is that campsites tend to be in use at bank holidays and

234
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,160
 when it's nice enough whether to have an event at a campsite yeah so there's an alternative that we

235
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:27,240
 could be on a large fixed campsite but again they're full all summer Easter Com thrives in part

236
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,880
 because we use hotels at a point where no one else wants to use the hotels because most hotels

237
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,280
 the conference spaces are outdated for professionals who are not going to professional conferences

238
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,440
 over these two weekend and so we can sometimes get cheap accommodation so it might be that we

239
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,120
 are actually not going to find that moving to outdoor locations suits us particularly well

240
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,760
 side-line this is much less true than it used to be yeah I think it is still more true for hotels

241
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,480
 than for place-like balance and pondings that we are currently in less competition for those spaces

242
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:07,000
 yes we are not the only hobbyist it used to be that we were really quite unusual as being a hobbyist

243
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,720
 conference over Easter but that's not true anymore there are quite a lot and we're not even a particularly

244
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,200
 big one so it's also absolutely true if you look at like holiday camps like the butlins and the

245
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,600
 ponthins type thing that every weekend in the off season is a different weekend interest group

246
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,760
 and that's basically what keeps them going between the the school holidays when they are

247
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,120
 extremely expensive and full but even even so there are that many kind of special interest groups I

248
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,880
 think that you might even find a free weekend that there isn't something on at the ponthins

249
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:44,120
 no I think we could do a deal with a holiday camp if that was what people wanted but it would

250
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,960
 have to be an off season I don't think it could be east weekend because it's in the school holidays

251
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,360
 EasterCon one of the core features of EasterCon is that it is a four-day weekend that everybody

252
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:00,680
 in the UK pretty much gets off apart from Vickers and and that's been quite a good thing

253
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,640
 for creating the community obviously people can take holiday around

254
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,480
 conventions and quite a lot of our members are retired or work flexibly and can take

255
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,480
 can take days off anyway so we I don't think the commitment to Easter is as absolute as it has

256
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,680
 been but I think it would be quite hard not to run it over Easter and also I think there are still

257
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,080
 sites I you know it's not that there are no sites it's that there are no perfect sites

258
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,880
 but there are a lot of sites that are more perfect than ponthins one of the things that comes up in

259
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:39,560
 the thing is that um Kate Solomon said that some affluent class fandom will grumble about not being

260
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,320
 in a four-star hotel and at this point I would like to wheel out my privilege and say that one of my

261
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,440
 absolute things I like when I'm staying away from home is to have an ensuite bathroom and it is my

262
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,960
 understanding it is difficult to have that in a tent and so I do quite like I don't need to be in a

263
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,280
 four-star hotel but but I do I do I think a campsite would be the point at which I was like do I

264
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,920
 really want to keep going to Easter cons and that would be a shame that there is a solution for you

265
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:14,920
 which is campervan hire oh but I mean it's expensive but I mean I think I would turn to the people who

266
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:21,720
 go oh I'm not prepared to be in a tent because portal is and say campervan hire you know if

267
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,640
 if that's something that's really that's really a deal breaker but you might find that it's not as

268
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,840
 bad as you think portal is not as bad as you think yeah but I don't like the idea that there's this

269
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,920
 idea that I can drink a lot of beer and then fall into my tent sort of falls over if I then have to

270
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,920
 keep running out of my tent to go and find the portal. Okay this is there's probably too much

271
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,760
 information here there's a whole process whereby you go to the loo before you leave the festival

272
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,080
 site then you go to the loo again just before you get back to your tent and then you're okay

273
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,400
 and until you wake up in the morning and and then very occasionally you wake up in the night going

274
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,480
 oh shit do you need to go to the loo but then you keep a pair of crocs with you as well as your

275
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,360
 regular shoes so you can just shove crocs on. You can't you can't piss into a croc all of the

276
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,720
 way you would fall out yeah and to be fair people do also take toilet tents with them and things

277
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,760
 like that you know it's not totally there are there are solutions. I am also in the category of

278
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,240
 people who don't enjoy driving home from convention so so a camp around would not but I take your

279
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,720
 point that this is not necessarily insurmountable and if East Kong did change to festivals I would

280
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,680
 give it a very good go before I gave up you are you are right that I would be exploring all of these

281
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,280
 things. I might also contract as well as contract with somebody to actually run the site for me

282
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:42,840
 which we would definitely have to do. I might also contract a glamping company to provide us with

283
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,360
 like the I mean so the ones we had this weekend was the last weekend which were absolutely lovely

284
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,440
 I'm going to say who they are they're a company called Norfolk Bells and they did a lovely bell

285
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:59,880
 tents they didn't have support but but the more expensive glamping also often has a glamping

286
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,280
 area where you have your glamping tents and proper flush toilets and showers and maybe a central

287
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:14,040
 tent with a concierge and charging stations and electricity so you can plug your straightening

288
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:20,600
 arms in and things like that so so glamping comes in a number of different systems and I think I

289
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,200
 definitely think if we were doing an Easter con in a field we'd have charging facilities it would be

290
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,560
 one of the things that we would do you know we'd have electrical power in a place where you could go

291
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,600
 so you do there's a security risk but I mean we'd be quite small for a festival we're big for

292
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,600
 a we're quite big for a hotel but we'll call us more for a festival. Well you get you get the

293
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,120
 thing where you know you you lock your phone in a locker to charge it and then come back and get

294
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,960
 it won't you or something you know there's there's ways to overcome this and we'd already be having

295
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,040
 to contract with people to help us with the electronics anyway because you know Eastercon cannot

296
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,800
 itself set up you know electricity in a field. The people I would go to are the people who run

297
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:06,280
 this kind of like this kind of like nerdy hackers festivals in fields and I think they they boot

298
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:12,280
 strap at all using volunteers so they could give us some learnings and they probably also know

299
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:20,760
 what you need to do to get enough internet into a field. Yeah it's like is it EMF camp I think

300
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:26,200
 I'll look that up and we can make sure it goes in yeah yeah something like that. I mean I'm not

301
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,080
 totally averse to the idea of doing a convention of field because I quite like being in fields but

302
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,480
 I think I like being in fields but I don't like being in fields in March that's a problem. Yeah no

303
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,120
 we definitely did not a Easter if it's if it's a if it's a field if it's a festival a festival type

304
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,080
 thing then you do it in the summer. I would say I think we were quite worried at the Harrogate

305
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:54,200
 Eastercon because there was one access issue where to avoid a flight of stairs you had to go outside

306
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,120
 and I remember we were very concerned about that because of inclement weather and I think that didn't

307
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,200
 turn out to be too much of a problem. Am I remembering correctly because I wasn't really running the

308
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,600
 con by that point? It wasn't really too much for a common problem because most people decided they'd

309
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,680
 cope with the flight of stairs and we actually did have golf buggies to take people around and

310
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,560
 that was the the hotel had golf buggies and and drove people back and forth and the people who

311
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,840
 used it like that service and thought it was a good accommodation. I think it was much harder for

312
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,040
 the people who who could walk a few steps but walking up and down a flight repeatedly was

313
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,440
 was difficult for them and I think we could have done a lot more to encourage those people to make

314
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,920
 use of the buggies but it's certainly true that outside does have quite a lot of access issues that

315
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,120
 are not immediately. I mean it's normally pretty flat and you could you could have scooters. Scooters

316
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,440
 work much better in fields than they do in hotel corridors. You said scooters work much better in

317
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,160
 fields than hotel corridors? You mean the other way around? No, they're fine in festivals that there

318
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,280
 are festival friendly scooters. Oh okay. The only problem is that you do get people who have never

319
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,560
 used a scooter before who have drunk 18 points of world worth success and those people are not safe

320
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,840
 and I think we would probably have to say that if you are using a scooter then we would expect you

321
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,040
 to very much limit the amount that you drink and I understand that that is infringing on people's

322
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,800
 liberties somewhat but it would be important for safety. Yeah, designated scooter drivers.

323
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,720
 I mean one thing I didn't say is that the best example of a convention you know that ran in a

324
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:36,680
 sort of semi-field situation was uh blocked com. It's where lots of time running around in the dark

325
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:43,480
 doing your fucking scavenger hunt I think. It was like scavenger hunt. Okay so we were when I say a

326
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:51,080
 semi-field this was the civil service college so it was really pretty nice. It was some primitive

327
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,760
 in some ways and some of the rooms were better than others so some of the bedrooms were still

328
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:01,640
 kind of hard single beds but but it's quite nice and we were over Maybank holiday so it was

329
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,280
 quite nice weather as well and people went swimming and things. Yeah in the sort of model that of

330
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,240
 you know my bedroom was in one room and then I went outside and crossed like some green space

331
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,080
 in order to get to the convention center bit but yes my room there was lovely and we had lovely time

332
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:23,240
 running around outside in the dark for some reason eating pizza outside but we weren't supposed to

333
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,760
 have got pizzas delivered but we did. Hey I don't think they minded I think we were relaxed. Yeah

334
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,200
 I think it's one of the advantages of these sorts of sites is that they are much more relaxed than

335
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,760
 hotels about you bringing food and drinking because students bring food and drinking obviously

336
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,080
 and the notion that they shouldn't let people hasn't really occurred to them. No it's good but

337
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,360
 no it was it was basically fine and they were very keen to secure custom but I think since then the

338
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:54,680
 entire site has been sold for housing really I think it's longer but I'd always wanted to run

339
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,200
 a convention at the civil service college I've always thought oh that would be a fantastic site

340
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,680
 for a con and it's safe we didn't have to spend anything on tech because one of the nice things

341
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,880
 about academic sites is that every single room in your academic site is set up for the sorts of

342
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,360
 things you want to do it at least to go apart from maybe put a big band on and I think if I was

343
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,440
 running on a site like that I might just go no we won't do that but they often have theatres

344
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,440
 and you can use if they have a theatre you can use the theatre for that sort of thing. Yeah one of

345
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,840
 the things that came up on the discussion thread on facebook was basically one fan with access

346
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,560
 requirements was kind of discussing the difficulties of moving outside there were some people in the

347
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,320
 discussion who were not taking that as seriously as they might have done that I think that would be a

348
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,240
 big thing you'd need to think about but I'm not sure whether it's intractable or whether it's just

349
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,840
 difficult that would be something we'd find out if we ever did it but as we've noted SFX

350
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,280
 Weekender already uses a site like this and so presumably they already have some expertise in

351
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,200
 what the issues here are and how you might want to mitigate them so it might be that we could

352
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,160
 pick their brains if it ever did come to that. We're talking about the possibility of doing a

353
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:05,720
 COVID-safe convention here or a more COVID-safe convention and given that people are going oh well

354
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:14,280
 it's fine to exclude every child under 12 to make our convention more COVID secure I think you may

355
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,840
 have to say oh actually there are access needs that can't be met if we do this this is something

356
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,600
 that we will be deliberately choosing but certainly access is harder for outside but you know there

357
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:32,520
 are people who like festivals who become disabled who go to extraordinary lengths to get to festivals

358
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,520
 with their disability so it is doable it is just quite difficult and it would be an awful it would

359
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:44,920
 be a huge change for EasterCon fans who are who are used to used to hotel spaces. I mean I would say

360
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:50,840
 the excluding children are 12 it's a thing that I assume is temporary like will probably be for

361
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,080
 this year only until we basically get around testing and licensing vaccines in small children

362
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,560
 whereas I think I was thinking you know if this is like three or five years down the line and we

363
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,120
 still need to be trying to do good ventilation and social distancing how is that compatible kind of

364
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,240
 long term that might be more of a digression than we need and I was saying the SFX weekenders

365
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,120
 I think the thing with the SFX weekenders are the ones I went to is the sites are large but usually

366
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:22,200
 very flat the kind of single story type things basically all on tarmac and so the issue is more

367
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:28,360
 I think the distance and I'm not sure how any kind of accessible shallows they have but I suspect

368
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,000
 the ones they do have are very close into the central facilities. I would just say something I

369
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,600
 want to add is I've just looked up SFX weekender and it happens in early February in North Wales

370
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,560
 so like there is clearly there is clearly an extent to which you can do these things at times

371
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:49,000
 when you might think the weather might be in Clement. Yeah I was talking about a Greenfield site a

372
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,400
 festival SFX weekender is in a holiday camp which is like that there are no tents involved

373
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:02,280
 shallows and central buildings so it's quite primitive in places and the site is very large.

374
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,960
 Okay cool. I mean I would also say that yeah they do do them in February in a holiday camp

375
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,040
 and it is fucking freezing. I mean there's no getting around they should like shivering in

376
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,080
 the queue for vision dips. Oh no but my point is that they still do it it doesn't stop them.

377
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:24,920
 Doesn't stop them no but it does have some downsides. This segues into a couple of questions on

378
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,240
 kind of the traditions around Eastacon and whether or not those traditions need to be more

379
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:35,160
 codified so one of the questions that comes up in that thread about future of Eastacon venues is that

380
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:41,080
 there was one hotel that was asking for a £200,000 deposit before allowing Eastacon to book the

381
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,920
 space and that is the sort of money that if there was a central Eastacon organization that managed

382
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,680
 the pass along funds we might be able to do that but like certainly not with the way that we do it

383
00:35:52,680 --> 00:36:01,880
 at the moment and also kind of if there was a codified Eastacon Constitution would that constitution

384
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,280
 demand that you held Eastacon at Easter and would that prevent moving the convention in

385
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:14,200
 summer for the warmer weather and the outside? So what do we think the implications are for all

386
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,600
 of this and kind of the traditions of Eastacon and does this have any bearing on the arguments around

387
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,800
 you know does there need to be a written or a codified Eastacon Constitution?

388
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,640
 That does not need to be a written or codified Eastacon Constitution.

389
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,800
 I think the hotels that are asking for £200,000 deposits are taking the piss because that's not

390
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,760
 normal in the industry and it's a nonsense and if you went and said I'm thinking of holding a

391
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,520
 wedding and they said oh we need £200,000 deposit you've come off it mate you know it's just nonsense

392
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,480
 and I think that's that's part of how you go about managing the negotiations.

393
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,280
 Hotels are very skittish because of the lack of leadership from government on supporting venues

394
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,920
 for events. Now there has been a scheme announced it might only apply to festivals but it might apply

395
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,480
 to events generally to provide COVID insurance for 2020. So if the government 2022, if the government

396
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,840
 is going to pick up COVID COVID cancellation insurance for events then that is something

397
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,400
 that we might be able to take advantage of but that's the reason they were asking for a huge deposit.

398
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,320
 It's not because they would normally do that it's because they're kind of trying not to go bust

399
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,160
 and go in oh but we can't afford the risk that this event will fold a couple of weeks out leaving

400
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,560
 us with nothing. So I feel like if you did have I think this is a very good example of why you

401
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,600
 don't want to codify constitution there because if you have a if you give east-coder constitution

402
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:49,240
 then what things do you mandate in it and of course Wilcon went the route of mandating very

403
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,280
 very little in the constitution you have to have the hugos you have to have as a business meeting

404
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,960
 and that's it and even so they found that COVID actually created circumstances they hadn't really

405
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,360
 considered for the constitution and I don't know that they've quite managed to sort those out.

406
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,960
 So I think you might you probably wouldn't want if you did write a constitution freeze to

407
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,280
 card you wouldn't probably want to specify that it had to be a t-ster. I think we would probably

408
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,480
 look favorably on a bid that came along and said well we've got a great site but we're going to have

409
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:29,640
 to move it to Whitweek. I don't know people might struggle. What's Whitweek? Whitweek is the late

410
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,360
 the late Maybank holiday, Huitsun and it is the most expected it's very unlikely that it

411
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,080
 needs to cause everyone but going to move there because it is the most expensive week of the year

412
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:45,960
 for holidays and of course everyone holidays in the UK now which is so hotels are finding that

413
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,040
 some hotels are finding that they can't actually sell their rooms in a way that they weren't expecting

414
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:58,280
 to. So it's very it's complicated. I think I agree with Alison in that in some ways it is nice to give

415
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:05,400
 each convention the freedom to kind of do what it likes. I think it's I don't want to you know

416
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,520
 yeah prescribe what they have to do and therefore stop them you know experimenting with different

417
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:17,720
 things. I think it is also true that Eastercons do follow a lot of unwritten rules and I worry

418
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:24,280
 that kind of having a big set of unwritten rules that you kind of don't really know about but sort

419
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:30,120
 of have to follow because everyone has for the past end years is also quite off-putting because

420
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,760
 it's kind of this big burden of institutional knowledge that you then have to try and pick

421
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,480
 up on before you can really get thoroughly stuck into the Eastercon and I also worry that if

422
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,040
 if an Eastercon does come along and do something which is not a whole part of you know any constitution

423
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,440
 but it's one of these unwritten rules that they might end up with quite a lot of backlash.

424
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,440
 I mean I think one thing Follycon did that was quite controversial at the time was we changed how

425
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,280
 the art auction worked didn't we? I think we had a silent auction. Yeah which is a time I think

426
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,800
 there was some push back against but ended up working fine as it was. I mean people were unhappy

427
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:11,480
 about it and some artists didn't exhibit but we had a good art show and people made more money

428
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:18,440
 than I have previously so. No and I think I see what Liz means like I think that it cuts both ways

429
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,000
 which is it gives you the freedom to do what you might want to do or might need to do but it also

430
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,680
 gives you enough rope to hang yourself with if you do like inadvertently decide something that

431
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:37,320
 the community generally is a bit put off by. I wonder whether having it at the Easter weekend is

432
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:43,720
 one of those things that would put people off. I really like having a Easter and I think

433
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:49,880
 so again with my academic hour on the brilliant thing about Easter is that universities tend to get

434
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,560
 days off either side of the bank holidays so it does mean you have like a date pack

435
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,200
 a date to travel and then a date to come back and decompress which is really really nice.

436
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,080
 I don't know like obviously academia is not a large enough segment of the random for that to be a huge

437
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:10,200
 thing but for me it's a pretty large segment of the fandom. It's a huge huge it's much bigger

438
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,400
 segment of the fandom than it was when I got into fandom. Yeah but I do wonder whether

439
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,160
 if you tried doing it a different date you would find very abruptly that was one of the

440
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,760
 more important than written rules. I don't know. I think if you tried to run Easter come not at Easter

441
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,800
 there would be a convention there would be a convention happening at Easter because people would

442
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,760
 just kind of go oh there's a void I can put a con there it's got four days it'll be good.

443
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,160
 No and like I've always wanted to see a real life schism so that might be fun.

444
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:50,200
 The year we ran the first fully con at the same time as the traditional fans were absolutely up in

445
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:57,160
 arms at these crappy media fans taking over their lovely Easter con the media fans were running

446
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,360
 another convention that weekend because Easter con wasn't anything like media enough for us that

447
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,600
 there was a convention called Elador that I think lots of people we know went to including Clara

448
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,520
 Mark and that happened over the Easter weekend through four years I think before

449
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,760
 before folding and that was a media con. It was more me it was still still towards the

450
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,680
 fanish end of media cons. I think it was probably most like redemption and now obviously the redemption

451
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,360
 and Elador people will come along and say no it wasn't like that at all but I think it was

452
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,240
 closer to redemption than to to what we think of as gate shows so it wasn't a gate show.

453
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,920
 I think one other aspect we hadn't thought about about moving from Easter is essentially the only

454
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,600
 time that people with children can take their children away for a four-day weekend is during

455
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,640
 one of the school holidays and Easter is probably the only one where you could run a con at reasonable

456
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,520
 prices in a hotel that is part of the school holidays so I think that's that as well.

457
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,320
 You know if we moved it to a random weekend and we've tried to pick a random four-day weekend in

458
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,360
 April or you know June or something that wasn't a holiday that would be an issue.

459
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,680
 No that's actually a really good point I hadn't really thought about that but I guess Easter

460
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,720
 doesn't just tick the box of four-day weekend that you don't have to take any leave to attend

461
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:15,400
 the hotel might not be hugely expensive for but it also ticks the box of in the some holidays so

462
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,080
 parents can come. Not some holidays sorry in the school holidays so the parents can come and that

463
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:27,880
 I guess is pretty much the only time at which all of those things are true so it may well be that

464
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:34,760
 moving away is is difficult but then you know World Cons and NASFIX manage so I guess there's a

465
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,160
 counter-argument which is if other countries can have their flagship conventions at different

466
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,360
 times of year maybe the UK could do. I guess world contents be over the Labor Day weekend and I don't

467
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:51,400
 know what the US school holidays are like but that might be a factor. It hasn't been for some years

468
00:43:51,400 --> 00:44:00,760
 so World Cons sort of lost the Labor Day weekend because they were having trouble getting sites

469
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,000
 because that weekend had become very popular for conferences and although traditionally schools

470
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,920
 didn't restart in the US until after Labor Day that's no longer true in many parts of the US

471
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,680
 so people were finding that kids were back in school and then now I think World Cons

472
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,280
 be mostly on summer weekends for several years at this point. Of course when the World Cons comes

473
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,640
 to the UK mostly I don't know if this is true I might be talking bollocks. Was Lunkon over the

474
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,720
 back holiday weekend? Well no I don't think so it was mid-August right? The Glasgow World Cons were

475
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,560
 over the back holiday which is the obvious place to put it. If you go to lunkon3.org you get a gambling

476
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:48,440
 website these days. I would have kept the website. It was 14th to the 18th of August.

477
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,600
 Yeah so it was the week before. I can't remember if it was but I mean there was a reason we had

478
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,240
 to do it on that weekend because that was when we could get the Excel I think. What I can't remember

479
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,120
 was whether that was it was it within the school holiday still I guess it would be. Yeah mid-August

480
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:07,560
 is. I think that was quite important to us. Just one very quick remaining question I have

481
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:13,480
 which is we were talking earlier about the reason that Hojals have been asking for those huge deposits

482
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:19,480
 that we referenced earlier is probably due to the increased risk which is almost certainly true.

483
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:26,520
 Does the increased risk make it riskier for convention committees to run east-comp?

484
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,640
 And like how can that be mitigated? Is there a way or is it just we have to shrug out as Roald doesn't

485
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:42,360
 hope? I'm hoping that the fact that there's a Wilcon coming to the UK in 2024 probably that will

486
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:49,320
 have a budget that for exceeds that of any Eastercon and what will happen is if Eastercons

487
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:55,160
 around that are struggling will kind of get the Wilcon to lose our losses in their rounding

488
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:01,560
 figures sorry Esther. A more professional way of saying that would be that Eastercon one of the

489
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,720
 nice things about the Eastercon community is that on the rare occasions that something has gone wrong

490
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:12,200
 the community has rallied round to ensure that large losses have not been sustained. But there's

491
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,360
 a risk. I mean Eastercon running has a kind of inherent risk in it but then everything does.

492
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,160
 And one of the one of the big arguments for incorporating is that if you incorporate that risk

493
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,560
 does not settle onto the committee members but it is still there in the community because if

494
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:31,640
 Eastercon goes bust if we made it a company and then the company went bankrupt that would make it

495
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:37,400
 much harder for people to run successive conventions. That's a good point. It's one of those things

496
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,160
 where I'm sort of vaguely aware when running Eastercons that there might be some like repercussions

497
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:48,120
 for the committee should we have no money and go bust but I sort of assumed that at that point

498
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,400
 there will be enough kind of community rallying around and bits of pass along and so on. I mean

499
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:59,400
 assuming that you know the Eastercon goes bust you know not through the fault of the committee

500
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,080
 being terrible and spending all the money on bouncy castles or something like that you know.

501
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,440
 I assume that we'd all sort of go around and help but I mean when you're getting into some

502
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,400
 like we want an enormous deposit because you can't get insurance that becomes more of an issue. And

503
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,960
 also all the Eastercons I have worked on where I've been high enough to be paying attention. They've

504
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,560
 all had you know insurance in case of you know disaster and not being able to hold the convention.

505
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,680
 That's fair. Yeah.

506
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:32,040
 So let's do picks. Alison you go first.

507
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:41,800
 I went and saw Dune and I did it in the cinema because I kind of, I was conditioned by Lawrence

508
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,680
 of Arabia as a small child and I kind of think that if you're going to see a movie about desert

509
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,000
 scenery you should probably go and do it on the big screen. It wasn't as bad as some other people's

510
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,440
 cinema experiences I might docked again. Quite enjoyed it. Dune is pretty good probably worth

511
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:04,040
 seeing on the big screen. It is only half the novel and in order to I think avoid David Lynch's

512
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:10,040
 problem of having massive gobs of exposition. Villeneuve's decided to not have any exposition at all

513
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,080
 which is fine if you've read the book. If you haven't you probably aren't going to realise

514
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:19,640
 what's going on because nothing is explained and when things are explained that are absolutely

515
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:26,600
 critical they do it with a very with a thundering score over the top of it. But I might like to

516
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,360
 anyway lots of good performances. Look forward to the second one.

517
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,840
 Liz put a comment on the Dune soundtrack in the show notes listeners and I'm going to

518
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:43,240
 reproduce it here. Did that come through? It worked alright for me. I definitely heard

519
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:52,360
 a good thundering. That is the inception. Blah and that was Liz's soul comment in the show notes

520
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,840
 on I was like fair enough so is it my soundboard now. I don't really have a second pick but my

521
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,080
 second pick is just to say that I watched Black Widow last night and because I've been quite rude

522
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,040
 about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I quite liked it. I don't want to say I really quite liked it a lot.

523
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:16,440
 I especially like the way in which Natasha's sleeper cell is depicted as a sort of

524
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:25,320
 screwed up version of The Incredibles and they have the like most hilarious family superhero

525
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,040
 shenanigans I think I have ever seen in a movie and I really like that a lot.

526
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,800
 Nice. I have not seen Dune. Oh my go and see it at the cinema but it is like over two and a

527
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:41,560
 half hours long which is usually my threshold for not seeing things in the cinema. Oh yes it's

528
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:48,760
 it is a test of your middle aged bladder control is Dune. Bring back into missions that's what I say

529
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,360
 but I did I saw Black Widow in the cinema and I very much enjoyed it. I thought I mean I love

530
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,440
 Rachel Weiss and I love David Harbour and I love I hadn't seen the lady who plays her sister

531
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,880
 before but I loved her. Florence Pugh she's amazing she's really really good absolutely top talent.

532
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:10,440
 Florence Pugh is in Little Women with Timothy Chalamet so there you go tie up.

533
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,360
 She is amazing in Little Women as Amy. Timothy Chalamet actually is much less impressive in Little

534
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,960
 Women than he was in Dune. I thought he was fantastic in Dune. I'm confused as to whether I'm going to

535
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,160
 like Dune because I love Derival but hated Blade Runner 2049. I have no idea which end of the

536
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,840
 Villeneuve scale this movie is going to be on. It depends what you hated about Blade Runner 2049 I

537
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:39,960
 think. I think mostly the the the writing acting and direction. It was very pretty. Well I think

538
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:47,640
 it says a different writer and different actors but the same director so let's see. Okay. The things

539
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:57,320
 I didn't like about Blade Runner 2049 were largely about the agency of women in the film and the

540
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:03,320
 directorial approach to that and this is also a problem with Dune just because Dune is a novel

541
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:09,720
 written 60 years ago by a white guy and and it's kind of like Dune works within that and it does

542
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,760
 lots of things to try to get over some of that but it kind of you know it's got its source material

543
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,000
 and and if that's a problem then it remains a problem. So one of the particular problems with

544
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,760
 Blade Runner 2049 is Villeneuve's male gaze and although there's a little bit of that in this film

545
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,600
 it's not irritating in the same way or at least it didn't irritate me in the same way. It's not as

546
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,920
 good a film as a rival but then there aren't very many such films that are as good as a rival and

547
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,120
 it's also only half the book so we need to see Dune part two to really draw conclusions about

548
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,440
 where he's going with all of this and he said he wants to do Dune Messiah as well so he can do

549
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,760
 the whole story of pull. I think that's fair because I think some of the like more male

550
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,160
 gay-Z bits of Dune are explicitly because they're kind of from Paul's perspective and so they help

551
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,200
 remind us like who his character is and I've now forgotten what was your other point about Dune

552
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:06,040
 about Blade Runner? I remember now which is that yeah I think Dune you know basically gender swaps

553
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:11,560
 on the characters in order to improve that and it works perfectly well. I went to Croydon

554
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:16,280
 and attended an in-person gaming event with 43 other people. That's my pick.

555
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:24,120
 What sort of gaming event? I'll give you three guesses. Oh it would be an Arkham horror thing.

556
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,920
 Yes guess one correct. It was a thing called Arkham Knights.

557
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:37,240
 And how did it how's your sanity? My sanity I came out alive and they kind of gave a lot of swag away

558
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,320
 and they did loads of games and it was good. We played a thing called the blob the blob that ate

559
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,440
 everything. The blob ate our ability to eat food and drink which was very annoying for the cafe

560
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,320
 we were playing in because the way to skip coming around and saying do you want anything we're like

561
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:54,040
 we can't blob-et it and explaining that to someone who doesn't know the game is a bit complicated.

562
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,400
 But it was very fun and we won and it was good there's a big group photo that I'll put in the

563
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:04,360
 show notes but at this event I played a game which is new which is called Unfathomable and it is a

564
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:12,040
 social deduction game set on a 1910s ocean liner called The Atlantica and you are crossing from

565
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:17,720
 Southampton to Boston when you are attacked by deep ones and the game is basically you fending

566
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:24,360
 off these deep ones as you try and get to Boston. But some of you are in fact deep one hybrids and

567
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:31,080
 you are working against the group to try and sow discord and mayhem. And if this sounds like a

568
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,080
 familiar premise to you and you have played the battle cycle act like a board game that is because

569
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,720
 it is indeed based off the battle act like a board game. It's a lot better than the battle

570
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,160
 cycle act like a board game so if you've played that and you're like oh god I hate that game

571
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:48,440
 it's so badly paced and it takes too long they have fixed the pacing issues and it takes less time

572
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,600
 so that's good. It's also a social deduction game where if you are sitting thinking aha I am

573
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,840
 terrible at social deduction games because I am a bad liar and I do not like playing games where

574
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,880
 that is a problem for me. It's a game where you can immediately announce you are a hybrid and just

575
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,320
 be very obvious about your sabotages or you can be very subtle and sneaky and do it that way. So

576
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,560
 it's a game that kind of rewards both playstyles which I think is good and I really really enjoyed

577
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,640
 it which is good because I'd already bought a copy but it's nice to know that I won't have to

578
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:23,000
 sell the copy I bought. Hoorah! The and I will also say the ludicrous in Croydon is possibly the best

579
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,160
 board game cafe in the UK it is very good I would highly recommend if you live anywhere near it

580
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:35,960
 going to it is lovely. That feels like I should have an entire weekend where we go and stay with

581
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,240
 friends in Croydon and spend one day at the ludicrous playing board games and one day at Flip Out

582
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:46,360
 Pinball. Would you take those friends and go and play Alkam Horror with them? Well Alison.

583
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:53,960
 I mean I might need ropes my entire and then it might actually become kidnap rather than escorting.

584
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:02,920
 I will do a quick pick. I am continuing to work through the Hugo finalists because having thought

585
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,960
 oh the Hugo's late this year I have plenty of time I in fact have three weeks. Who could have

586
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,000
 thought that would happen? I know who could have who could have considered this so I read one of

587
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,480
 the best novella nominees The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nivo. I will know actually all the best

588
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:25,560
 novella finalists are from Tor.com this year they have really been putting out a lot of good novellas

589
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:32,600
 and this is it's a nice fancy novella it's basically a cleric who is going around trying to collect

590
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:39,320
 the history of the Empress's life or Aspect's Empress's life after this Empress has died

591
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:46,200
 and so she goes to the house in which the Empress is once exiled and here's the story of the Empress

592
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:53,880
 from Rabbit who is an early woman who turns out to have been the Empress's servant and they kind of

593
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,000
 go around cataloging the contents of this palace and while they're cataloging it you kind of get

594
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 all the different aspects of the Empress's life you know she basically has a diplomatic

595
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:11,400
 marriage to an emperor who banished it after he has an heir and you know she basically

596
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:18,920
 secretly plans her revenge from exile with the help of her friends and servants and it sort of

597
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,400
 you know tells that whole story and ended up being you know they're after the coronation of the new

598
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:31,240
 Empress and it's just a nice setting I like the conceit of having like the cleric who is collecting

599
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:37,400
 these stories and kind of what is what is Rabbit telling the narrator and what is she not telling

600
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:44,680
 her the idea that you know Rabbit is essentially goes overlooked because she is a peasant girl who

601
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:50,680
 is a servant when actually she's one of the keys to the whole thing and I think it works really well

602
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,280
 at novella length as well it gives you enough to kind of flesh out the characters but it didn't

603
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:00,680
 need to be a really long story so I I very much liked it so I'm gonna read the rest of tour.com

604
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,760
 best novella finalists now and see which one is best I've read the Empress of Salt of Fortune

605
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:13,960
 I really liked it it is one of my two favorite novellas on the roster Liz so you may you may

606
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,520
 disagree with you may think other ones are better than than I did but I thought the Empress of Salt

607
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,600
 of Fortune was probably either the best or the second best I think it largely depends how much

608
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:29,880
 you like Finnr which is a brilliant story set in an Ikea I loved that story but I know that it didn't

609
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,160
 land for everyone if I tell you I've read three so far and Finnr is at the bottom of the pile

610
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:42,120
 basically is said the the conceit is that there are parallel universes and the membrane

611
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:47,320
 between the universes gets more porous when those universes are like closer to each other and Ikea's

612
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,240
 they are especially porous because every little zone of an Ikea is basically its own parallel

613
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,280
 universe anyway and so basically you can go to like interdimensional Ikea's and they do and it's

614
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,760
 brilliant yeah I thought the conceit of Finnr was great and then the actual novella was like

615
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:07,960
 just kind of a let down because it couldn't live up to conceit so do you guys know about the

616
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:15,400
 people who filmed a series of YouTube stories in Ikea's around the world well really they're local

617
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:22,600
 of Kea's amazing I did not know that and it gets very meta because it gets the point where every

618
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,920
 Ikea in North America has the photos of these people taped up in the staff room saying if they

619
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,960
 come on site because I mean Ikea's a great place to film your home video right because they've

620
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:40,840
 got all the sets that was the Octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

621
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:46,280
 and it's goodbye from me

622
00:58:46,280 --> 00:59:02,280
 [Music]

623
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:09,560
 I don't know is there a kind of clean term for a giant large amount of something like metric

624
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:16,120
 fuck ton but podcast appropriate you could just say a metric ton I guess it's not very much fun but

625
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,200
 I mean I would say like a shitload and I guess it can't say on the podcast either

626
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:27,080
 it's four in the funk and morning and your funk and hip hop is keeping me awake a metric

627
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:34,360
 frack ton of power points and internet which made me very happy like that will that do yeah

628
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:40,280
 fine I'd have kept the fuck ton in can I have one fuck the theme music for this episode was
