1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 Yes, because we segued to that some time ago.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 22nd episode of OctaThought, a podcast to science fiction and science fiction fandom.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,200
 I'm John Coxon.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,600
 I'm Alison Scott.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,000
 And I'm Liz Batty.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,300
 Happy New Year.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,300
 Yes.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,300
 Happy New Year.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:34,700
 We're into the second year of OctaThought, well not quite the second year if you count 12 months, but the second year counter-chronologically.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,200
 Yeah, anyone who is not using an OctaThought-centric calendar is clearly a Ronan.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,200
 I mean, that would be true if we only recorded two episodes, so...

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,700
 That would be true if we'd only done two episodes.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,500
 Yeah, I mean, if we'd still... it's either podcast in like November, then it would also be true that we'd be into the second year of OctaThought,

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,000
 but I don't think it would be a particularly great achievement.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,700
 Okay, so I feel like OctaThought was one of our reactions to what 2020 was.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:10,400
 And so here we are in 2021, which means we have survived 2020 and 2021 will definitely be a different sort of year.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,300
 It's true.

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:18,400
 We have survived 2020 and I think it is definitely true that while I know John had been talking about podcast for a while,

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,500
 it took actually being stuck in his house for us to actually sit down and do it.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,700
 Is that fair, John?

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,800
 I think so.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:34,800
 It is difficult to argue with the facts, which doesn't necessarily always stop the three of us, but yeah.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:44,700
 OctaThought really helped me in 2020 and apparently also, Klebrile from Croydon, who was written to tell us so...

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,400
 Oh yeah, that's a great segue.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,600
 And I have really cemented it by noting that it was a segue, so that's good.

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
 Claire says that she liked episode 21.

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,500
 Claire made an excellent joke in her letter of comment, which was...

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,400
 When we were discussing what could be nominated for best games or interactive experience, you go.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,900
 Claire has then thought about what could be in a future best interactive experience, you go.

30
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,900
 And then moved on to make a very good joke about what could be the best inactive and experienced, you go.

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:21,300
 And owing to the problem several weeks ago, where I read out the first draft of Claire's letter and did not correct her typo,

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,400
 I then emailed her to say, "Oh, is this a typo?"

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
 And she was like, "No, it is a clever joke."

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,300
 So I'm very sorry, Claire, for doubting that your clever joke was a clever joke and check if you made a typo.

35
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,900
 But it's because I'm now paranoid about reading out the wrong versions of your letters.

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,600
 So I don't know. Maybe you should put a deliberate mistake in your letter so I can transport it next time.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,600
 And in that sense, Claire's locks will become an interactive experience.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,900
 Oh, Roman Ozansky wrote us a letter of comment, kind of about our discussion about interactive games.

39
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,900
 One of the things he said was, it wasn't until the podcast ended that I realized that the long game was Claire's brilliant gameplay

40
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,100
 in that by interacting with the Octa though creators, she has altered the tone and content of the podcast.

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,500
 And surely this then counts as an interactive game.

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,700
 And so, yes, Oxford thought, vote Oxford thought for best interactive experience.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,900
 If you would like to vote for Octa thought for best interactive experience, turn to page 34.

44
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,800
 If you would like to vote for Octa thought for best podcast, turn to 41.

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 If you would like to vote for people not self-upercising for the Hugos, please turn to 2001.

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 If you would like to vote for Octa thought for best fanzine, please turn to 2005.

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,900
 Are we eligible at best fanzine?

48
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,100
 No, we would have been in 2005, though.

49
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,800
 Hence, the joke.

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,400
 Oh, I was really sorry.

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
 Was that a joke?

52
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,300
 I thought it was a typo.

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
 It was a joke.

54
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,800
 No, was it?

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,500
 Was it 2006 that best fan cast came in?

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,800
 Yeah, I think that's right.

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,200
 Yeah.

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:06,300
 Please nominate us for several of the non-existent Hugo categories that Alison invented in the previous second of the podcast because it would be quite funny.

59
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,400
 Exactly.

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,600
 And then Dave Mansfield is going to nominate the spacebar from punctuation for the Hugo because the Ludo narrative was much better

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,000
 than the rehearsed plots that have been played out beforehand.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,700
 So thank you, Dave.

63
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,900
 I am enjoying the number of things that the Hugo movie straight is going to be like, what?

64
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,500
 What is that?

65
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,100
 And why has it been nominated just from like two people in the UK?

66
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,200
 I'm looking forward to it.

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,200
 And if Claire and Mark are helping with the Hugo's again this year, I'm really sorry, Claire and Mark.

68
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,400
 On the subject of Mark, Mark sent me an email, not the podcast.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,900
 We're going to take the liberty of mentioning something he wrote.

70
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,400
 So Alison referred to Outworld 71 in the last episode of Octthorpe.

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,300
 It is a fanzine.

72
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,200
 You can buy it off Amazon for the Princely some of 15 currency units.

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,900
 I will put a link in the show notes for anyone who would like to discover more about Alison's mysterious references from episode 21.

74
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,100
 Thank you for letting me know, Mark.

75
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,300
 Can I actually buy 15 currency units or is that only certain currency units?

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,900
 It is definitely a currency unit.

77
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,300
 I forget whether it's pounds or dollars, which is why I suspect it's 14.

78
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
 $0.99.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,300
 Okay.

80
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:24,900
 Andrew Hogg has also asked about the disc on Hugo and he asked on a discord how it will cope with early access games and such like.

81
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:34,700
 So for those who aren't familiar, video games sometimes come out in an early access form where they're not finished, but you can buy them, which is a delightful mechanism of commerce, which I love.

82
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:52,000
 Well, and so those who aren't familiar. So for instance, the kind of the best example I can conjure is that Minecraft when it became really big in about 2010, 2011, Minecraft was in early access and it was only officially released quite a few years after it had become a worldwide phenomenon.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,300
 And so the question is like, would Minecraft be eligible again when it hit 1.0?

84
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,700
 Would it be eligible again when it hit beta?

85
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,000
 Would it have been eligible in alphurks?

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
 It wasn't properly out yet.

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:13,000
 And that is actually a good question and one I intended to bring up last week, but we had been talking about the Hugo category for about 50 minutes solidly at that point.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,900
 And I thought perhaps having more was not desirable.

89
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:27,100
 And I love the fact that Mark and Claire having volunteered to help with the hugos at having zero interested video games will get to make judgments of this sort of fine detail.

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:40,800
 I was going to say that as brought up by Listen Joe on a Discord elsewhere, probably the real issue here might be Stardew Valley because that had a big patch this year, which introduced a whole bunch of new content.

91
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,500
 And it is also a game which is, which can plausibly be nominated for the best video game Hugo this year.

92
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:56,000
 So this you will be does having a big patch with new content qualify it to be kind of nominated as a 2020 game.

93
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,700
 So we're going to enter all kinds of discussions of how much new content was there because it's not done as a standalone.

94
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,300
 It's not a standalone expansion or anything.

95
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,100
 It's a, oh, we have dropped the new content and there is a different farm and some lots more content.

96
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,000
 So no, it's interesting.

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,800
 I think this is the thing I'm the least convinced about by this, this Hugo category.

98
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,800
 There is no proposal to have a hard and fast set of rules about this, which is probably in some ways very sensible because doing a high.

99
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,100
 Hard and fast set of rules about this seems like it would be incredibly difficult because it's so woolly, but equally I do want the extent to which different

100
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:45,800
 administrators are going to have different takes and the extent to which the fandom is going to be one of the other things Claire mentions is a Hugo voters known for their restraint or their ability to not nominate things for the memes.

101
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,200
 Perhaps perhaps she has a point.

102
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
 So we'll see.

103
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,000
 We'll see how it goes.

104
00:07:50,700 --> 00:08:00,900
 It may be that it takes a couple of years for the best interactive experience to get into stride and for people to get a sense of what should and should not be nominated.

105
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:19,200
 I also have a tiny bit of follow up on best video game, which is that a podcast which I listened to, but which is not on the subject of video games had a set of awards for the year, which quite light hearted, which included best video game and

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 44% of the nominators nominated animal crossing New Horizons.

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:35,600
 So I think that's the extent to which, as I suggested last time, that this category is going to be dominated by that game in this year, not necessarily in every year.

108
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,000
 I'm looking for the Upgrades website and I can't find it.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,800
 It'll be an upgrade somewhere.

110
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,200
 I mean, you could you could link to the upgrade is, but I don't think it's terribly relevant.

111
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:55,000
 The reason I was looking for the upgrade is was because the other thing that was really interesting, which comes down to something I mentioned last episode was that the runner up for the game of the year was among us, which is not a game that was released last year.

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,400
 Because it is very popular and it became very popular last year.

113
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:08,000
 And so I think that's the other thing we did highlight, which is among us is going to get votes and they're going to have to decide whether or not it counts.

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And I think that is actually a hard choice.

115
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:19,600
 And so I do, I do wonder the extent to which we need to start having conversations about, you know, these are games which are clearly going to get nominated.

116
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:31,600
 And we probably ought to have a discussion about whether or not they're eligible in advance of, you know, the Hugo administrators who may not be particularly plugged into the video game scene, making those decisions on Vanden's behalf.

117
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,300
 No, but I think they are plugged into the podcast that talk about the video game scene like ours.

118
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,000
 Oh, yes, I mean, obviously all of the Hugo administrators will be keenly listening to what we say about this.

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,800
 And I will, I will put a link to the upgrade is in the show notes.

120
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,500
 Maggie sent us a letter of comment.

121
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,800
 I don't know to either of you know, she's just signed it Maggie of Glasgow.

122
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:07,600
 So Maggie of Glasgow sent us a letter again discussing our discussion of the special Hugo category for video games and discussing also the fact that as well as triple A game,

123
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,900
 being quite expensive, they also, some of them require quite a large time commitment.

124
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,400
 Do I think we discussed a little bit and some AA games are incredibly long and some are quite a lot shorter.

125
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,800
 Maggie says they have been playing the Witcher 3 for about two years now on and off and are still only halfway through.

126
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,700
 So I guess the issue there is, yeah, how many of the likely nominees are games that take an awful long time to finish?

127
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,000
 And also if the AA game has taken over a long time to finish, how quickly do you know whether you would feel happy nominating or voting for them?

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,800
 Because if it's a game that I'm willing to think about 150 hours into a playthrough of, then I probably know after the first like 20, whether I'm thinking this is a good game I'm going to nominate.

129
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,300
 And the answer is probably yes, because I'm willing to put 150 hours into it.

130
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,200
 Yeah, I think, I think that's fair.

131
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,800
 I think if you're reading like the people who read the people who nominated, for example, like the S.F.

132
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,400
 Encyclopedia for best related work.

133
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,900
 I suspect they hadn't read the whole thing, but they had read enough of it to know that they thought it was worth nominating for you.

134
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,600
 And I think the same thing will apply with longer games.

135
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,500
 Like if you have any blast, like it's fine just playing her eyes as a redone.

136
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:21,700
 And I think I speak for her where I'd say if it was eligible, she would nominate it and she hasn't seen the ending yet, but she has been playing for like over 100 hours at this point.

137
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:29,100
 So I think that would probably indicate that she's enjoying it enough to nominate it.

138
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,500
 Lots of games don't have endings and lots of games.

139
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
 Nobody ever sees the ending because there's so much content.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,500
 If it has an ending, that ending should be moderately satisfying, but they're off a lot.

141
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 They're off a just this is the point where the content finished.

142
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,200
 Well, that shouldn't that doesn't necessarily matter for games.

143
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,300
 Yeah, I would also say there are games with fairly unsatisfying endings.

144
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:02,800
 And I'm thinking of Mass Effect 3 in particular where there was a massive campaign to get from people who wanted their money back because the ending was so unsatisfactory.

145
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,400
 And actually, I agree that the ending is not great, but it's still a pretty great game anyway.

146
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,800
 And the ending doesn't actually ruin that.

147
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,500
 So yeah, the ending is maybe not the destination as much as if I'm reading a novel.

148
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,000
 The ending is just a point along the way where I then go back and finish all the side quests.

149
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,100
 Yeah, and I think that gets a little bit until I will be talking last time about like new,

150
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,500
 Lou Donerative and stuff like that.

151
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,400
 But thank you for very thought provoking email Maggie.

152
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,300
 And thank you for everyone who wrote in.

153
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,900
 It was a bumper roster this week.

154
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:44,800
 Okay, so the attentive listener may have noticed that it is 2021 now and therefore that means that 2020 is over.

155
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
 So we're going to talk about 2020 as it was.

156
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:55,600
 So 2020, let me review the fan act that happened worldwide lots in the UK, mostly Alison.

157
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
 Alison, do you want to talk about that?

158
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,900
 Is that a helpful way of framing it?

159
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100
 I'm not sure if it is helpful.

160
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:10,600
 It's not just me, but I think one of the things to have to Christmas is that I had a party, which I might talk about a little bit separately.

161
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:18,500
 But lots of other people in fandom also had parties, but also lots of other people who are not so connected with fandom.

162
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:37,900
 Had parties and I started to notice that the things that science fiction fandom has been doing for the last nine months to have fun online have not really percolated through the wider community and a lot of things that when people are saying, oh, 2020 has been appalling.

163
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:47,100
 It's because they're not doing the things that have made it less appalling for me and for I think a lot of other science fiction fans.

164
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:55,500
 But I made more new friends in 2020 that I have done in any year, I think, since I left university.

165
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,400
 And that's that's kind of not what you would expect really.

166
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,900
 Here it is.

167
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,000
 It's a pandemic and I'm stuck in my house.

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,400
 What am I going to do?

169
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
 I'm going to make friends with a lot of new people.

170
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,800
 I know that you feel uncomfortable about.

171
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:20,200
 I think I think you are reticent stake all the credit, which I think is to your credit because obviously it was not just you and I am being slightly facetious.

172
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
 But I will say that you have done a lot more.

173
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:30,600
 You have been a driving force in British fandom this year to an extent that I think you are slightly unaware of.

174
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,300
 I think without you, my 2020 would have been a lot less fulfilling.

175
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,600
 So thank you, Alison is what I'm saying for making my 2020 much better.

176
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:57,200
 Yeah, OK, so that is kind, but I was doing this because I'm not working in a hospital or volunteering in a food bank or changing the world by doing making big political change or that sort of thing.

177
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,200
 You know, I kind of was stuck in the house trying not to get sick.

178
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,700
 So it's kind of, well, what can you do if you're stuck in the house trying not to get sick that will be moderately helpful.

179
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,200
 And it turned out that for me, the answer was run parties on zoom.

180
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
 Yeah.

181
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
 So I don't know.

182
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
 Yeah, I've run some parties on zoom.

183
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,200
 So it as it happens every year, it got to the end of the year and people started saying it's 2021.

184
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
 Where am I jetpacks?

185
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:38,200
 And for those of you, I don't think we talked about this in, we might have mentioned it in the last Doctor of Thought, but quite a lot of you will have been at.

186
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:56,200
 And many of you will have heard of a party that I helped run over New Year's Eve, where we had, I think, almost 300 individual actual people from all over the world, partying on zoom for 24 hours.

187
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 We had a few program items that just kind of slipped in there, just in case 24 hours of just hanging out on zoom was too much for you.

188
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:21,200
 And we celebrated, we had Laurie Mann finding firework displays from every time zone to display at the top of the hour and other bits of the hour, because actually not all time zones happen at the top of the hour, as you'll know if you paid attention to guff.

189
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:28,200
 And yeah, so we, so, so, so, I feel like this is one of the most science fictional things I've done in my whole life.

190
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:37,200
 This is one of these things where, if you've said to me when I was 10, oh, people from all over the world will be able to get together for a drink.

191
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,200
 In, when you're 55, I would have gone, oh, that's pretty cool, listen to it.

192
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:54,200
 And yes, we don't actually have teleport devices or anything, but, but seeing as we were kind of the sort of people who were mostly living in our heads anyway, it's not such a big problem.

193
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:01,200
 If we, if science fictional fans were more visceral people, it might not have been as much fun.

194
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:11,200
 I think I've done some things in 2020, like I did anoraptories, a TAFTRIP report interviews, which were a good thing to kind of get Vanish people together and kind of have a chinwag.

195
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 I edited a few van zines, I did a journey plan, a couple of shows with Lolsene, which was, which was cool.

196
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 And obviously I've done this podcast, which I think has done something to kind of foster communication in British science fiction fandom.

197
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 And I flat myself that I think all three of us contribute a lot, but I think probably I am the driving force behind this, like probably 40% me, 30% both of you.

198
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,200
 It's like that adds up to 100, right?

199
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
 Yeah.

200
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:47,200
 I mean, I think John Zessner, 40% John, 30% the turbos for the podcast is extremely generous because, oh, it is mostly John.

201
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
 Sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

202
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,200
 John's done a ton of stuff this year, actually, yeah, because he is absolutely the driving force behind this podcast.

203
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
 It would not happen if it were down to me.

204
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:05,200
 And I don't think it would happen if it were down to Liz, but it definitely wouldn't happen if it were down to me on a couch of how all of the editing and making it happen stuff.

205
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 Oh, yeah, I just turn up Waffle for 90 minutes, try and stop you guys going wildly on to off topic and failing, discussing the orbit of the sun.

206
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
 And then if I'm very good, I remember to send the file to John.

207
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,200
 I think I'm just saying that I, if it was down to me, this podcast would not happen because I have no concept of how to do audio editing.

208
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:39,200
 Now, I think, you know, Alison obviously became basically the party maven of the entire UK fandom, and I popped into many of her Zoom meetings and her new year party, which was very entertaining.

209
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,200
 John made multiple TAF reports happen, I think, and wrote bunch of fanzines.

210
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,200
 And I didn't do very much because 2020 was a less weird year for me.

211
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,200
 And because, yeah, let me think of that phrases.

212
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,200
 I've put in the show notes Liz had a 20, chill 2020 owing to having a toned toes done and swimming and whatnot.

213
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,200
 I did do a bunch of swimming and I did have my toes done a few times, that is true.

214
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 But yeah, it's partly that I had a more chill 2020 than many people did, which I'm very grateful.

215
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,200
 I also had a very busy 2020 work-wise.

216
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:25,200
 And also, I do feel a bit of a distance because of how the Earth orbits the sun and we have time zones.

217
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,200
 It does feel a bit isn't basically you have to plan a lot more.

218
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:38,200
 Like if you want to chat to people, you have to put a bit more thought and planning into it because you have to have to have that happen during the eight hours of the day when you're both awake.

219
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,200
 So I think it's a bit easier if you don't have those problems.

220
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,200
 So really in terms of fanak, I already did not do a lot.

221
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
 So maybe 2021 will be the year in which I do more fanak.

222
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 But let's not go too far.

223
00:19:51,200 --> 00:20:01,200
 I think obviously I know that you are in Toyland as we may have covered on this show previously.

224
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
 Many times, yes.

225
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:17,200
 And like Alison and I are, and we try not to get deeply into politics on this show, but Alison and I are in a country where it is possible that the government have not had the best ideas about how to deal with COVID as COVID has unwrapped around them.

226
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
 I think that is probably a thing I can say out loud.

227
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:33,200
 You know, we're in a category along with the US and Brazil that are completely making the most complete meal of this, I think, that is possible to imagine.

228
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
 Anyway.

229
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:49,200
 But what I will say is that although I appreciate low, obviously, if most of your friends, if you are in a country where that is not true and most of your friends are in a country where that is true, it must be a bit surreal to be like, well, you know, Thailand's cooked with it quite well.

230
00:20:49,200 --> 00:21:04,200
 And I'm not too impacted, but I think I don't, although me and Alison regularly listeners take the piss out of Liz for how Liz is allowed to go outside and have fun and we have to stay in our houses and just be, you know, sad.

231
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:16,200
 I think in general, you know, I'm glad that you are in a place which is less completely up a creek than the UK is at the moment.

232
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
 And I am happy about that.

233
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:37,200
 Yeah, I am happy for all my friends that are in places where, like, where everything is more or less OK. And, and I'm also, there's some people who've been going, well, 2020 was not at all about here for me and I feel guilty and embarrassed about that, because I've had, and I feel like we should,

234
00:21:37,200 --> 00:22:00,200
 there are plenty of people for whom 2020 has not been bad, including, I have to say, me, lots of good things happen to me in 2020, like making loads of new friends, like running a load of parties, like discovering that, that I was much better at being a party host if I don't have to tidy my house in order to run a party, which, you know, who knew.

235
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:16,200
 But Liz, you were saying you might do more fan act next year. Have you got any concrete plans or do you just feel a vague sense of guilt that me and Alison have been cooped up and so we've been lashing out creatively and you've been living a more normal life and have therefore, you know, been out living.

236
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:28,200
 Yeah, I basically just feel a vague sense of guilt until I have done what I usually do whenever I say I'll write a fancy article for someone which is say yeah yeah I'll definitely do that I feel bad for not having it, but then not do it.

237
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:45,200
 I mean, this is partly because what I quite enjoy doing is helping run conventions and I do enjoy helping run online conventions but not as much I enjoy helping run in person ones, especially when there was online conventions involved me either getting up very early or staying up very late.

238
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:55,200
 And I think the one thing we have all forgotten to mention in our fan act is that we did run a convention and Liz did run the convention.

239
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
 It did not. Yeah.

240
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
 So, see, I was on the.

241
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
 I actually have a set of notes.

242
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,200
 But I think I'm not, I'm not over egging the pudding where I think Liz probably put.

243
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,200
 Liz did more work with anybody else on punctuation. Let's be clear here. Liz did the program.

244
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:22,200
 Yeah, I think I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to offend Stephen, but I feel like he would, he would agree that Liz probably had the most to do in the con running.

245
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:31,200
 Yeah, don't you remember that Steve was gearing up at the point where we were really, really up against it for punctuation and he got a new job.

246
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
 Oh yeah, that's true.

247
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
 Congratulations on the job Steve.

248
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
 Yeah, which is going quite well, I think.

249
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
 So yeah.

250
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:53,200
 Hey, that's good. No, but no, Liz did, Liz did an awful lot of the punctuation prep for which, you know, we're very grateful because it was a, it was the bits that Liz did were very good, the bits that I did were fine, but the bits that Liz did were excellent.

251
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,200
 So, you know, hurrah Liz.

252
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
 Thank you. I think it all went well.

253
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:06,200
 It's very hard to tell actually who did, it's very hard to tell how much people have done, I think, but I guess we could go and look through all the little actions I ticked off into.

254
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
 I ticked off in Discord.

255
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:26,200
 In my journal, I had a load of outward focused and inward focused things that I did in 2020 and there were five outward focused things which were the Zoom coffee mornings and the parties, all the Zoom stuff, the first Thursday and the, the

256
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:45,200
 party, which incidentally I did with Karen Ward and Mike Schafer, who normally have a big in person party. So they just invited the whole of their list, who are calif, mostly Californians and, and West Coast, USians to the party to, and that kind of gave it a whole lots of different people who don't necessarily already know each other, which is good.

257
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,200
 Octothorpen punctuation, which I think we've spoken about a bit, and the guff trip.

258
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
 Oh yeah, you did a guff trip.

259
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,200
 Oh yeah, you did, you did do a guff trip.

260
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:06,200
 Which I only just mentioned sideways. I did an entire three week virtual guff trip at a writing about it.

261
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:17,200
 And then, and then the last thing I had down was that I've done a load of tissue paper art, which amused my neighbours and incidentally my friends on the internet.

262
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:30,200
 It did, it was, it was very good. Yes, I think you had not made the Octothorpe tissue paper art last time we published an episode, so you should send me a bit of it so I can put it in the chapter art.

263
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:45,200
 I did a number of inner growth things in 2020 as well, and the most notable of which was that about a month before everything kicked off, I, I decided to give up anger almost by accident.

264
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:55,200
 And although, obviously I've not always succeeded, I've given up anger in the way that somebody gives up smoking, but occasionally bumps cigarettes off people.

265
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,200
 So like that. So I occasionally bum anger off people.

266
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,200
 I don't know what to say, that is the logical conclusion. That, that is the episode title, bum anger off people. I don't know what it means.

267
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 Yeah, no, no, no, so I occasionally discover myself having a little bit of angry rage, but I'm much, much better at going that thing where you just stay angry or become very angry or do stupid things because you're in a rage.

268
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,200
 I'm not doing it like any more, I'm done with that.

269
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:39,200
 In 2021, one of my things I'm going to do, one of my three New Year's resolutions, what I posted on Facebook was to release an issue of Lolsim every month.

270
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
 Yay!

271
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 So Lolsim is the comedy focused science fiction podcast I do with my wife, it's by Nisha.

272
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,200
 Sure.

273
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,200
 Yes, sorry, let me start again. Lolsim is the comedy science fiction fan scene that I do with my wife, it's by Nisha.

274
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,200
 We did four episodes on our website, Lolsim.net, and then we decided that issues.

275
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,200
 [Lolsim laughs]

276
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,200
 Sorry, cut in red flow there.

277
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,200
 No, no, it's entirely my fault. That was a sigh of disappointment at myself.

278
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
 [Lolsim laughs]

279
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
 This has to stay in, this has to stay in.

280
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,200
 It's Fanny and I did four issues of our "franzing" on Lolsim.net.

281
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:38,200
 Before we decided that doing a fan scene on a website is really quite a lot of effort and doesn't really encapsulate most of the things we enjoy about writing fanzines.

282
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:44,200
 We've transitioned to a tiny letter, a newsletter.

283
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,200
 A tiny letter is a product that has been bought by MailChimp, which lets you do small, simple email newsletters for up to, I think, a thousand people.

284
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
 I don't think we're going to get to a thousand people.

285
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
 We are doing Lolsim on there.

286
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,200
 We're reprinting the articles that we did on the website, and we're printing new articles, and we're putting some art in each issue.

287
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,200
 If you'd like to sign up, there will be a link in the show notes.

288
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
 It comes out once a month.

289
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:16,200
 It turns out it's much more fun doing an email fanzine than a website fanzine while getting away from.

290
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:30,200
 I really don't like PDFs as a way of reading things, and I think it was great when people were beginning to go online with their fanzines, but I think a lot of fanzines just thought, "Oh, we could put PDFs on the internet and that will be fine."

291
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:37,200
 BananaWink does an e-pub, which is much better, because you can read it on a phone and it's not like in tiny writing, and I think e-pubs are great.

292
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
 I did that when I was publishing Procrastinations way back when.

293
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:50,200
 And Alison did a fanzine or a perzine, I suppose, on an email mailing list, which ran for us.

294
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,200
 Yes, it's tiny letter. I thought you were also tiny letter?

295
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
 Yes, we are.

296
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:06,200
 I was just listening to you talking about Lolsine, and I'm like, "I don't have New Year's resolutions, but I'm actually going to do some more of those since I monthly sounds good."

297
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:24,200
 They were really good, and I think they really neatly encapsulated the feel of a fanzine going to a small group of people, and the feel of the issue by issue nature of fanzine without replicating the kind of annoying technical limitations of paper fanzines or PDF fanzines.

298
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:32,200
 And so I kind of feel like it would be cool if a lot more fanzines embraced email as a potential medium.

299
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,200
 And I'm surprised that more haven't, but, you know...

300
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,200
 There's a problem with the... This is probably a bit abstruse.

301
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,200
 There's a problem with my fanzines as it was constructed in that it was very remit.

302
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,200
 It was very requiring of external links.

303
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,200
 It had a lot of links in it, and you were expected to go and look at them when they interested you.

304
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:01,200
 And this is fine in terms of a thing that is current, but links break at a massive rate.

305
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:11,200
 So for archiving purposes, I was very keen to have a sort of secondary document that, for me, that said all of the...

306
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,200
 That explained what all of those links were and meant, and that's tedious.

307
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:28,200
 So it kind of ended up in a... It basically disappeared up its own ass, and I need to find a way to do it that does not involve it disappearing up its own ass.

308
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,200
 But I do have a third issue, nearly done or something, so, you know, I could do that.

309
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:44,200
 That sounds like a... I'm not... I don't do resolutions. I'm having a yearly theme in the way that my lovely, lovely tech bloggers like, and tech podcasters.

310
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,200
 They're not bloggers, they're podcasters. Sorry. My yearly theme is automation.

311
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:57,200
 I don't really have any gold for the year. Don't have any fan-ish plants for the year.

312
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,200
 I'm not really a sort of like resolutions and gold for the year kind of person.

313
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
 So...

314
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 Maybe. Let's see.

315
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:14,200
 Let's see how 2021 goes. 2021, I am not looking forward to the first three months of 2021, but at the end of the first three months of 2021, we have an Eastercon!

316
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
 Yay!

317
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,200
 Easter time! Looking forward to Eastercon. How's that for a segue then, Sean?

318
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,200
 I mean, great segue. I think all the segue is a great...

319
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,200
 The segue is a bet if we don't keep saying, "Isn't that a great segue every time we do a great one?"

320
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
 Which is just going to call attention to every time we do a crap segue.

321
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,200
 Which is quite often.

322
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:46,200
 OK, so, Eastercon. For those who were paying attention when we started our podcast, Eastercon is a national convention run in the United Kingdom every year, usually at Easter.

323
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:55,200
 And there was a bid session at Easter last year, which elected the 2021 Eastercon, which is called Confusion.

324
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:07,200
 And at the time, Confusion did not have planned to go online, but then COVID continued to happen over the course of 2020, and now Eastercon have launched their Discord this week.

325
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,200
 So who put the Discord together?

326
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:24,200
 So I had, prior to punctuation, I volunteered to put together an Eastercon Discord, and I kind of wanted to go in one direction, and the committee, entirely reasonably, the committee, slightly, slightly,

327
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,200
 disagree with me about where is she go. So I said, "Well, for enough, I've set it up."

328
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,200
 But then I will let you enlist it, and I will step down and do punctuation.

329
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,200
 And I think they kind of continue to tinker with it, and continue to make it what they wanted it to be, and now it is up.

330
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,200
 And you can go and join, and we will put a link to it in the show notes.

331
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
 But yes, and...

332
00:32:47,200 --> 00:33:01,200
 I don't think it's quite as clear as it may be ought to be, but it currently has quite a small area that is accessible to everyone, and then a rather larger area that is accessible to the members of Confusion.

333
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:10,200
 And I think the other thing we should definitely make sure we haven't shown it is how you could go and buy your virtual membership of Confusion.

334
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:31,200
 If you haven't done already, as soon as they had out virtual memberships, I joined, because obviously I want to be a member of the EastCon, but also because I had not previously joined, because I've been very sure for quite a long time that I was not going to want to go to a physical convention at Easter.

335
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,200
 Yeah, so...

336
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,200
 I joined as soon as they announced...

337
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:54,200
 So I can't remember when this happened, but there was a point at which they did the refunds from the 2020 EastCon, and they opened membership sales for 2021, and I got my refund from the 2020 EastCon, and I immediately spent it on joining 2021.

338
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:10,200
 And the cost of an adult attending membership is £70, and the cost of an adult online membership is £50. Online membership rates were announced in October, and the plan is for the EastCon to either be hybrid or virtual.

339
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:34,200
 There are reports from people such as John Bray that their rooms for the convention have been refunded, because the hotel has told them that they won't be open, so it looks rather like clearly the EastCon will be virtual, but as far as we understand, the hotel has not yet informed EastCon that it will not be open, and so there might be some more wrangling to do there.

340
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:48,200
 This is all coming from Facebook comments and our reception of Scuttlebutt, so please do listen and take all of this with the requisite large pinch of salt.

341
00:34:48,200 --> 00:35:07,200
 I had a memory of EastCon having announced that it was going to go hybrid or possibly virtual. Yes, but in that announcement, which I went back and read the other day, it said we are planning for a virtual or possibly hybrid convention.

342
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:18,200
 So, I am slightly wondering if they have edited that or if it is my memory that is at fault, but they had a lot of talking about the exciting things they were thinking of doing with hybridization.

343
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,200
 I think it always said hybrid or virtual.

344
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,200
 It definitely says virtual or possibly hybrid, and they are saying we have always planned for a virtual convention.

345
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,200
 Liz, have you bought an EastCon adult online membership?

346
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,200
 I have not done so yet.

347
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
 Do you think you might?

348
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,200
 I probably will. I just sort of want to know a bit more about what they are planning.

349
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:53,200
 They have asked for volunteers, including volunteers for program items, and they are asking us to tell us what we would like.

350
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:08,200
 I think the root of the problem is that I had a membership for 2020, which I was thinking about selling in February when it was clear that I was not actually going to make it to EastCon.

351
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,200
 And then clearly I should have flogged it slightly, then I did.

352
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,200
 Because obviously then the convention was cancelled due to COVID.

353
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:25,200
 And I decided not to get a refund because I felt I was happy for it to go towards the costs of future EastCons.

354
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:42,200
 And in times I didn't ask for a refund, partly because they didn't read the email they sent me in enough detail to note that they said they didn't need the money to cover their costs, because I was thinking they probably had some costs that still had to be paid due to the last minute cancellation.

355
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:49,200
 And I thought that would help them with that. I probably should have read it because it said they didn't really need it, and it was going to sort of future EastCon pass-alongs.

356
00:36:49,200 --> 00:37:02,200
 But I think it has sort of tainted my view of buying a membership for the latest one, because I'm like, well, last time I bought a membership and then I couldn't go and I just didn't do anything about it and I didn't get a refund.

357
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:16,200
 And so I essentially gifted a bunch of money to future EastCons, which is fine, but it means I'm now in the kind of like, oh, if you want my 50 quid, what am I actually getting for that 50 quid and can I have a little bit more detail on it?

358
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:27,200
 Because if they have some great plans, then that's fine, but if what they plan to run is a sort of, you know, Zoom Discord, Streamyard-based convention.

359
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,200
 Well, I've got some experience now of doing that, and I know it really doesn't cost a lot of money.

360
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:43,200
 And I'm sure you need more Zoom licenses and bigger Zoom licenses and probably some more tech, but if we can do it for what was basically about two pounds a person,

361
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,200
 then I would like to know kind of what is in the planning that will cost 50 pounds a person.

362
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,200
 Yeah, I mean, I've said I know how to spend 50 pounds a person on a virtual event.

363
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,200
 I'm just not sure it quite represents good value for money for people yet.

364
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:11,200
 I also need to know that what they're planning for that 50 quid will work for me, because if what they mean is they're going to have lots of excellent evening program item extravaganza, which you could spend quite a lot of money on that.

365
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:19,200
 That's nice, but I'd have to, you know, upend my own personal time zone in order to watch those, which I might not be willing to do.

366
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,200
 And I think it also ties into my feeling a bit like the finances of EasterCon.

367
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:33,200
 I don't really have any feeling right now about how much money there sort of is in a general EasterCon pass along slash crisis fund,

368
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:44,200
 how much we've been putting into that, how much has been used by past EasterCons, and whether we're just, are we just sort of setting a price because it's similar to what past EasterCons have done,

369
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:53,200
 but we're now at the point where, say, if we're up to a regular thousand person convention, we could make it a little bit cheaper or offer more targeted discounts, all things like that.

370
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,200
 So what I think I'm saying is, yeah, I'm probably going to join EasterCon. I'm just being excited, I'm going to be about it.

371
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:09,200
 I think Boscone has got a page on its website, which we will put a link in the show notes to, which says, why is Boscone costing $25?

372
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
 Why is Boscone not free?

373
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:21,200
 And they, I think, are very clear about what it is that you get for your $25 and why you might want to spend $25 rather than having the convention be free,

374
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:36,200
 and I think it is a very good note, and I would like, and in fact, I asked EasterCon way back, maybe September, this September or October, to do this roughly for EasterCon, and I have not really seen them say,

375
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:47,200
 because £50 is a lot more than $25 for one thing, and I think it's a lot easier to see what a convention might cost $25 than it is to see why it might cost £50,

376
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:59,200
 and I have not yet had any reply to that, but as it was a Facebook comment, there's a sense in which I don't necessarily deserve a reply to it, so, you know, if you're involved in EasterCon and you're listening to this podcast then,

377
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:09,200
 I think I am speaking for a lot of people who quite like to know roughly, not only great detail, but roughly what their £50 is paying for.

378
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
 Is that fair?

379
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:19,200
 I think that is fair, I don't know what the best way to call on EasterCon to do that is.

380
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
 Facebook message, obviously.

381
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:39,200
 I would also like to see that, I mean, because I do understand that there may well be costs that mean that they are kind of covering the costs they have incurred running this convention for the £50 they are charging,

382
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:52,200
 in which case, absolutely fair enough, and they may be worried that some of those costs will be perceived by the fandom as kind of costs that should not be covered by their EasterCon membership,

383
00:40:52,200 --> 00:41:03,200
 so, for instance, if some of those costs are costs like we have incurred money that needs to be paid to the hotel, then maybe they're worried about saying, well, part of the reason we're charging this is because we need to pay off the hotel contract.

384
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,200
 I don't know, obviously that's all inside Facebook, and none of us know, but I do think that

385
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:20,200
 although I can see a way in which they might need to charge £50 for memberships, I think it is reasonable to say, right, but why are you charging that?

386
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:36,200
 Because ultimately they are asking fans to become members at this price point, and if they don't make the case that it's worth that much money, they might not get that much money, and, you know, and most fans might decide that it is fine and put down their £50, but

387
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:50,200
 I just think more transparency can't be a bad thing, and so, although I am sympathetic to these costs that they might need charge this much, and there might be things that I haven't thought of, you know, if that's the case, then tell me what they are, and then I'll be happy.

388
00:41:50,200 --> 00:42:02,200
 And I think it is probably a fair comment, but I don't know what the best way to kind of persuade them that that's the case is, and this is, I don't know, Alison, you'll know, and presumably as you will do too.

389
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,200
 Do Easticons tend to publish their finances after the fact, or not really?

390
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:31,200
 So, for Follicon, we asked Claire Breiley and Mark Plummer of Croydon to do our programme book, which they did extremely well, and as part of that, and not actually asked for by us, Claire, they went round and hung the treasurers of, I think, 11 previous Eastercons upside down by the ankles.

391
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:48,200
 Until their accounts fell out and published, and I just think this is a great credit to the treasures and to the conventions and to Claire and Mark, especially, and published a load of accounts that had not previously been published, which is good for two reasons.

392
00:42:48,200 --> 00:43:06,200
 The first is that it does tie up that accountability and show where the money went, and it's not a really great detail, you can't actually look and say, well, they paid that about this guest cost £6,000, this Gus cost £29p, or anything like that, it's very high level.

393
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:34,200
 The things that conventions, the headings that conventions choose to group accounts by are not always comparable, so some big expenditure chunks go into one heading rather than one account and a different heading and a different account, but they are very, very useful both to see what sorts of things we think are important and what sort of things money gets put into, but also the different choices that different Eastercons make,

394
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:48,200
 and they're also useful for budgeting purposes, because it means that if you're thinking about bidding for an Eastercon, you can actually look at the budget and have some sense of where the money is going to come from, where it is going to go, and what sorts of choices you have around that.

395
00:43:48,200 --> 00:44:11,200
 It was a wonderful piece of work by Clara Mark, it just reinforced for me the importance of doing that of every Eastercon, actually getting to the point where it can publish up counts, there are reasons why it sometimes gets delayed for a few years, but it's a bit like trip reports really, it's extremely welcome when they do turn up.

396
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:19,200
 So yes, Eastercons are in the practice, the reason, and the reason I'm kind of, and the Eastercons are not in the practice of publishing their budgets.

397
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:40,200
 So the reason why I'm, so when I'm asking confusion to do a little bit of publishing its budget, it's a way of saying I feel we're in, we've moved into a different phase of Eastercons existence, and so therefore, although it would not be normal for us to look at your budgets,

398
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:52,200
 we think it would be interesting and valuable for the community to have a conversation in the highest level terms, not in any sort of detail, about what your budget looks like.

399
00:44:52,200 --> 00:45:02,200
 I think actually I'm not even really asking for a budget, I think what I'm asking for is just a bit more detail, because I know what to expect from an in-person Eastercon,

400
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:15,200
 and I think by this time before an in-person Eastercon, you'd be starting to leak a few exciting program ideas and tell people a few of what the big things are going to be that are coming up at your convention,

401
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:23,200
 and I don't really have a feel kind of what this Eastercons committee are going for, because there are different flavors of online convention.

402
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:32,200
 So I just want them to tell us a bit more, I mean I suspect basically they're very busy, and obviously it is a terrible year in which to be planning an Eastercon.

403
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:40,200
 It has been a tricky year, and it's a tricky year to try and pivot to an entirely new mode of Eastercon going,

404
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,200
 and I'm really just grumpy and I will join eventually, I just want to know a bit more about what's going to happen.

405
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:55,200
 I think that's entirely reasonable, and I think I am hopeful that it will be good, but I am a little bit worried by the lack of detail,

406
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:03,200
 and maybe that is just because they're communicating badly, or maybe it's a sign of something worse, but if it's a sign they're communicating badly,

407
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,200
 then asking them to communicate more openly I think is a reasonable thing to do,

408
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:20,200
 and hopefully all of the many members of the Eastercon committee who devoutly listen to Octa thought will write in and tell us,

409
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,200
 or whatever, that would be good.

410
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:30,200
 They have an email address for volunteers, which we will put in our show notes, or we'll put a link to their volunteering page,

411
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:38,200
 and they're volunteering, as far as I can tell, if you are interested in being on the program or are interested in suggesting program ideas,

412
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:45,200
 then that is also the email to write to for, I'd like to be on the program, or I'd like to run this thing for your program,

413
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,200
 and I have basically written them an email to this address that essentially says,

414
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:59,200
 "I will do anything, please get in touch. I particularly want to help with running Zoom parties, because you know that's the thing I do,

415
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,200
 but obviously there's a load of other things you might want me to do, and I'd be very happy to help you,

416
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,200
 and I will let you know at the next Octa thought whether they have got back to me,

417
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,200
 but I would also suggest that my co-hosts might want to also do this,

418
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,200
 and not necessarily say they'll do anything, but to say they will do the things that they would like to do,

419
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,200
 or help with making the things they would like to see happen,

420
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,200
 and I would also suggest that all of our listeners fill in that thing if they're interested in Eastercon,

421
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,200
 as I suspect many, but not all of our listeners are.

422
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,200
 Yeah. I shall say, Anna Grump, who has actually not volunteered for Eastercon,

423
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
 so I should go and think about what I might want to do.

424
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,200
 That was the 22nd episode of the Octa thought podcast, and it's goodbye from me.

425
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,200
 It's goodbye from me, and it's goodbye from me.

426
00:47:46,200 --> 00:48:06,200
 [Music]

427
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:12,200
 It's happened again. It was daylight in Liz's house literally ten minutes ago, and now it's very not.

428
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,200
 No, no, because last time this was like a half an hour, I'd like...

429
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,200
 [Laughter]

430
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,200
 If only we knew, if only we knew how the sun worked Liz.

431
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,200
 It's dark. End of question.

432
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,200
 I spent two or three hours reading through this and discussing discussions of it,

433
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:38,200
 and at the end I believe that it is a combination of atmospheric phenomena,

434
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,200
 physical phenomena, and the way the brain works that causes it,

435
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,200
 and it's very interesting, and...

436
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:52,200
 I can't find one thing that it turns out to be more complicated than all that.

437
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:57,200
 Oh yeah, it's always... anything is always a mixture of things that happen to add up in the same way.

438
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
 It's like whether or not you put milk in your coffee,

439
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,200
 like how quickly does your coffee cool, and it says that there's like four different processes,

440
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,200
 but they all lean the same way to combine into a notable process.

441
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,200
 It turns out if you leave your coffee lying around for three quarters of the hour,

442
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,200
 because you're reading interesting articles about the way the sun goes down,

443
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,200
 your coffee is stone cold, no matter how you put your milk in.

444
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,200
 I will also say...

445
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,200
 And your coffee is cool slower if you rinse your mug out with boiling water before making coffee.

446
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,200
 That makes sense.

447
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,200
 I will also say, atmospheric processes are physical processes.

448
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,200
 Yeah, but okay, so there was a set of things about...

449
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,200
 No, I don't.

450
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,200
 The way in which the earth is moving, I know we had half an hour on this,

451
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,200
 you cut and tuck it out of the podcast.

452
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,200
 You meant atmospheric processes and orbital processes.

453
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,200
 I did, yeah.

454
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,200
 But, yes, anyway, right.

455
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,200
 I'm going to start podcasting from a cupboard so you can't see the sun.

456
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,200
 Why love is? So I love two things about that,

457
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,200
 which is firstly your dedication to preventing the ass and going off topic,

458
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,200
 and secondly your dedication to not closing the curtain that covers your window,

459
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
 because that would also work.

460
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,200
 But it was day like, I would have done that.

461
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,200
 If she'd like automated, the presses were curtain pulling, they were the curtains.

462
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
 Yes, but then we would notice.

463
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,200
 And we would get sidetracked by Liz Watt, um, fancy.

464
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,200
 [laughter]

465
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,200
 I'm so sorry, Liz.

466
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,200
 We're terrible co-hosts.

467
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
 Even with also with the curtain straw,

468
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
 you'd still know it was day like outside.

469
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,200
 It's quite sunny.

470
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,200
 That's fair enough.

471
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
 That's fair.

472
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,200
 Anyway, onto the letters of comment.
