1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 Liz: I do definitely need the water because I'm just gonna briefly send you a photo of the temperature sensor on the front of my fan.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,860
 John: *laughs*

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,480
 My cold open joke got me a free book.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,880
 Thank you very much to listener Bridget, who I had said I'd pay postage for three Tade Thompson novels,

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,240
 and she very kindly waived it because it was a good joke.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,440
 Liz: *laughs*

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,800
 John: So thank you Bridget!

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:33,920
 *music*

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,400
 John: Hello everyone and welcome to the very 105th episode of Octothorpe.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,360
 This episode is coming to you on the 14th of March 2024.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,040
 I'm John Coxon.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,400
 Alison: I'm Alison Scott.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,760
 Liz: And I'm Liz Batty.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,560
 John: We heard from some people.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,080
 Alison: Ang wrote us a long interesting letter about the Hugo controversy,

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,600
 which we're going to cover later when we talk about the Hugo controversy.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,800
 And meanwhile, she says she liked my Gregg Wallace reference so there.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,560
 John: It was a good Gregg Wallace reference once you had explained it to me and Liz,

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,520
 both of whom had no idea about Gregg Wallace.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,280
 Alison:But who have now been sending me Gregg Wallace memes for four weeks, so you know.

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,360
 John: Oh yeah, now we know about Gregg Wallace.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,800
Like, now we're clued in.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,000
 Alison: I just, this is maybe the only time I understand the popular culture meme before either of you two do,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
 so I'm milking it.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,280
 Liz: We also got a letter from Andy Openshaw saying,

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,840
 "Why is no one talking about *A Murder at the End of the World*?

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
 I thought that was canny good and deserves to be in contention."

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,120
 I did think about *A Murder at the End of the World*, but the ending is rubbish.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,640
 I mean, I think it is science fiction, but it's not at all interesting for its science

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,520
 fictional elements.

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,440
 It could be, but I think it kind of has too many flaws to really be interesting.

32
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,400
 John: An example of this, I think, is the, there was a show called *The Resort* in 2022,

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,480
 which was great and had genre elements, but kind of ended on a damp squib.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,920
 And I think, I think that was a similar thing where I would have loved to

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
 nominate it, but ultimately I just felt like it didn't quite stick the landing in a way that made

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,040
 it feel fulfilling.

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,400
 And so like this, this can be a problem with limited SF shows.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
 So yeah, it's sad when it happens.

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,520
 Liz: Yeah, I mean, I should say it's all about kind of, you know, the end of the world they're in is kind of

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,200
 a tech billionaire's Icelandic hideout against climate change.

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,080
 And it's got that kind of it is, you know, 10 seconds in the future thing going on,

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
 but then in the end, I don't think it says anything super interesting about it.

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,320
 And I had figured out the murder too early.

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,520
 It's all right though.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,640
 Alison: But I had never even heard of it. So thanks for the recommendation.

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,800
 John: And I, and Andy also messaged me on Saturday when we were both doing our Hugo nominations.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,360
He messaged me asking why some things are listed in the long form tab of the Hugo Spreadsheet 

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
 of Doom and some things are listed in the short form.

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
 And he was like, why? Why does that happen?

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,680
 And I basically told him that it's whatever people reckoned they wanted to put on whichever tab.

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
 There's no unified mind behind it.

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,800
 And so it kind of gives you a clue as to where people are thinking of nominating things.

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
 But yeah, there's not much more order than that.

54
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,320
 John: When did you do your Hugo nominations peeps?

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,120
 Liz: Couple of weeks ago.

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
 Alison: So I did get up yesterday morning.

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
 This was Saturday, thinking, oh, I should probably nominate for the Hugos today.

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,560
 Let me check where the deadline is.

59
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,440
 And then I got involved in many other things.

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
 And then I remembered again.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,880
 And at that point it was 12 minutes past three.

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,680
 The deadline was four o'clock and I was like, whoops, I hope the website doesn't go down.

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,320
 But in fact, the website seemed very resilient and was having no problems with people who

64
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,120
 left it to the last minute.

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,480
 No doubt because there weren't very many of us and everyone else had done it in good time.

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,560
 But I did it at three-fifteen and I was not the only one on, on our Discord server who had done it at three-

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,840
 fifteen. So there we go.

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
 And Steven didn't do it till three-forty-five and was then like, who should I nominate?

69
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
 Do you have any ideas?

70
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,160
 We were like, we made a list in the last Octothorpe, go look at that.

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,280
 John: So Chris also speaks about the same mysterious thing that Ang spoke of.

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,960
 So we will talk about that later.

73
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,520
 But he also says Paul Doerr isn't Zodiac.

74
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,560
 My dad would have known Doerr and it's quite possible I met him in my very young years.

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
 Neither of us were murdered.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,720
 So it can't be him.

77
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,120
 Thanks for writing in Chris.

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,200
 What I love is Chris can drop names in any situation.

79
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,400
 You need a name drop.

80
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,760
 Chris Garcia is your guy.

81
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:39,760
 Spacecraft: Chris Garcia, serial killer: Chris Garcia, anyone else in the world: Chris Garcia.

82
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,040
 Alison: Old computers.

83
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
 John: Old computers: Chris Garcia.

84
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,920
 He also apparently does a podcast about Zodiac called *Zodiac Speaking*

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,120
 and we will link in the show notes.

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,640
Alison: What, Chris does?

87
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,000
 Because of course he does.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,880
 John: Of course he does.

89
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,320
 Chris Garcia Renaissance man.

90
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,680
 Alison: Chris does everything.

91
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,080
 If Zodiac does turn out to be Paul Doerr Chris, that podcast is technically eligible.

92
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,560
 for Fancast.

93
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,000
 Ersatz Culture and Raj had a chat in our Mastodon mentions in which they note that

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,600
**The City of Last Chances** was published in the US in December 2022 as a simultaneous ebook release.

95
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,240
 So it is not in fact eligible.

96
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,840
 We regret the error.

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,520
Alison: Oh s*** I've nominated it.

98
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,120
 Should have nominated the second one.

99
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,800
John: Ersatz Culture wrote to say **Children of Memory** is actually eligible because it only became

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
 available in the States in January 2023.

101
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
 So yes thank you.

102
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,960
 That was too late for us to include it before nominations shut.

103
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,040
 Hopefully no one got themselves in a knot with that information.

104
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,560
 Alison: Martin Easterbrook writes to say for scholars of the constitution.

105
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,120
 Do we have any scholars of the constitution in the house?

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,880
Alison and John: na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na BatLiz!

107
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,220
 Alison: at what point does someone officially become a Hugo winner? This is like at what point somebody

108
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,500
 is officially... this is like at what point does somebody become king? and the use of kings

109
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,040
 to impart messages over vast distance because they have the divine right of kings once

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,880
 they're kings? So if you keep a supply of kings and kill one on the home planet then you can

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:27,320
 impart a message by because the person or the the heir on the far planet is now is now king

112
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,680
 and so has the divine has the divine right of kings and so can do king things and so thereby

113
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,520
 you know that something that something has happened but anyway at what point does somebody

114
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,640
 officially become Hugo winner and I assume it is at the point where their name is read

115
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,120
 out on stage?  John: I'm gonna say I think this is the sort of question that arises from hanging

116
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,960
 out in the WSFS business meeting Discord I think it's when they win a Hugo. Alison: When their

117
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,800
 name is read out on stage because he's got the name he's got the word officially in his

118
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,040
 thing. John: What's what's the counter argument to it being that?  What are the options? Liz: We know

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,200
 that **La La Land's** name was read out on stage and did not win Best Picture Oscar because

120
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,760
 they gave him the wrong envelope so what if we gave someone the wrong envelope? Alison: Yes but

121
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,640
 the Hugos would never make a mistake like that Liz: Would we then just have to declare that

122
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,600
 was the winner because that seems like a maybe not great system Alison: Okay I'll amend this, at the

123
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,760
 point at which the correct winner is read out on stage, will that do? John: On the subject of

124
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,920
 another thing Martin Easterbrook wrote, he asked in a previous episode you know whether or

125
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,880
 not basically he argued that this had happened before at western Worldcons sorry he happened

126
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,840
 the thing that happened that Chengdu with it being slowly taken over by a group outside

127
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,000
 of fandom had happened before at western Worldcons and like no one was really talking about

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,480
 that and España Sheriff sent in a link to a discussion of the 1987 World Science Fiction

129
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,360
 Convention in which the Scientologists tried to steal the Worldcon and if you read this

130
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,320
 article I think it becomes very clear that people did have extremely strong opinions

131
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,200
 about this and those extremely extremely strong opinions were no no no! So I think I think

132
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,280
 when this happened in the UK people were also hopping mad. Alison: oh yeah they were apoplectic and

133
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,200
 I was there at the time and if you read the article that España links to it was more

134
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,400
 it wasn't quite they were trying to take over the Worldcon; they were trying to get undue

135
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,760
 influence through sponsorship.  This is more close to the Raytheon thing and because the Worldcon

136
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,320
 was very short of money and this is a problem with with the way that Worldcons

137
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,800
 are sometimes very short of money, they made some decisions that they absolutely should

138
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,280
 not have made but it didn't they didn't realize how bad it was going to be until it had happened

139
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,240
 and you know there were other things about about that Worldcon. It was my first Worldcon,

140
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,840
 I was so excited. I spent the entire time being in an advanced state of excitement. 

141
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:55,160
 Liz: We also heard from Tammy Coxon who we well we kind of called out last episode for saying

142
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,400
 that Worldcon is dying and I thought she left us a very reasonable comment saying you know

143
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,120
 fair enough for calling it out which is if nothing else it's a very nice way of doing

144
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,400
 the discourse in which we don't get annoyed with each other we just have a conversation

145
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,680
 and she just say yes she thinks she's seeing a lot of enthusiasm maybe coming out of Europe

146
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,120
 and maybe less out of other places and yet that it is just really really hard to run

147
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,040
 a Worldcon right now and she has chaired a Worldcon and can't imagine, sorry she used

148
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,720
 to want to chair a Worldcon she has chaired a NASFiC, and can't imagine doing it again. I

149
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,160
 mean I can't imagine charing a Worldcon but fortunately we seem to have enough people

150
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,120
 who do want to do that that it's working at the moment and I do hope that maybe the

151
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,880
 current Hugo thing will lead to some productive changes that will help motivate more people

152
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,760
 to want to run Worldcon, so thank you Tammy. Alison: I'd agree with that. JohN: yeah thank you very much

153
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:55,600
 for leaving a comment Tammy and and being very gracious about us. I want to say one thing

154
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,200
 I want to pick up one thing from the comment which is I'm not she says I'm not a business

155
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,040
 meeting fan and I'd love to figure out a way for us to run the organization more fairly

156
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,560
 in a way that makes running Worldcon something more people want to do. I think there are a

157
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,640
 lot of people who try to intersect with running the Worldcon at a high level and they intersect

158
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,560
 with the business meeting and they're like oh no I cannot do this. I think there is a conversation

159
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:24,040
 we need to have about the fact that the business meeting massively enforces the group of people

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,000
 who work on the Worldcon and massively puts off the people who currently don't and so

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,520
 if we're going to have this conversation we need to have a serious conversation about

162
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,680
 what the business meeting does to people who might want to get involved because I think

163
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,160
 it puts a lot of people off. Alison: I have thinks here and the main one is that the vast majority

164
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,400
 of people who work on Worldcons, including working on Worldcons at high level, aren't

165
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,840
 really very involved in the business meeting. They'll kind of go along to present their

166
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:01,080
 bid and to accept if they win, but only a very small proportion of Worldcon runners have

167
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,280
 anything to do with the business meeting. John: Yes. Alison: And the vast majority of people who work

168
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,320
 on Worldcons think the business meeting is just as mad as everybody else does. The only

169
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,720
 people who don't think the business meeting is mad is the set of people who like the business

170
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,560
 meeting, which is quite a small set of people. John: Yes.I completely agree with everything you've

171
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,200
 just said, but I think if you want to get involved with running the Worldcon, naively a lot of

172
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,320
 people who don't really know how it works go to the business meeting because they're

173
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
 like this is where the decisions are made and I think that belies the fact that most

174
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
 of the decisions are actually made in committee but I don't think that's transparent to new

175
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,320
 members at all and so I think you have this core of people who would quite like to be

176
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,000
 involved in the Worldcon at quite a high level and the business meeting is basically

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,360
 this giant distracting put off. Alison: Agreed. If you want to get involved in running Worldcons,

178
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,600
 including getting involved at a high level, so what you do is you email volunteers@glasgow2024.org

179
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,560
 and they'll give you a little job to do and then you'll find that

180
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,080
 people resign above you as things as things go terribly wrong and then suddenly you'll

181
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,880
 be working on the Worldcon at a high level, that's how it works. John: Ah, would that it were not

182
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,320
 so. Alison: but honestly if you want to get involved in the world calls at a high level that is

183
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,040
 my top tip. It will work, sorry Esther. Liz: I've got nothing to say about business meetings

184
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,080
 because I think we've really covered that ground before and we shouldn't do it again

185
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,880
 unless we have something new to discuss. John: Fair. Alison: We definitely will sometime but maybe not

186
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,720
 today.  Sandra Bond wrote to us – we did get a lot of letters this week – and said Liz: It's

187
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,120
 because we haven't recorded for a month. Alison: We should record every two weeks, shouldn't we? Except

188
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,400
 when we don't. "I finally caught up with you once again while driving around after Corflu

189
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,640
 and nearly swerved off the road into a New Mexico canyon when I heard you once again

190
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,120
 plug me for a Hugo nomination." Okay so we have a kind of listeners advice here which

191
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:01,360
 is if the contents of the audio you're listening to while driving might make you swerve don't

192
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,800
 listen to it while driving. Listen to stuff that won't make you swerve seriously. John: Well this

193
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,760
 is this is partly my fault because I do the trigger warnings in the show notes and it didn't

194
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,800
 occur to me to put this as a trigger but it probably is one so we will endeavour to be

195
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,240
 better about it in future Sandra but no and not only did we plug Sandra I nominated Sandra

196
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,720
 on Saturday boom. Other things on Sandra's letter. Perhaps you could find

197
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,600
 a few seconds to plug my first collection of verse, Poetry Slum due out at Eastercon

198
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,400
 I did my Kipling pistiche about Dave McCarty won't be in it so you'll have to wait for

199
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,120
 her second collection of poetry if you want to read that and she has sent us the covers

200
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,040
 which we'll put in as the chapter art, chapter art? John: Yes we will link it somewhere Alison: and I was

201
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,000
 wondering whether I might, to whet everybody's appetite, read out the poem from the back from

202
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,640
 the blurb that gave her the title for this. If you want to score sestinas or a baggy

203
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,600
 of blank verse, you can buy them on the dark net then again you could do worse than slip

204
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,400
 down to the sleazy spot where the versifiers come and speak to the suppliers down in the

205
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:25,920
 Poetry Slum. John: I do like Sandra. Alison: I like Sandra and I like Sandra's poetry a whole lot, a lot of

206
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,420
 her poetry is really good. John: finally bring us home Liz. Liz: Actually we got two more cos I missed

207
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:37,080
 one. We heard from Murphy's lawyer on Bluesky.  We're on Bluesky I'm trying to be actually

208
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,560
 doing stuff on Bluesky by the way. Alison: that's Harry Payne. Liz: Harry Payne who has been sideloading

209
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:50,440
 our podcasts on to their e-reader so you there's a picture of like Octothorpe with the logo

210
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,040
 in black and white on a Kobo. I didn't even know you can do that but it's quite impressive

211
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,960
 it might be easier just to like put em on your phone if anyone knows out there listening listening

212
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:07,200
 to Octothorpe on a fridge or a toaster or you know 1983 Unix workstation please please drop

213
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,120
 us a line. Alison: I was gonna say if you're listening to Octothorpe on a pregnancy test please let

214
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,020
 us know. Liz: Nicholas Jackson Jackson also sent some messages on Bluesky say the discussion of

215
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:24,840
 Hugo Popes, Cardinals, etc reminded him of a costume from the masquerade at eastercon 1999

216
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:32,120
 which is Andrew Patterson as St Hugo of fandom and he sent a picture of Saint Hugo of fandom

217
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,600
 so we'll put that in the show notes for you all. Thank you very much Nicholas. John: Anyway that

218
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:51,960
 was letters letters letters of comment. Boom, commented. Now let's look at the BSFA Award

219
00:15:51,960 --> 00:16:00,840
 shortlist. We have questions. I've not discussed this with my fellow co-hosts but I feel confident

220
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:07,760
 that we have questions do you guys have questions? Alison: oh about the BSFA shortlist? John: yes so the so one

221
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,000
 thing we should say is I believe from the long list best translated short fiction did not

222
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 get a lot of submissions and they have transitioned it to being a juried award. I don't know whether

223
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,600
 this is permanent or whether this is just this year or what exactly the deal is but it has

224
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,120
 definitely happened. Liz: When it says this award is selected by an appointed BSFA jury does

225
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,720
 that mean the short lists are selected by a jury or the voting like the whole thing is

226
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,520
 done by jury because a jury shortlist with a public vote sounds pretty good. John: I don't know.

227
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,280
 Alison: If I click on the voting form in my email from the BSFA I can see if I can vote for it

228
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,240
 or not right? John: Yes you have to bear in mind that neither me nor Liz got that voting form.

229
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,120
 Alison: because you're not BSFA members? John: yes indeed. Alison: Right. No I am not being given an option to

230
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,920
 vote on it so it is a juried award. John: wahey. Thank you for finding that out, Alison. Liz: I will, I will

231
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:07,080
 note that Best Short Fiction is now things which are shorter than Best Shorter Fiction

232
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,960
 I don't know I find I still find that a little bit confusing. Alison: so shorter fiction's like novellas

233
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,680
 and novellas? John: yeah and then short fiction is shorter fiction than shorter fiction, it's

234
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,560
 shorterer. Liz: Yeah. John: And then you have best nonfiction short and best nonfiction long because they've

235
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,520
 changed it! I noticed when I first looked at this this page they were not templated similarly

236
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,840
 and I was a bit like come on guys but they've changed it so they are so that's good, good

237
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,480
 BSFA. Shall we stop talking about our annoyances about quibberly little pedantic things and

238
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,600
 talk about the actual works well I mean the reason I'm talking about this is because I

239
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,000
 actually am not familiar with most of the works right so one of the things that was

240
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,720
 noticed when this went up which is the under Best Short Fiction which is for fiction that's

241
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:02,360
 longer than short fiction The Book of Gaheris was listed by Kari Sperring as one of the

242
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,560
 nominees but that has been replaced with Knotted Thorn which is one of the stories from The

243
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,640
 Book of Gaheris which is good because Knotted Thorn is eligible and as far as I understood

244
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,560
 it the full book was not but I think that was probably just an error by the BSFA. It does

245
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,600
 look like they have they've gone through and fixed some of the mistakes which is really

246
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,640
 nice because the first version of this shortlist they had not and it is good that they have

247
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,560
 Yeah I mean I'm gonna call out that I actually haven't read any of the novels unusually but

248
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:38,040
 in Best Nonfiction Long we do have the collections of essays by Neil Harrison All These Worlds

249
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,920
 and A Traveller in Time: the critical practice of Maureen Kincaid Speller which we suggested

250
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,680
 for the Hugo nominations a few weeks ago and there's also quite a lot of interesting stuff

251
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:54,840
 in the best nonfiction short category like there's a interesting looking set of essays

252
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,520
 there with everything from Fiona Moore's Project Management lessons from Rogue One but also

253
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,920
 there's one about the burden of writing from the margins, there's one about dominant themes

254
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,080
 in Afrocentric Fiction by Eugene Bacon it looks like a really strong shortlist although

255
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,680
 I have not read all of them yet and it's nice that the BSFA has continued to kind of recognise

256
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,600
 that because I know there was a while where the BSFA Best Nonfiction I think there were

257
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,040
 a few years where it wasn't awarded or then it became jureed and so on but it does seem

258
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,000
 like now there's enough people reading and nominating things to justify having two categories

259
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,680
 for this which is pretty nice. Yeah, no, it looks like a vibrant shortlist and you can

260
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,560
 vote on the shortlist if you are a member of the BSFA or a member of Eastercon, Levitation

261
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,680
 it actually says attendees of the Convention Levitation 2024 but I assume it actually means

262
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:51,200
 anyone who's got a membership in levitation not many people who turn up on site so historically

263
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,240
 it was paper ballots at the Eastercon but I assume they'll have a mechanism for people

264
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,080
 to vote online because otherwise that would be a bit mad wouldn't it I'm pretty sure you

265
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,360
 couldn't even paper ballot last time I did it I just had to log in and do it on my phone

266
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,800
 at Eastercon. I hope so because if I'm thinking about a virtual membership to levitation partly

267
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,200
 so I can also vote in the BSFA awards so if I don't get a vote then it takes away a

268
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,080
 little bit of the value of my virtual membership and also seems a bit weird that I don't get

269
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,560
 a vote because I am geographically too far away and cannot make the Eastercon.

270
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
 Eastercon!

271
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
 Yes!

272
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
 We're excited about Eastercon!

273
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
 Levitation.

274
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,440
 I am excited about Eastercon which is Levitation in Telford it is not too late for you to join

275
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,040
 and also if you don't fancy getting to Telford there's a virtual membership and a full virtual

276
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,040
 convention I'm going to say much like we had last year but I think they're using a slightly

277
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,640
 different system for that. Social events will be happening on a Discord and there's going

278
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,040
 to be I don't think they've announced them yet but I think I'm going to say so that people

279
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,040
 are excited about it that there are going to be some social events in advance on Discord

280
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,720
 so that you can hang out with people and if you haven't been to an Eastercon see what

281
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,680
 it's like and talk to people about it and make plans for Telford and so on They'll

282
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,480
 be happening in the week before Easter but just in case because I think if there is

283
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,640
 another episode of Octothorpe so the next episode of Octothorpe. will be on Maundy Thursday

284
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,960
 so it'll be before then so I'm mentioning them now even though they're not announced

285
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,600
 yet but they'll be happening the week before Easter so that you can get used to Discord

286
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,360
 make sure you're logged into Discord before the convention so that we don't have to sort

287
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,960
 it all out on Maundy Thursday and by we I don't really mean me I mean Andrew Emily and other people

288
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,800
 like that and maybe me a bit and then John, are you doing anything at Eastercon? I'm running

289
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,560
 the newsletter I'm excited about Eastercon I'm also a bit sad because I will not be at

290
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,840
 Eastercon I will be watching from afar but on the other hand that means I also won't be

291
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,560
 on a rail replacement bus to Telford so I have made some good choices in life yes oh

292
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,440
 yes enjoy listening to Octothorpe on Maundy Thursday while you are on the rail replacement

293
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,880
 bus everyone. yes so there's there's been some sort of landslide between Shrewsbury

294
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,600
 and Telford. I think they call it a landslip because that sounds less alarming. There's

295
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:18,440
 been a there's been a geophysical buggery in between Telford and other places. The report

296
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,880
 I saw from National Rail basically said they are trying to clear it up before the 31st

297
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,840
 which does firstly mean that it might get done before but also means it might not so

298
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,120
 yes if you're planning to travel by train be aware. There are trains to Telford they're just

299
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,960
 doing rail replacement at the weekends there probably will be a rail replacement on Good

300
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,800
 Friday and Easter Monday I think they had already announced they weren't going to be

301
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,320
 trains those days I think you might be alright on Maundy Thursday I don't want to guarantee

302
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,280
 it though. Alison will stake her reputation on it there was a report on this that confused

303
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,160
 two things which was that there was rail replacement services over the weekend because it was a

304
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,720
 weekend but also the landslip which has affected the trains but not to the point that they're

305
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,360
 not running. I will say that last time there was a landslip and it was affecting the trains

306
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,880
 I went to the station and they said oh yeah, it'll be fine it'll go a bit slower through

307
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,840
 the land slip bit, but you should be fine. I got all my money back for that train journey and

308
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:25,640
 the conductor even gave us free crisps because we were stuck for so long. so yeah. I

309
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,880
 now do have an ordered list of games which I will buy if I ever get delay repay for anything

310
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,760
 The Coxon technique. It's probably my best achievement which given I have like a PhD thesis

311
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:47,320
 bit bit conflicting.

312
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:54,120
 Shall we discuss the Hugos? Yes. Now I know we don't really talk about the Hugos very much

313
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,400
 on this podcast. In fact I think we talk about them so much I've made that joke before

314
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,200
 haven't I? So we pre-recorded the last episode because we knew we needed to do it and get

315
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,280
 it out before the Hugo nomination deadline which meant we have not commented on several

316
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:15,240
 new aspects of the 2023 Hugo ever-evolving big clusterf*ck thing.  The main thing that was

317
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,760
 reported was a big report from Chris Barkley and Jason Sanford which I'm gonna say is

318
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,760
 a pretty long report and covers quite a lot of stuff but the main thing in it is they managed

319
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,440
 to get some emails which were released by Diane Lacey who was on the Hugo administration

320
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,280
 team for Chengdu which essentially show exactly what was going on during some bits of the

321
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,160
 Hugo process.  So they released these emails and these emails basically show a couple of

322
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,520
 things.  One, they show Dave McCarty emailing his team and saying when you are reviewing

323
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,720
 the nominees don't just review them for technical eligibility please highlight anything of a

324
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,240
 sensitive political nature that being defined as work focusing on China, Taiwan, Tibet or other

325
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,840
 topics that may be an issue in China. Which is basically a very broad slate isn't it? And

326
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:13,480
 then there's a few more emails that basically discuss exactly what they were finding in some

327
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,360
 of the the Hugo finalists. I think dossiers. There are dossiers. So the two things so there

328
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,280
 are these emails from Diane Lacey which are basically they were going through trying to

329
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:30,280
 like say what might be issues with some of the potential finalists and they released

330
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,680
 for instance the big one about like Fan Writer which has a lot of really random things like

331
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:44,880
 'Alastiar Stuart wants to go to a Batman hotel in Taiwan'. Blog reviews that mention China

332
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,580
 you know shares a bunch of news about it. The thing that really pulled this up is it's

333
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,880
 just basically like doing some googling but doing some googling incompetently. For instance

334
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,080
 they said that Paul Weimer who was removed from the final ballot traveled to Tibet and

335
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,880
 tweeted pictures and talked about food.  But he hadn't been to Tibet. And yet they also

336
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,080
 missed other finalists who have been to Tibet. And the other thing that came out of this

337
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,000
 is there's a a nomination spreadsheet it's called validation and it basically is where

338
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,120
 they were doing these validation things and writing you know known issues possible issues

339
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,200
 minor issues or whatever but what it also shows is that this is presumably the raw

340
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,640
 output of the first run of E pluribus Hugo and there's a bunch of items on there which

341
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,320
 were not on the final ballot. And if you look at the emails that were sent between Dave

342
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,280
 as well it also says and I'm gonna just find this and quote. "Tomorrow I have a four hour

343
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,400
 meeting with my Chinese counterpart to look at ballot detail and determine if any ballots

344
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,400
 are to be voided which happens with frequency so it's not really that controversial if we

345
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:57,640
 determine we need to do it." mmm yeah. So it's also clear that they voided a bunch of ballots

346
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,160
 basically saying that there was some kind of slate voting going on which appears to just

347
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,080
 be have been people voting for the same things off a nomination list although it's quite

348
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,480
 complicated it may not be exactly that, but that's what we have to assume and then they

349
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,080
 rerun EPH and got a new set of finalists and if you look at this you know spreadsheet

350
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,240
 called validation I think it's clear there are like a couple of different runs of EPH

351
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,040
 on it some after they had pulled out a bunch of ballots and then a few extra things get

352
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,240
 on and then there's also this mysterious thing called the invitation list which appears to

353
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,080
 be things they were going to check because they thought they might end up on the final

354
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,840
 list, but they're not under the first run of EPH so I assume most of you have seen

355
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,160
 this at this point but basically what we can say is they did extremely incompetent weird

356
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,680
 vetting to try and find political issues and then seem to start iranably remove people

357
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,680
 who had said something about something that might be controversial but also that they just

358
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,160
 basically threw out a bunch of ballots. And that's a large bunch of ballots to be clear,

359
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,640
 maybe most of them. I wanted to just mention a couple of other things that are just old

360
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,940
 history now but probably in case our listeners don't know.

361
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,880
 Kat Jones, who had previously told me that she was involved only at a very early stage

362
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,720
 with the Hugo eligibility process, but was at the time the Hugo administrator for Glasgow

363
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,800
 turned out to be one of the people who compiled these sets of sets of information about possible

364
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,920
 candidates and she has now resigned from her post at Glasgow as has everybody else who

365
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,120
 has had anything to do with this and Glasgow has a whole new Hugo team.

366
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
 Good.

367
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,560
 Under Nicholas Whyte who has also written a blog post which we'll link to saying actually

368
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,240
 I really didn't have anything to do with this and I did try to volunteer for China but

369
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,760
 was but never heard anything back seemed to have dodged a bullet there.

370
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:48,240
 I may be paraphrasing there but goes on to say a little bit about his philosophy in running

371
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,760
 Hugos which won't be which will not be a surprise to anyone who's worked with Nicholas

372
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,680
 on anything to do with this.

373
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,600
 So I think that's a good post that's useful from Nicholas and hopefully everything is

374
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,080
 fine for this year's Hugo administration and Glasgow has been very careful to make it

375
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,200
 straightforward for Chinese nominators to nominate in this year's Hugos which of course

376
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,800
 they can do as members of Chengdu.

377
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,800
 I speculated many moons ago that the reason that we hadn't seen the Fan Writer or Fanzine

378
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:26,840
 part of the Hugo packet was because there was some snafu with it at a Chinese censorship

379
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,520
 level and it this very much supports that theory.

380
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,480
 So there were people at the time who were not convinced that that was a fair take but

381
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,760
 it turns out that it was.

382
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,760
 We all wanted to be optimistic about the Chengdu Worldcom but there was evidence that it was

383
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,760
 going weird quite early on that I think no one really wanted to believe was true and

384
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,600
 has tragically turned out to be very true which is frustrating.

385
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,960
 I can't believe that Kat Jones didn't immediately disclaim all of this as soon as the discourse

386
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,720
 started like I don't understand how she didn't expect it to come out like I would have

387
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,000
 just been like yes.

388
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,920
 Because if you had apologized if you had come clean and apologized at the point the

389
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,120
 stats dropped you'd still be the Hugo administrator.

390
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:21,280
 Or at the very least you wouldn't be persona non grata forever but at this point if Kat

391
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:27,160
 Jones is ever on a Worldcom committee again or like a Worldcom team again I will be extremely

392
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,280
 angry and I think there was a way to manage that that would have made me much less angry.

393
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,960
 I'm not sure if that's fair because it's clear that what she did was do the work and

394
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,840
 then have second thoughts and you know people make mistakes.

395
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,240
 She made a couple of mistakes actually so doing the work was a mistake but then also

396
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,240
 when it started to come to light she was kind of how dare Diane releases emails rather

397
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,120
 than Diane Lacey let's be clear here was completely correct to release these emails.

398
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,280
 It was absolutely the right thing to do.

399
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,800
 It's never too late to start making good decisions.

400
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,480
 And it's hard to sort of say oh but they're private email should I release them?

401
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,120
 No you definitely should.

402
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,280
 Definitely definitely should.

403
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,280
 There's also a thing here which so Dave McCarty was the Hugo administrator for at least one

404
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,160
 of the puppy years and apparently quite happy to throw out slates by Chinese voters but

405
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,000
 not happy to throw out slates by fascists.

406
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,640
 I don't know what to do with that information at all.

407
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,600
 Makes me very stressed out.

408
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,680
 I think the I want to be slightly careful about what I say here but some American fans

409
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:33,920
 including some fascists are very litigious so it's not impossible that Dave felt that

410
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,360
 if he had thrown out ballots from puppies, puppies would have sued, and that that would

411
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,480
 be a worse outcome than not throwing out the ballots.

412
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,760
 I don't think he thought that random Chinese voters would be suing.

413
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,360
 I think I would prefer that interpretation to many others.

414
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,920
 But also always look for interpretations that don't require people to be actively evil.

415
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,560
 I don't think very many people are actively evil.

416
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,640
 I think they just make bad decisions and they compound in a way that gets you into situations

417
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,120
 that are difficult to get out of.

418
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,640
 That gets complicated when you talk about stuff like dog whistles and how I think there is

419
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,960
 a group of actors in every community that is very good at exploiting that inclination.

420
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,760
 And that's the problem when it comes to that.

421
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,640
 Liz, have you got anything on any of those scorching hot two-week-old?

422
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,840
 No, more than two-week-old takes.

423
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,000
 Scorching hot month-old takes?

424
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Yeah.

425
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Hey.

426
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,360
 So yeah, I mean I think I would fall on.

427
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,040
 You don't throw out slate ballots.

428
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:37,840
 We came up with a way to basically make a fairer nomination system given the existence of slate

429
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
 ballots.

430
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,960
 And I think we use that.

431
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,920
 And if you basically use your ways of down-ranking stuff that's on slate and they're still

432
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,080
 at the top, then they're still at the top.

433
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,600
 So I'd say a couple of things.

434
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
 Yeah.

435
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,080
 So one is...

436
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,680
 One take I've seen is that this was Western fandom in the form of Dave McCarty, Kat Jones

437
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,400
 and Diane Lacey doing this.

438
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,840
 It was all coming from the Western Fandom's house and we were doing it to China.

439
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,960
 I think if you read these emails, which are all being sent when Dave is actually in China

440
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,520
 meeting with a lot of the team, it's clearly not just one side of the Hugo administration

441
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
 team.

442
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,640
 It is with his Chinese counterpart.

443
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,040
 They say they're going to have a discussion with his Chinese counterpart and so on.

444
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:26,280
 I think you can say that it was the Hugo administration f*cking over all the voters,

445
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,840
 both Chinese and non-Chinese.

446
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,200
 But I don't think you can say it was entirely like Western fandom doing this of their own

447
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
 accord.

448
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,560
 We just don't have those emails or those emails don't exist.

449
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,520
 Yeah, no, absolutely.

450
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,440
 I think the emails make it as clear as clear can be.

451
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,000
 The emails make it very clear.

452
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Yeah.

453
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 I mean, I'm also, I will also say that I am...

454
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,440
 I don't know, weirdly slightly offended that it appears that whoever's vetting the podcast

455
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,120
 didn't bother to listen to any of the podcasts, because they're all down as no issues.

456
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,040
 We've been criticising China.

457
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
 Why were we on the ballot?

458
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
 Boo.

459
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,640
 But I don't think we were the only podcast to bring up issues around China and the Chengdu

460
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
 Worldcon.

461
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,760
 Kat and Diane did not get down to podcasts.

462
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,560
 What happened was that Kat in her...

463
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
 What?

464
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
 Yes, they did.

465
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
 Yeah, they did.

466
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,160
 Because it says no issues in Kat's column on the spreadsheet.

467
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
 Oh.

468
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
 Yep.

469
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
 Yeah.

470
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,480
 How dare you say there are no issues with our podcast?

471
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,280
 There are many issues.

472
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
 Mostly harmless.

473
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,200
 If we're going to say, if we're talking about people not reading the emails, then I am going

474
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,600
 to have to ding you for not reading the spreadsheet.

475
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,720
 We have no issues, guys.

476
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,440
 I certainly have no issues.

477
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
 Do you have no issues?

478
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
 I know.

479
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,480
 I don't think any of us have been to Tibet or Taiwan either.

480
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
 But, you know...

481
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
 No, no.

482
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
 I'd love to.

483
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,400
 Yeah, I'd love to go to Tibet.

484
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,440
 I would very much like to go to Taiwan.

485
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,400
 Also to make it clear, free Tibet, Taiwan is an independent country.

486
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,000
 Solidarity with Hong Kong.

487
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Anyway, so...

488
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,360
 But Ada Palmer's thing about self-censorship is relevant here because they did a much more

489
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:10,040
 thorough job than was probably required by their Chinese paymasters, right?

490
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,040
 Yes, I think...

491
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,280
 I mean, I don't know because as Liz says, we don't...

492
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,400
 get an insight into the Chinese side of the committee anywhere near as good as the one we have into

493
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,520
 the western side of the committee.

494
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,800
 But I would be astounded if this was like coming from the Chinese government.

495
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,280
 I suspect it's coming from the people in the Chinese half of the subcommittee who are

496
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,560
 aware of the sorts of things they need to be doing to make sure that they don't get in

497
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
 trouble.

498
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,960
 So I think it's exactly what ADA Palmer says in that article about, you know, you get good

499
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
 at...

500
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
 Self-censorship.

501
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,160
 Yeah, I mean, I mean, they're also presuming at this point thinking, these are all the people

502
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,680
 we are going to invite on an, you know, expenses-paid trip and potentially give them a big microphone

503
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,880
 if we give them an award to stand at the front and say whatever they like.

504
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,720
 And so they probably were thinking we want to exclude anyone who might use that microphone

505
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,960
 to say something extremely controversial.

506
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,280
 For instance, the Octothorpe podcast, how dare they...

507
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,200
 I'm making it perhaps a little bit too much about us, so we should move on from that.

508
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,600
 There have been some great takes about this on the Internet since we last recorded.

509
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:20,680
 I do want to specifically flag up James Bacon wrote in Journey Planet a scorching article

510
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,560
 about all of this, which is extremely angry in an extremely good way.

511
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,520
 And I will put a link to that issue of Journey Planet in the show notes.

512
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,880
 And I know that him and Chris have invited Paul Weimer to collaborate on an issue examining

513
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,480
 kind of where we go from here, which is very interesting.

514
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,600
 I've heard of multiple people who are working on various proposals for where we go from here.

515
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,160
 If you have any thoughts, you're happy for us to broadcast and discuss on a future episode.

516
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,800
 Please do let us know.

517
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,560
 I got one more thing to say about the Hugos.

518
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,840
 And we're getting into a very dry side of things now.

519
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,040
 Like we weren't before.

520
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:02,200
 But we talked before about how the Worldcon Intellectual Property Corporation is the thing

521
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,040
 that basically controls the Hugo trademarks.

522
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,520
 And they had various meetings from which we know about the censures for Dave McCarty,

523
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,040
 Ben Yalow and Chen Shi.

524
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:16,080
 And also the resignation of Dave McCarty, and also the resignation of Kevin Standlee as chair

525
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,920
 and who went back down to being a regular board member.

526
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,480
 But they did release the minutes of these meetings, which don't tell you very much,

527
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,720
 except they do tell you the number of people who voted in favour and against the censures.

528
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,720
 Oh, I did not see that.

529
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,480
 Well analysed, Liz.

530
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,600
 So I mean, I'm a bit confused because I was trying to count how many people were at the

531
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
 meeting.

532
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:41,760
 And I think some members of the board must have abstained or not voted in these votes.

533
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,640
 But it's not listed because it just lists in favor and against.

534
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,800
 So you don't know if people have abstained.

535
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:52,200
 But anyway, they voted by 10 to 3 to censure Dave McCarty and then 8 to 5 to censure Dave

536
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,680
 McCarty, Ben Yalow and Chen Shi.

537
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,240
 And 8 to 6 to recommend Kevin Standlee, which is interesting.

538
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,480
 So if you want to try and figure out who the 10 to 3, 8 to 5 and 8 to 6 were, well, have

539
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
 fun.

540
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,400
 I mean, I think, and I think one of the things that comes out of all of this is that it wasn't

541
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,280
 just Dave.

542
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,880
 Like until the Lacey emails came out, there was this narrative that maybe Dave had done it

543
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
 all.

544
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,240
 And it turns out everyone on that subcommittee is culpable probably.

545
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,840
 And Ben Yalow was on that subcommittee.

546
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:33,120
 And I've had this image of Ben as a generally all right, nice bloke who sometimes a bit

547
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,880
 vague and now I've got a very different image of him in my head.

548
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,960
 And as we said earlier, Nicholas Whyte has become the Hugo Han Solo.

549
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,320
 Well, I mean, when I think of definite rule following, constitution abiding role models

550
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,760
 from science fiction, I don't think Han Solo.

551
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,180
 But I mean, I haven't read any of the extended universe novels, so I could be completely

552
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
 misrepresenting him.

553
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,680
 I would recommend not doing.

554
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:06,080
 Ang wrote to us, Ang Rosin wrote to us with quote, a bit of a rant, which we are cutting a little

555
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,520
 bit, about the Hugos.

556
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,760
 She says she's seen the story develop and right up to the report by Jason Sanford and

557
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,720
 Chris Barkley. Quite a lot of stuff has happened since then.

558
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,320
 But indeed, we haven't been here.

559
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,120
 So she said she has two questions for Chris and Jason.

560
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,660
 Who is your intended audience for the report and who asked you to write it?

561
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,300
 And she thinks she's answered it herself.

562
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,820
 Quote one, we wrote it for people like us and two, if you were people like us, you would

563
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,020
 know.

564
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:42,460
 And I think that's actually quite a fair criticism of this report that it's quite hard to parse

565
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,940
 if you're not already in the bubble.

566
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:51,500
 I don't know how successful we are at this, but my aim with all of this discussion is

567
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,420
 to bring it to people who are not following it closely.

568
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:02,260
 Because I think that is why we all wanted style to thought in part was to let people

569
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,060
 who are not in the bubble into the bubble.

570
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
 Just wanted to do a podcast.

571
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,300
 I just wanted to make John do all the work.

572
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,300
 Yeah.

573
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,300
 We could have a podcast about board games, guys.

574
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,300
 It'd be way less stressful.

575
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,380
 Oh, there's a thought.

576
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,500
 Where would we get listeners from?

577
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,460
 I think we've become like the Octothorpe podcast network.

578
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,860
 John, if you want to start up a little board game podcast of your own.

579
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,980
 The thing is there is there is one other podcast in the world called Octothorpe, and it is

580
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,460
 a board game podcast.

581
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,660
 Yeah, if we want to do a board gaming podcast, we need to pick a different punctuation mark.

582
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,260
 When we're trying to open the bubble up so that people can see what's inside, we are

583
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,380
 also, I think, trying to do it in a relatively measured way.

584
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,380
 I mean, I do.

585
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,460
 We do know we disagree quite a lot.

586
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,740
 I disagree with that.

587
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,380
 I saw a YouTube video, which we haven't linked to.

588
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,900
 I don't think a couple of YouTube videos about this, which essentially take Abigail

589
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,700
 Nussbaum's very considered report and make it hysterical because that's how you get views

590
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,860
 on YouTube. It's like going, Oh, look, this is a shock and a scandal.

591
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,940
 And of course, this is a shock and a scandal, but I think it makes a lot of sense to try

592
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,700
 to talk about it in a measured way rather than actually I'm over here sharpening my pitchfork

593
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,700
 way.

594
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:23,780
 So so an Ang mentions that in her email using some spicy language.

595
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:29,860
 But yes, I want to sharpen my pitchfork, but I want to do it slowly and menacingly rather

596
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,860
 than quickly and frantically.

597
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,860
 Is that good?

598
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:40,340
 No, but I think I agree with Ang here, which is that the report is important investigative

599
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:46,060
 journalism presented in a very odd way.

600
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,060
 I don't know.

601
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,380
 I found the report itself very hard to read.

602
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,900
 It's kind of a mix of report and editorial in one and I admit I was more into the reporting

603
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,700
 bit than the editorial, but yeah, no, I like the detail.

604
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,020
 I like the detail stats.

605
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,340
 Ang's take on the report is that it's rambling self-indulgent one-sided and agenda-ridden,

606
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:11,780
 which I would not necessarily have used those exact words, but like I think it's difficult

607
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,220
 to criticise it as a take.

608
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,380
 I might say rambly.

609
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,380
 Yeah.

610
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,860
 So Liz, Camestros Felapton released a very, very, very long set of stats of data

611
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,780
 that was like the one that you were talking about doing but didn't do presumably because

612
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,780
 they had done.

613
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:32,580
 No, I didn't do it because I was too lazy.

614
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:36,100
 So thank you to Camestros Felapton and Heather Rose Jones for doing the thing

615
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,460
 I started, but they actually finished it.

616
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,900
 And because it is 48 pages long, I'm very glad I didn't do it.

617
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,540
 My only reservation about this is I just don't know how much of those figures in the Hugo

618
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,620
 stats are now basically made up.

619
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:54,220
 So it could be we've put a lot of time and effort into deep diving into something which

620
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,740
 is just built on a house of cards, but I'm glad it exists.

621
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,420
 And if anyone really wants a deep dive into how you can look at the Hugos and say, "Look,

622
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,220
 this is why these stats look funky."

623
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,260
 If you read it all, you definitely will understand EPH by the end of it as well.

624
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,820
 So give it a go.

625
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,820
 Wahey.

626
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,980
 Given that human lifespans are short.

627
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,660
 Do we really all need to understand EPH?

628
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:23,580
 And I don't have a pick either.

629
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,580
 Sorry.

630
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,580
 I forgot. 

631
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,980
 Liz, you're going first with your pick.

632
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,980
 Pick something.

633
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,980
 Pick something.

634
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,460
 Well hang on, let me look at Goodreads and see what I read.

635
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,460
 I've got a pick.

636
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,460
 I could go first.

637
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,460
 But...

638
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,460
 Why are you making me go first then? 

639
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,460
 You go first then let me look at what box I've read.

640
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,460
 Okay.

641
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:47,020
 We went to see a indie Australian science fiction film called Monolith.

642
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,020
 That sounds good.

643
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,820
 It was good.

644
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:57,700
 It stars Lily Sullivan as a journalist who has been embroiled in a scandal of some description.

645
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,420
 The exact nature of the scandal is not really important.

646
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:07,540
 And she has resorted to podcasting to shore up her struggling career, which is very funny.

647
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,460
 And she starts looking at a story.

648
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,500
 So the podcast she's doing is this conspiracy theory podcast.

649
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,340
 So it is like very much a kind of a cuckus podcast, if you will.

650
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:24,860
 And she gets an email from someone and she starts looking into the subject of their email.

651
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:30,660
 And it's all her on screen and then other people on the other end of phone lines.

652
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,740
 But the entire kind of thing is her in one set.

653
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,100
 I don't think it's perfect.

654
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,340
 I think there are some things it does which it could do better.

655
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,140
 But certainly it was really worth watching.

656
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,380
 Really interesting.

657
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,380
 Very creepy.

658
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,180
 Very much gets the vibe it's going for.

659
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:52,700
 And I thought the ending really enjoyed how the ending kind of lampshades

660
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,380
 the futility of existence?

661
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,540
 Go watch it.

662
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,820
 If you can find it, I have no idea where you can watch it.

663
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,980
 I think you can rent it on places where you can rent movies.

664
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,540
 But I don't think it's streaming for free anywhere.

665
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,540
 Blockbuster?

666
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:13,140
 We, it got a theatrical release for a single week in the States.

667
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,300
 And so we went to see it in the cinema.

668
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,180
 But I don't think it's had a cinema release in the UK at all.

669
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,380
 I think it has stopped playing in the States.

670
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,140
 So yeah, I think it's a rent it at home jobby.

671
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,820
 I'm forced to conclude.

672
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,660
 I'm going to have to start renting some movies to get the ones I want.

673
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,260
 Because a lot of them just never turn up on streaming and they are available for a little.

674
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:40,540
 And also with the amount that we watch movies at home, which is that we go to cinema quite

675
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,540
 a lot.

676
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,180
 So this might not apply to every listener.

677
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,900
 But there's I do sometimes wonder whether it would be cheaper for us just to rent movies

678
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,700
 where we want to rent them than it would be to try and hop around all the streaming

679
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,700
 services.

680
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,380
 Because rentals are usually about three quid.

681
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,300
 And subscribing to a streaming service for a month is more than that.

682
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,420
 So yeah, I'm beginning to wonder whether just yeah, renting them when I want to watch

683
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,860
 them is the way forward.

684
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,860
 Bring back Blockbuster.

685
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,860
 That's what I say.

686
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:09,180
 I have a pick, which is that I had arranged to have lunch with a friend in London on a

687
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,220
 Thursday when I was also going to the pub on Thursday evening.

688
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,060
 And that left me with four hours in the middle of the day.

689
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,900
 And I said friends, what should I do with the four hours in the middle of the day?

690
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:23,860
 And one of the things that Alex Holden said, I think Alex is a listener, was why not go

691
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:29,700
 to Tom Hanks' Moonwalkers at the Lightroom Gallery in Kings Cross.

692
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:35,620
 So Lightroom is a new gallery that is in something called Lewis Cubitt Square, which is kind of

693
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:41,100
 way north of Kings Cross in that bit that used to be a dingy industrial site and is now

694
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,620
 what Steven calls Googletown, a place where rich people hang out.

695
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:52,140
 And this, the gallery is a featureless box onto which things are projected onto the floor

696
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,060
 and walls.

697
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:02,700
 And this is a whole set of information about Apollo, which is not really going to be very

698
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,300
 new to most of the listeners of this podcast.

699
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,780
 And indeed, most of, I knew most of the stuff that was contained in this already.

700
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,140
 And I'd see most of the pictures before, they're not all of them because apparently there are

701
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,900
 10,000 pictures and they've all been remastered for this.

702
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,620
 And they used a very good camera, which you might not have realized because a lot of them

703
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:25,860
 were, a lot of the photographs were reproduced, reproduced in not a very good way in the '60s

704
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,700
 and '70s, but they are in fact very good photos even before they got remastered.

705
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,700
 This is kind of an answer to the question of, well, what happens when you want to do planetarium

706
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:39,300
 shows, but the old planetarium projector is now completely obsolete.

707
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,340
 So you project things onto your planetariums instead, but planetariums are expensive because

708
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,340
 they're domed shapes.

709
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,580
 So why not just project things onto a cube?

710
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:50,380
 And there are a lot of exhibitions like this.

711
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,380
 We all really liked it.

712
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,540
 There were four of us and we were all very moved and thought it was kind of delightful

713
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,140
 and thrilling.

714
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:02,900
 But I have some caveats, which is the full ticket price is £25, which is absolutely outrageous,

715
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,940
 holy goodness gracious.

716
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,980
 We have a art pass, so it was £12.50, which felt fine.

717
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,740
 And there are codes hanging around on the internet that will get it for £19, which is

718
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,460
 only ludicrously extortionate.

719
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,460
 £25 is too much for a one-room video projection.

720
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,700
 And I was like, that's the same cost as Titanic Belfast.

721
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,420
 If you happen to be in Belfast next Easter for some reason, that's also £25, but has

722
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,860
 like multiple rooms of this sort and also many other things going on and an entire ship

723
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,620
 for you to look at, not the Titanic, and costs £25.

724
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:42,420
 So if you're in the mood for some ludicrously overpriced Apollo nostalgia, I thought it

725
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,420
 was pretty good.

726
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:49,940
 Tom Hanks turns out to be a giant space nerd and part of the narration is his story of what

727
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,020
 it was like to be obsessed with Apollo as a child.

728
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:59,420
 So, as certainly the four of us were obsessed with Apollo as children and probably quite

729
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,380
 a lot of you listeners were as well.

730
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,540
 So for that sort of person, I think it probably hits the mark pretty well.

731
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,700
 Don't go at busy times because reviews say it is oversold at busy times and people have

732
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,380
 to sit on the floor, which is no fun if you're the sort of age for people.

733
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,980
 For people who were obsessed with Apollo as small children.

734
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,340
 I realise I have a lovely little anecdote, which is I want to tell you a story about

735
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,940
 my husband, which is he was an obsessed, an Apollo assessed child and he had the prized

736
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:30,540
 possession of an Apollo 11 patch, which was like a really phenomenal souvenir if you lived

737
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,420
 in North Wales in 1969.

738
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,580
 And he got his mother to sew it onto his anorak so that he could wear it to school.

739
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,380
 And so he had an anorak with an Apollo 11 patch on and he hung it up in the cloakroom

740
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:49,220
 and when he went back at break time he discovered he had an anorak with a circle cut out.

741
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,460
 It's a sad story.

742
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,940
 I said they have Apollo 11 patches if you'd like to buy one and he said it would just make

743
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,940
 me sad.

744
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:00,620
 That is, I'm so sorry, that's awful.

745
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,660
 It's one of these conflicting emotions anecdotes, yes.

746
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:10,180
 But what it was like to be a 10 year old in 1969, imagine what it was like to be a 10

747
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,100
 year old in 1969, so that's part of what I liked about the show is it gives you some

748
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,100
 of that feeling.

749
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,900
 I might have to look at it going, it sounds intriguing.

750
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,260
 Liz, do you have a pick?

751
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,940
 I mean I don't have a pick, so...

752
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,940
 Liz?

753
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,620
 I don't want to pick something substandard.

754
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,140
 Sorry, I didn't think about it.

755
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,820
 We'll pick your friendship with me.

756
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,540
 Listeners, you did not see the look on Liz's face when I suggested that.

757
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:39,260
 Look, for picks we like to pick things that listeners can at least experience and I

758
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,780
 mean our listeners can be your friend, but they cannot experience the particular bond

759
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,740
 John and I have.

760
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:50,900
 A bond which, you know, we test on a frequent basis and becomes stronger.

761
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,940
 And that was the Octothorpe podcast.

762
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,260
 And it's goodbye for me.

763
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,820
 It would be goodbye for me if I wasn't laughing quite so hard.

764
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,740
 And it's goodbye for me.

765
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:26,300
 Sorry, is that another cultural reference you guys don't get?

766
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,300
 I got it.

767
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,860
 I was busy texting my wife.

768
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,900
 OK, so John wasn't listening and Liz got the reference, OK?

769
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,900
 Yes.

770
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,220
 Yes, do I need like a hand signal to show I've got your references or something?

771
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,220
 You could laugh.

772
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,220
 I don't know.

773
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,220
 Maybe they're not funny.

774
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,620
 See, now it's really awkward, isn't it?

775
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,380
