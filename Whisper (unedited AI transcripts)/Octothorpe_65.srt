00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,280
 Hello everyone and welcome to a very special bonus episode of Octa Thorpe, the podcast

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,960
 of a science fiction and science fiction fandom. I'm Jon Coxon.

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,840
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,160
 Today we are going to be playing Action Castle 2. We will not be doing any discussion of science

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,000
 fiction which one might reasonably expect us to do in an episode of Octa Thorpe.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,760
 We're going to be playing Action Castle 2. Return to Action Castle, the next step downward

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,920
 to danger.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,160
 I've never been to Action Castle.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,160
 No, so if you would like to listen to some people play through Action Castle 1, then I

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,000
 will put a link in the show notes to a podcast that does that, but Liz and I have already played

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,920
 Action Castle 1, so we're going to be doing Action Castle 2 today. Action Castle 2 is not

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,800
 a beginner level adventure, so it has a little bit more to it and is a little bit more interesting,

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,560
 so that works out well for our listenership.

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,920
 Is it set in the action castle?

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,080
 Action Castle! Castle Castle Castle Castle Castle Castle Castle.

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,760
 Many years have passed since the King of Action Castle was crowned. Now a simple cobbler

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,280
 with dreams of fortune and glory sets out on a grand adventure. Fantasy, intermediate,

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,280
 everyone, 10+ skull.

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,840
 What's the skull mean?

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,160
 Erm, I don't know, it's just a picture of a skull. I think it probably means that they

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,080
 needed a good picture to go next to a boring table and they had a picture of a skull.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,640
 Oh, I thought, does it mean we can die?

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,360
 Are you going to explain the rules to us?

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,720
 Have either of you two ever played one of the old info-com text adventures such as

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,680
 Zork or the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,960
 Does adventure count and colossal cave?

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,280
 Yes, like, I'm not necessarily restricting it to info-com.

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,040
 I've been playing, erm, text adventures since before either of you were bored I think,

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,840
 which is quite a shock, because that's not what normally what I say.

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,640
 I was playing text adventures where they were the only games it was possible to play on

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
 a computer.

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,160
 Yeah, normally you've played things before John was born, but not before I was born,

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,160
 so we're going, you know, wiggly lines long way back in time here.

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,680
 I have played the Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy info-com game for about half an hour until

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,200
 I got stuck and gave up.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,080
 I used to have info-com games within Visi-Cluse where you had a special pen that you could

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
 rub off the answers with.

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,920
 Yep, I got one over there somewhere.

39
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,080
 I can't remember where.

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,880
 If you didn't rub off the answers, they were something second-hand?

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,520
 Er, I just like it.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,520
 So the way this works is that I play the parser, or the computer, and Liz and Alison will take

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,000
 it in turns to give me instructions.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,720
 I will be describing what they see and the outcomes of their decisions and they will be

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,760
 getting themselves into right problems.

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,360
 Or, doing all of the things very efficiently, but let's hope not because that will be very

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,160
 dull for you, the listener.

48
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,640
 Also, they definitely won't be efficient.

49
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,040
 I think you probably need to say that the instructions are quite limited in these games

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,240
 as they normally consist of a verb followed by a noun or a direction.

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
 I think people will pick that up.

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,280
 So, I'm going to start reading and we're going to play.

53
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,400
 "Cobbler's Workshop"

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
 You are in your workshop.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,320
 A pair of velvet slippers is here.

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,560
 A door leads outside.

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 Alison.

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 "Infantry"

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,360
 You have a shiny copper penny.

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
 Liz.

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,080
 Pick up slippers.

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,680
 You pick up the slippers.

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
 Alison.

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,160
 Examine slippers.

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,720
 You see a pair of fine purple velvet slippers fit for a king.

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
 Liz.

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
 Look around.

68
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,480
 You are in your workshop.

69
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,960
 There used to be a pair of velvet slippers here, but you feel them in your pocket.

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
 A door leads outside.

71
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,920
 I forgot there was a door, so.

72
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
 Alison.

73
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,760
 Where slippers?

74
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,000
 The slippers don't fit.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Boo.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Liz.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,320
 Use door.

78
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,960
 What do you want to use the door on?

79
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,680
 This is why I played half an hour of Infocom Games.

80
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,920
 It's over to Alison.

81
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
 Open door.

82
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,400
 You open the door.

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,760
 The door is now open.

84
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
 Liz.

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,880
 Walk through door.

86
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,680
 You try to walk through the door, but it's very solid.

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,000
 You may wish to walk through the wall where the door used to be.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Alison.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,880
 Go outside.

90
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,600
 You are in the town square.

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,320
 It is a dark, cold night.

92
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,480
 Exits lead north, south, east and west.

93
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,400
 You see a wishing well here.

94
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,160
 How did you even know it was outside, outside the door?

95
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
 I don't think John has specified that.

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
 Maybe we've sk-

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,560
 Okay, so it's an Infocom adventure.

98
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,800
 So if you have a door and it leads out, then you could go out.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
 It's a direction.

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,720
 Otherwise, you could kind of do north-east, south, west, up and down in order, but that's

101
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
 quite boring.

102
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,520
 I think it is Liz to go.

103
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,320
 Examine well.

104
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
 Well well.

105
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
 A well.

106
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,040
 It's made of stone and it's made rather well.

107
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
 Alison.

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,080
 Drop penny in well.

109
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,640
 You drop your penny into the well and you hear a faint blink as it hits the bottom.

110
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,120
 There goes your last scent.

111
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
 Now what?

112
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
 Liz.

113
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,520
 Use well.

114
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,400
 What do you want to use the well on?

115
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
 Alison.

116
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,920
 Make wish.

117
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,440
 What would you like to wish for?

118
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
 Liz.

119
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,560
 Wish for infinite money.

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,360
 You screw your face up and wish for infinite money.

121
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,960
 You have a feeling that your bank account now has an infinite amount of money in it.

122
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,240
 Unfortunately, you cannot see a bank.

123
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
 Alison.

124
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,440
 Oh for fuck's sake.

125
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
 So let me guess.

126
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,320
 We now use our last penny and we have also used our last wish, which means we can't wish

127
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,880
 for the obvious thing.

128
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
 Right, anyway.

129
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
 No.

130
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,720
 Maybe we'll get some more money and be able to make another wish.

131
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
 I'm sure it's fine.

132
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,880
 Maybe we got three wishes.

133
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,040
 Um, North.

134
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
 I'm so sorry.

135
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
 Mm-hmm.

136
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
 Cobbler's workshop.

137
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
 You are in your workshop.

138
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,840
 There used to be a pair of velvet slippers here.

139
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
 A door leads outside.

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
 To the south.

141
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
 Liz.

142
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
 Go south.

143
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,480
 You're in the town square.

144
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,200
 It's a dark, cold night.

145
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,360
 Exits lead north-south-eastern-west.

146
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,440
 You see a used wishing well here.

147
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
 Alison.

148
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,160
 Get well.

149
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,640
 Ha ha ha.

150
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,920
 You already feel fine.

151
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
 Thank you.

152
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
 Liz.

153
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
 Wes.

154
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,440
 You are in the town hall.

155
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,120
 Rosemary, the mayor's daughter, is here.

156
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
 Exits lead out.

157
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
 Alison.

158
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,520
 Speak to Rosemary.

159
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,920
 Hey, it's your girlfriend.

160
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,720
 She's a sweet girl, but she's painfully shy.

161
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,240
 Rosemary blushes as she catches you looking at her.

162
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
 Liz.

163
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,320
 Wait, Alison said speak to Rosemary and we just looked at her.

164
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
 Yes, she...

165
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,920
 Yeah, she's painfully shy.

166
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,200
 This is the... there's normally a syntax that's something like "Ask X about Y" or something

167
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
 like that.

168
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
 And normally I was...

169
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,400
 I was expecting by saying speak to Rosemary.

170
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,200
 Normally the parcel responds with the syntax, but I understand the parcel might be a bit

171
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,600
 faulty in this context.

172
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,800
 Ask Rosemary about slippers.

173
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,200
 Rosemary says, "That's a pair of fine purple velvet slippers fit for a king.

174
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,320
 But you're not a king, so why do you have those slippers?"

175
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
 Alison.

176
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,400
 Ask Rosemary about king.

177
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,360
 Rosemary says, "Oh, I don't really follow politics.

178
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
 Liz."

179
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,920
 Ask Rosemary about well.

180
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,760
 Rosemary says, "I made a wish in the wishing well once, but I can't tell you what it was

181
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
 or it won't come true."

182
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
 Alison.

183
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
 Hmm.

184
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
 Kiss Rosemary.

185
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,160
 You should my girlfriend write.

186
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,520
 Yeah, you give Rosemary a lovely kiss on the cheek and she smiles at you lovingly.

187
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
 Liz.

188
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
 You're in the town square.

189
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,920
 It's a dark, cold night.

190
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,680
 Exits Lee, north, south, east and west.

191
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,000
 You see a twice used wishing well here.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Alison.

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 South.

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,280
 You are in the smithy.

195
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,920
 The blacksmith is at the forge hammering on some red hot iron.

196
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,840
 There is a grindstone here.

197
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
 Liz.

198
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,640
 Talk to smithy.

199
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,520
 You talk to the burly bearded smithy.

200
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
 He snorts.

201
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
 What do you want?

202
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
 I'm busy.

203
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
 Alison.

204
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,400
 Exits mythy about well.

205
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,880
 The smith says, "I made a wish in the well once, but I can't tell you what it was or

206
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,120
 it won't come true."

207
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
 Liz.

208
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,920
 Ask smithy about weapons.

209
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:46,660
 The smith says, "Weapons are a genre of objects usually used either for self-defense or to

210
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,640
 perpetuate harm against others."

211
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
 Alison.

212
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
 By sword.

213
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,240
 The smith says, "I don't have any swords."

214
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
 Liz.

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
 By axe.

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
 The smith says, "I don't have any axes."

217
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
 Alison.

218
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,840
 By horseshoes.

219
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,440
 The smith says, "I'm all out of everything."

220
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,520
 The Brexit-related supply shortages are really hitting this village hard.

221
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
 Liz.

222
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,320
 Go outside.

223
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,680
 You are in the town square.

224
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,520
 It's a dark, cold night.

225
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,320
 Exits lead north-south-eastern-west.

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,720
 You see a thrice-used wishing well here.

227
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,920
 Yeah, I wasn't really done with the smithy.

228
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
 I got back to smithy then.

229
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
 I can't.

230
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,720
 And then Liz can take you back out again.

231
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 Yeah, indeed.

232
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
 South.

233
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
 Alright.

234
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
 You were in the smithy.

235
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,360
 The black smith is at the forge, hammering on some red-hot iron.

236
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,160
 There is a grindstone here.

237
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
 Liz.

238
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,880
 Examine grindstone.

239
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,560
 If you would just put your nose to it, you might make something of yourself.

240
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,880
 But for now, you're stuck being a cobbler.

241
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
 Alison.

242
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,480
 Ask smith to make sword.

243
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,800
 The smith says, "Unfortunately, this iron is spoken for.

244
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,240
 But if you bring me things, I can make things out of them."

245
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
 Ah, yep.

246
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
 Liz.

247
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,640
 Are you done with the smith or are we?

248
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,360
 Do you have more smith questions?

249
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,200
 You can't ask that.

250
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,840
 That's contrary to the very tension of the game.

251
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,480
 I thought this was a collaborative game.

252
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
 No.

253
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
 Fiercely competitive.

254
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,840
 Well, except for the scoring and the win condition.

255
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,200
 But like certainly.

256
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
 Fine.

257
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,040
 I had not realised we could score.

258
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,280
 Well you scored together.

259
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
 Wink.

260
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
 Fine.

261
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,800
 Not to ask Alex and any questions, not in game form.

262
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
 Alright.

263
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 Go outside.

264
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
 Town Square.

265
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,320
 It's a dark cold night.

266
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,160
 Exits lead north-south-eastern-west.

267
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,520
 You see a thrice used whistling well here.

268
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
 East.

269
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,040
 That's the only thing that's left right?

270
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
 Yes.

271
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,600
 You're walking down Old Pond Road, a wide cobblestone road that used to be lined with

272
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,840
 rose bushes.

273
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,160
 There is a sign here.

274
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,360
 Old Pond Road runs north to south.

275
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,840
 The town is to the east.

276
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,920
 It's that like Old Town Road.

277
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
 Liz.

278
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,280
 Erm, so I missed that last bit.

279
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,320
 Could you please repeat the description just to me?

280
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,120
 You're walking down Old Pond Road, a wide cobblestone road that used to be lined with

281
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
 rose bushes.

282
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
 There is a sign here.

283
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
 Old Pond Road runs south to north.

284
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
 There is a town to the east.

285
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
 West?

286
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,560
 Oh yes, no, sorry.

287
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,840
 That's a typo.

288
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
 The town is to the west indeed.

289
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,760
 Tabo in the book.

290
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,480
 Examine sign.

291
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,920
 You see a weather-beaten sign that reads, "Please don't pick the roses."

292
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
 Alison.

293
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,640
 Pick roses.

294
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
 There are no roses here.

295
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,280
 All of the rose bushes are gone.

296
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
 Liz.

297
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,720
 Examine cobbles.

298
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:38,040
 The cobbles are weather-beaten and seem to regret the ecological devastation perpetuated

299
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,840
 by people picking roses.

300
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
 Alison.

301
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
 North.

302
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,880
 You arrive at a bend in the road.

303
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
 There is an old tree stump here.

304
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,920
 You see action castle to the east.

305
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
 Liz.

306
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,400
 Examine stump.

307
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,800
 Judging by the size of its stump, this tree must have been enormous.

308
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,200
 You see an axe embedded in the tree stump.

309
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
 Alison.

310
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,680
 Get axe.

311
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,560
 You take the axe from the stump.

312
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,920
 It takes a couple of tugs, but eventually it comes free.

313
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
 Liz.

314
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,800
 I can't remember which directions there are.

315
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 I guess so.

316
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,280
 I better look around.

317
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,360
 You are at a bend in the road.

318
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,120
 There is an old tree stump here.

319
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,400
 You see action castle to the east.

320
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
 Alison.

321
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,320
 Examine axe.

322
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,480
 The axe is doled from frequent use.

323
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
 Liz.

324
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
 Go east.

325
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,800
 Oh god.

326
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,040
 You stand outside the walls of action castle.

327
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,480
 There's a deep moat here.

328
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,400
 The drawbridge is up.

329
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,720
 Exits are to the west and into the moat.

330
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,600
 I'm just having a look around.

331
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,160
 I mean we've got to like, you know, scope things out.

332
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,800
 I'm sorry I don't understand.

333
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,760
 I'm just having a look at a round.

334
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,240
 We just need to, you know, scope things out.

335
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
 Alison.

336
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,640
 West.

337
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,720
 You arrive at a bend in the road.

338
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,480
 There is an old tree stump here.

339
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,400
 It used to have an axe in it.

340
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,920
 You see action castle to the east.

341
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,080
 And there is an exit to the south.

342
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
 Go south.

343
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,160
 You're walking down Old Pond Road.

344
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,600
 A wide cobblestone road that used to be lined with rose bushes.

345
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,320
 There is a sign here.

346
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,200
 Old Pond Road runs north to south.

347
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
 The town is to the west.

348
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
 Alison.

349
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,280
 Ritz, oh no, we know what the sign says.

350
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,760
 We call me, um, west.

351
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,240
 It's a dark, cold night.

352
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
 And you are in the town square.

353
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,600
 You see a thrice used wishing well here.

354
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,040
 Exits lead in every compass direction.

355
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
 Go south.

356
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
 You are in the smithy.

357
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,640
 The blacksmith is at the forge hammering on some red hot iron.

358
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,600
 There is a grindstone here.

359
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
 Alison.

360
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,400
 Ask smith to sharpen axe.

361
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,120
 The smith mutters under his breath and sharpens the axe for you.

362
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,680
 You now have a sharp axe.

363
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
 Liz.

364
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,080
 Go north.

365
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,880
 You are in the town square.

366
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,600
 Exits lead north-south eastern west.

367
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,520
 You see a thrice used wishing well here.

368
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,120
 Exits lead in all compass directions.

369
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
 Alison.

370
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,120
 I would like to go south by south-west please.

371
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,440
 Cause it's a very good festival.

372
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,880
 Uh, you bump into the wall of the smithy.

373
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,520
 The smith yells out of the door.

374
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
 What are you doing?

375
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,840
 I'm working here.

376
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
 Liz.

377
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,360
 Go north-north-east.

378
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,520
 You bump into the walls of your own workshop.

379
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,040
 I didn't mention this when we started, but you haven't had anything to drink.

380
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
 Alison.

381
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
 East.

382
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,680
 You are walking down Old Pond Road, a wide cobblestone road that used to be lined with

383
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,080
 rose bushes.

384
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,840
 It runs north to south and the town is to the west.

385
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,200
 Go south.

386
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
 You stand at the edge of the Old Pond.

387
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,320
 The clear night sky above is full of stars.

388
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,800
 You see a rowboat here.

389
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,520
 A path runs alongside the pond to the north and to the south.

390
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
 Alison.

391
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
 Examine rowboat.

392
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,280
 You see that the boat is in fair condition.

393
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,440
 It contains a blanket.

394
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,740
 Take blanket.

395
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,240
 You take the blanket.

396
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
 Alison.

397
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
 South.

398
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,280
 You are in a hermit's cave.

399
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,920
 An old man sits by the fire outside the cave.

400
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,080
 He is lost in thought and he doesn't appear to notice you.

401
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
 Liz.

402
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,280
 Ask hermit about cave.

403
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,320
 What would you like to know about my cave?

404
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
 Alison.

405
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,040
 Give blanket to hermit.

406
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,480
 The hermit says, "Although I look like I might be cold, I've got my fire and I've got

407
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,040
 my burlap sack and I'm actually quite warm."

408
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,080
 But thank you, Liz.

409
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,440
 Ask hermit about castle.

410
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,280
 The hermit says, "Mmm, the castle.

411
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
 Mmm."

412
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,480
 Is related to the prophecy.

413
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
 Mmm.

414
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,280
 And then goes back to staring into the fire.

415
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
 Alison.

416
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
 Ask hermit about prophecy.

417
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,480
 The hermit turns away from the fire and in tones.

418
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,680
 A champion will arise from humble beginnings to bring peace to the land.

419
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,400
 That'll be us then.

420
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
 Liz.

421
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,960
 Go south.

422
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,840
 You try to enter the cave, but it's too dark and scary in there.

423
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,920
 Also, it smells.

424
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,760
 Exits art to the north.

425
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
 Alison.

426
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,440
 Ask hermit about slippers.

427
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,280
 The hermit says, "Oh, those are a nice pair of velvet slippers fit for a king.

428
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,840
 They're just my size."

429
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
 Liz.

430
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,240
 Ask hermit his name.

431
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,480
 The hermit says, "I used to have a name, but I don't really use it anymore."

432
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,720
 Alison.

433
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
 Give slippers to hermit.

434
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,360
 The hermit accepts your gift and gives you this piece of advice.

435
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,920
 Remember, only a fool desires wealth and power, the wise person has everything they need.

436
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,760
 He taps his head and gives you a sly wink.

437
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,520
 Can I put that in my inventory?

438
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
 Liz.

439
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
 Hahaha.

440
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
 Yes.

441
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,880
 Go north.

442
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,840
 You stand at the edge of the old pond.

443
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,040
 The clear night sky above is full of stars.

444
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,760
 You see a roboat here.

445
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,920
 A path runs alongside the pond to the north and to the south.

446
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
 Alison.

447
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,080
 Get roboat.

448
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,920
 You're trying to pick up the boat, but it won't fit in your pocket.

449
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,600
 It would just be really useful for getting over the boat, just saying.

450
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 Liz.

451
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
 Get in roboat.

452
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,440
 You're now in the roboat.

453
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
 Alison.

454
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,720
 Row across pond.

455
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,000
 I'm not sure where the pond leads.

456
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,840
 Row, row, row, your boat.

457
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,320
 Life is a bird to dream.

458
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,000
 You row out to the middle of the pond.

459
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,360
 It's quiet, peaceful and romantic here.

460
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
 Hahaha.

461
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
 Liz.

462
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,320
 Row the roboat back to shore.

463
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,440
 You row back to the shore and climb out of the boat.

464
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
 You're at the edge of the old pond.

465
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
 Alison.

466
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
 North.

467
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,160
 You are walking down old pond road, a wide cobblestone road that used to be lined with

468
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,640
 rose bushes.

469
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,720
 It runs north to south and the town is to the west.

470
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,520
 Go west.

471
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,160
 You are in the town square.

472
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,400
 It's a dark, cold night.

473
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,880
 Exits lead north-south-eastern west.

474
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
 Alison.

475
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
 West.

476
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
 You are in the town hall.

477
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,000
 Rosemary, your girlfriend, is here.

478
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Liz.

479
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,080
 Ask Rosemary about rowboat.

480
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,160
 Rosemary says, "No, I'm Rosemary.

481
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
 Not a rowboat.

482
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,360
 I know it's confusing.

483
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
 Pay attention."

484
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
 Alison.

485
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,440
 Ask Rosemary to come on a date.

486
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,560
 Rosemary says that she'd love to, but it's too chilly to go outside.

487
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
 Liz.

488
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,040
 Give blanket to Rosemary.

489
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,120
 Rosemary kisses you on the cheek and drapes the blanket over her shoulders.

490
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
 Alison.

491
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,280
 Ask Rosemary to come on a date.

492
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,160
 Rosemary says, "Ooh, I'd love to," and starts to follow you.

493
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,640
 Go outside.

494
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,440
 You are in the town square.

495
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,000
 It's a dark, cold night.

496
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,240
 Exits lead north-south-eastern west.

497
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,000
 There is a wishing well here, but you have Rosemary with you, so all is right with the

498
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 world.

499
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Alison.

500
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 East.

501
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,600
 You're walking down old pond road, a wide cobblestone road that used to be lined with

502
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 rose bushes.

503
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,080
 But who needs roses when Rosemary is with you?

504
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,160
 And all is right with the world.

505
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,660
 Go south.

506
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,200
 You stand at the edge of the old pond.

507
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,960
 The clear night sky above is full of stars that pale into insignificance next to the

508
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,720
 beauty of Rosemary, your girlfriend.

509
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
 Alison.

510
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,160
 Get in boat.

511
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,560
 You get in the boat with Rosemary.

512
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,840
 She says, "Ah, I understand what you mean now."

513
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
 Liz.

514
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,680
 Row, row boat.

515
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,800
 You row the boat into the middle of the pond.

516
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,640
 It's quite peaceful and romantic here.

517
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,440
 You have a lovely time.

518
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,480
 We give you a...

519
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
 Alison.

520
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
 [SIGH]

521
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,400
 Propose to Rosemary.

522
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,280
 Rosemary says, "I don't see a ring."

523
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
 Liz.

524
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,880
 Row, back to shore.

525
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,760
 You row back to shore, feeling slightly rejected at your lack of material possessions.

526
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
 Alison.

527
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
 Damn.

528
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
 Give Rosemary a slight wink.

529
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,760
 I want to do that on the boat, really.

530
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
 Can I go back?

531
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,240
 You give Rosemary a slight wink and she says, "Again, Liz."

532
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,400
 Go north.

533
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,520
 You are walking down old pond road, a wide call of stone road that used to be lined with

534
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,680
 Rose bushes.

535
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,840
 There is the town to the west and the road ones north to south.

536
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
 Alison.

537
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,160
 We've still got Rosemary with us, don't we?

538
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,040
 That sounds like a terrible idea.

539
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
 Yes.

540
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,080
 Rosemary's feeling a bit tired for some reason and she is staying by the row boat.

541
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,760
 That'll be handy when we get the ring.

542
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
 North.

543
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,120
 You arrive at a bend in the road.

544
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,480
 There is an old tree stump here that used to have an axe in it.

545
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,560
 You see action castle to the east and there is an exit to the south.

546
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,560
 Liz.

547
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
 East.

548
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,720
 You stand outside the walls of action castle.

549
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,840
 There is a deep moat here and the drawbridge is up.

550
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,200
 There is an exit to the west, back to the bend in the road.

551
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
 Um, swim moat.

552
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,760
 As you enter the water, a monstrous catfish as big as a horse rears up.

553
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,880
 But you manage to fend it off with your sharp axe.

554
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,240
 Wounded, it sinks once more below the surface of the murky water.

555
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,800
 You are treading water in the moat just within reach of the castle stone walls.

556
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,600
 You don't feel safe here.

557
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
 Liz.

558
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
 Climb walls.

559
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,880
 You try to climb the walls but they're all slippery and you can't really get any purchase.

560
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,440
 Ray bloody purchase.

561
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,280
 I should also note, you've got three safe slots.

562
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,600
 If you like want to save the game, you can.

563
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,320
 I should have mentioned that right at the beginning.

564
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,920
 Luckily you haven't died yet.

565
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
 Alison.

566
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,560
 Yeah, if I could have done that before I used I wish on something non-tangible in this scenario.

567
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,280
 Yeah, but you did that.

568
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,560
 You did that like the fourth move.

569
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
 So like.

570
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,560
 Yeah, I mean, we maybe should have used a safe slot before I gave the slippers away.

571
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,360
 No, it's fine, probably.

572
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,280
 They were just a size.

573
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,960
 I'm a kind person.

574
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
 Right.

575
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
 Not necessary.

576
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
 Um, examine moat.

577
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
 Ah ha.

578
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,760
 Peering closely at the walls.

579
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,440
 Next to the moat, you notice that there is a loose stone in the wall.

580
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
 Liz.

581
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,160
 I mean loose as in like wiggly, not loose as in low sexual mores.

582
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,120
 I am committed to rosemary anyway.

583
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,800
 Um, pull loose stone.

584
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,360
 Pulling with all your might, you move the stone away, revealing a tunnel.

585
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
 Alison.

586
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
 Go tunnel.

587
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,720
 You squeeze through the narrow opening and enter a long dark tunnel.

588
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,440
 You find yourself somewhere underneath the castle.

589
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,440
 A dark tunnel stretches to the north and the south.

590
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,280
 There is a hole dug into the wall to the east and there is a skeleton here.

591
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
 Liz.

592
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
 Examine skeleton.

593
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,600
 You see the skeletal remains of an adventurer clad in fire scorched armour.

594
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,160
 Its rent and battered shield bears the heraldry of action castle.

595
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
 Alison.

596
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,760
 Get shield.

597
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,520
 You pick up the shield.

598
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
 Liz.

599
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,960
 Examine hole.

600
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,000
 You look up the hole back to where the moat was.

601
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,160
 It looks grimy and slimy and you did not enjoy going through it.

602
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
 Alison.

603
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
 East.

604
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,280
 You are in, you are, you are treading water in the moat just within reach of the castle

605
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,120
 stone walls you do not feel safe here.

606
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
 Liz.

607
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,080
 Yeah, if you have a plan I do not know what it is.

608
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
 Alison.

609
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,760
 Yeah, I just don't think the direction is working because I think we want to go back to the

610
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,440
 tree to the top and it is west.

611
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,520
 I can show you that there is a map at the end but um, Liz.

612
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,000
 Climb out of moat.

613
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,400
 You stand outside the walls of action castle.

614
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,280
 There is a deep moat here and the draw ridges up.

615
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,880
 There it exits to the west.

616
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,960
 West.

617
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,520
 You are at our bend in the road.

618
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,240
 There is an old tree stump here.

619
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,160
 You see action castle to the east and there is an exit to the south.

620
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
 Liz.

621
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,560
 Use axe on tree stump.

622
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,080
 You put the axe back in the tree stump.

623
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
 It looks nice.

624
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,280
 It has a sort of rustic aesthetic.

625
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
 Alison.

626
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
 Get it.

627
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,920
 You pick up the axe.

628
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,520
 Fortunately putting it in the tree stump has not doled it.

629
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,120
 Although it has cleaned some of the viscera from the fish off it.

630
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
 Liz.

631
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,040
 Examine shield.

632
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,200
 You examine the shield.

633
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,920
 It is battered but you can just make out the heraldry of action castle.

634
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,960
 You think it might be quite old.

635
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
 South.

636
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,440
 You're walking down old pond road, a wide cobblestone road that used to be lined with

637
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
 rose bushes.

638
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
 There is a sign here.

639
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,520
 The road runs north to south and the town is to the east.

640
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,400
 Sorry, town is to the west.

641
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,960
 Go west?

642
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,720
 You are in the town square.

643
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,440
 It's a dark cold night.

644
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,040
 Exits lead north south eastern west.

645
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,800
 You see a wishing well here.

646
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 Alison.

647
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 South.

648
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,600
 You are in the smithy.

649
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,920
 The black smith is at the forge hammering on some red hot iron.

650
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,800
 There is a groin stone here.

651
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 Liz.

652
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,600
 Save the game.

653
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
 Please hold.

654
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,000
 Game saved.

655
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,320
 Ask smith to mend the shield.

656
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,440
 The smith looks at the shield and says this is in pretty good nick even though it's quite

657
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,680
 old and the heraldry is quite faded.

658
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
 Liz.

659
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,040
 Give shield to smith.

660
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,480
 The smith says I don't really need a shield but thank you for thinking of me.

661
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,080
 If you want to pay for me sharpening your axe I prefer money.

662
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
 Alison.

663
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,120
 I'm moneys at the bottom of the well.

664
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
 Right.

665
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,640
 No it's not my fault.

666
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,000
 We have infinite money if banks existed.

667
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 North.

668
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,320
 You are in the town square.

669
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,640
 You are surrounded by exits and wishing wells of all descriptions.

670
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
 Liz.

671
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,680
 Go east?

672
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,760
 You are walking down old pond road, a wide core stone road that used to be lined with

673
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,120
 rose bushes.

674
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,920
 It runs north to south and the town is to the west.

675
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
 Alison.

676
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
 North.

677
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,280
 You are at our bend in the road.

678
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,560
 There is an old tree stump here and you see action castle to the east.

679
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,120
 Go east?

680
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,040
 You stand outside the walls of action castle.

681
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,840
 There is a deep moat here and the drawbridge is up.

682
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
 Alison.

683
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,360
 East and I'm wondering whether we can actually do a series of directions to make these bits

684
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,800
 where we go back to where we shouldn't have got away from in the first place.

685
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,280
 I could stop reading out quite as most description.

686
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,960
 You are treading water in the moat.

687
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,400
 You don't feel safe here.

688
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,560
 Exit Tarte through the tunnel or back onto the bank of the moat.

689
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
 Liz.

690
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,120
 Go into tunnel.

691
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,840
 You find yourself somewhere underneath the castle.

692
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,840
 A dark tunnel stretches to the north and south and you have just come through a hole that

693
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,920
 leads back to the east.

694
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
 Alison.

695
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
 Eyes blinking.

696
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,040
 You emerge into a large chamber with a high vaulted ceiling.

697
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,960
 A huge dragon is here slumbering atop a pile of glittering treasure.

698
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
 Examine.

699
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
 Tragon.

700
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,320
 You see a huge beast with razor sharp claws and a skelly hide stronger than steel.

701
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,800
 The dragon is lying on a mountain of treasure and snoring loudly.

702
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
 Alison.

703
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
 Get ring.

704
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,120
 No, don't really get ring.

705
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
 It's stupid.

706
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,360
 Examine treasure.

707
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,640
 You see burlap sacks bursting with gold coins.

708
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,720
 The kings ransom of precious gems, rings and jewelry and a gleaming sword forged of the

709
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,240
 finest steel.

710
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
 Liz.

711
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,000
 Shout, hello.

712
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,760
 The dragon wakes up, eyes you hungrily and roars.

713
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,600
 Another mortal dares challenge me.

714
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 Choose a weapon.

715
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,560
 Wits or steel.

716
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
 Alison.

717
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
 Noth.

718
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,720
 You managed to escape to the north.

719
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:02,520
 The dragon pursues you with fire but doesn't quite manage to get you as you escape.

720
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,920
 There's no way that dragon get headed to the tunnel.

721
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,080
 You find yourself somewhere underneath the castle.

722
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,840
 A dark tunnel stretches to the north and other south.

723
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
 Alison.

724
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,400
 Go north.

725
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,640
 You are in the dungeon.

726
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,200
 Tortures flicker higher above, casting sinister shadows on the walls.

727
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,480
 A twisting staircase leads up.

728
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,280
 There are some cells here.

729
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
 Alison.

730
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,720
 Examine cells.

731
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,040
 You see a series of lines scratched into the wall.

732
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,360
 They look like someone was here for a long time.

733
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,960
 There's a whole dug into one of the cells walls.

734
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,320
 And that hole goes to the south.

735
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,240
 Go through whole.

736
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,360
 You find yourself somewhere underneath the castle.

737
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,000
 A dark tunnel stretches to the north and south.

738
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,160
 There's a whole dug into the wall to the east.

739
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
 Alison.

740
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
 North.

741
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,080
 We just came back the way we came, didn't we?

742
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,320
 You are in the dungeon.

743
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,920
 Tortures flicker higher above.

744
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,000
 Her twisting staircase leads up.

745
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,320
 Go up.

746
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,560
 You are on the dungeon stairs.

747
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,600
 From above you can make out some of the king's guards talking about current events.

748
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,840
 Someone has left an old lamp here.

749
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
 Alison.

750
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
 Get lamp.

751
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,600
 You get the lamp.

752
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,080
 Liz.

753
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,680
 Go up.

754
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,160
 You are in the courtyard.

755
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,240
 There is a pair of guards here.

756
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,520
 They yell, "Holt!

757
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,760
 Who goes there?"

758
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,040
 The guards grab you by the arms.

759
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,840
 You are arrested for trespassing and locked in the dungeon.

760
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,840
 This is where you remain for the rest of your miserable days.

761
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
 The end.

762
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,040
 Thank you for playing.

763
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,040
 Load.

764
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,320
 Loading safe slot one.

765
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,000
 Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop

766
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,760
 bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop.

767
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
 You are in the smithy.

768
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,920
 We do we have a sharp hat?

769
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,320
 Do you want your inventory?

770
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,080
 Um inventory, yeah.

771
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,120
 You have a sharp axe, a shield and a sly wink.

772
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
 Liz.

773
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,000
 Ask blacksmith to make ring.

774
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,800
 The blacksmith says, "Um, more about your sword's shield's axes and the like.

775
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,320
 Rings are more of a jeweler's business."

776
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
 Alison.

777
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,680
 Plenty of rings underneath the dragon.

778
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
 Right.

779
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
 Okay.

780
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,920
 North.

781
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,080
 You are in the town square.

782
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,160
 East.

783
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,880
 You are at the old pond road.

784
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,120
 North.

785
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,400
 You are at a bend in the road.

786
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,040
 Can we ask you a question for a digital question?

787
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,640
 Can we keep going back the same saves not every time we die?

788
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
 Yep.

789
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,880
 Save again before we get to see the dragon.

790
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
 East.

791
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,720
 You stand outside the walls of action castle.

792
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
 Alison.

793
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 East.

794
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,000
 You are treading water in the moat.

795
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Liz.

796
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,840
 Go through whole.

797
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,440
 You find yourself somewhere underneath the castle.

798
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
 Alison.

799
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
 Save.

800
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
 Saving the game.

801
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:51,520
 P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P! Game saved. Lizz.

802
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
 Go South!

803
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,440
 I's blinking, you emerge into a large chamber with a high-vaulted ceiling. A HUGE Draagen

804
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,300
 is here, slumbering atop a pile of glittering treasure. Allison...

805
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,800
 Um, take ring.

806
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:11,120
 As you try to take the ring, you wake the dragon. He roars, you dare steal!

807
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,160
 From my horde! And he flames you up real good.

808
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,080
 The End.

809
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,320
 Thank you for playing Action Castle.

810
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
 Lizz.

811
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,800
 Load save slot 2.

812
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,920
 You find yourself somewhere underneath the castle. Allison.

813
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
 South!

814
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,800
 Eyes blinking, you emerge into a large chamber with a high-vaulted ceiling. A huge dragon

815
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,240
 is here, slumbering atop a pile of glittering treasure. Lizz.

816
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,440
 Shout! Wake up!

817
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,080
 The dragon wakes up, eyes you hungrily and roars. Another mortal dares challenge me.

818
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,360
 Choose a weapon. Wits or steal.

819
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,840
 Allison.

820
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,120
 Wits!

821
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,000
 Excellent! Answer my riddle correctly or be burned alive and eaten.

822
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,960
 Are you ready? Lizz.

823
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,000
 Say yes.

824
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,720
 Who owns nothing yet has everything.

825
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
 Allison.

826
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,760
 The wise man isn't it. The wise man.

827
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,280
 The dragon laughs.

828
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,040
 Well done, you succeeded where all others failed. Now choose your reward. The dragon gestures

829
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,720
 to the gold coins, the gleaming sword and the diamond ring.

830
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,080
 Take diamond ring.

831
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,280
 A human who loves pretty rocks, roars the dragon.

832
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,160
 Typical. With a sweep of its tail, the dragon opens a chute beneath your feet and you tumble

833
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,920
 down into the darkness. You have a ring.

834
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
 Wuh-hey!

835
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,480
 You are outside a dark cave.

836
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:45,480
 There is the ashes of a fire here and there are footprints of slippers leading away from

837
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,560
 the fire into the cave.

838
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
 Allison.

839
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,160
 Get ashes.

840
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:55,360
 Um, unfortunately in this game English people cannot get the ashes.

841
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
 Lizz.

842
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,960
 Didn't try to win them.

843
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,640
 Um, going off?

844
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,680
 You stand at the edge of the old pond. The clear night sky above is full of stars. You

845
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,760
 see a rowboat here. Rosemary is sleeping under a blanket.

846
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
 Allison.

847
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,080
 Give Rosemary a sly week and a ring.

848
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,520
 You wake Rosemary, get into the boat and row to the middle of the lake where you give

849
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,800
 the ring to Rosemary. Your beloved kisses you on the cheek, exclaiming, "Of course

850
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,760
 I'll marry you." The two of you return to her town and live happily ever after.

851
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
 The end.

852
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,800
 Thank you for playing Action Castle.

853
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,720
 Your score is some.

854
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,960
 What do we get scores for? Tell us when we get points.

855
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,920
 Uh, yes, you have. Let me just count.

856
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:58,440
 You visited 12 locations so you got 24 points for that. You made a wish in the wishing well,

857
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,840
 which is 3 points. Giving you 27 points. You gave the blanket to Rosemary, which is 37

858
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,120
 points. You gave the sippers to the hermit, which is 47 points. You defeated the catfish,

859
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,120
 which is 57 points. You answered the redo, which is 67 points. And you proposed, which

860
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:18,040
 is 87 points out of 100. Pretty good. Pretty good score.

861
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,280
 All done, peeps.

862
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,480
 At this point we spoil the rest of the game. These are one shots, right?

863
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,800
 We're done yet.

864
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,000
 So we are going to spoil the rest of the game now for fun. Could we have gone back into

865
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,800
 the cave to find out what was happening to the...

866
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,400
 No, because it was dark and scary and it smelled.

867
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,480
 But we have a lamp. No, we don't. No, we don't have a lamp, but we could get a lamp.

868
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,680
 You could have gone and got on a lamp. The lamp doesn't do anything. The lamp is a reference

869
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,600
 to the first game. You get a lamp in the first game and it's really, really useful. And without

870
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,640
 it, you can't complete it. In this one, the lamp does nothing and is completely useless.

871
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,960
 Also, the reason that there are Rose bushes that have gone in this one is because you pick

872
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,640
 a rose in the last one. So you were the one that started the craze that destroyed all

873
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,120
 the rose bushes. You scallywag.

874
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,080
 Basically, there are two wind conditions in this game. You can either ask the dragon.

875
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,480
 There are three options for the... I'll get in the dragon. If you choose gold, the dragon

876
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,120
 gives you as much gold as you can carry and then jessens into the moat where you drown.

877
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:25,520
 So that's fun. If you choose the sword, you go back... You can go back into the tunnels

878
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,660
 with the sword and the dragon just goes back to sleep. And if you choose the ring, he jessens

879
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,800
 you from the chamber with the ring. And so if you choose the ring, you can go and propose

880
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,320
 to Rosemary and live happy ever after. But if you choose the sword, you can basically

881
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,080
 the... If you go to the courtyard with the sword, the guards see that you've got the sword and

882
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,480
 then take you to see the king. And yeah, and then you go and meet the king.

883
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,160
 Presumably if we'd had the slippers, we'd meet the king. We could have given the king

884
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,600
 the slippers. If you go and see the king, the player, when you go into the throne room,

885
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,160
 the king is wearing the slippers because you've given the slippers to the hermit. Because

886
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,320
 it was the king that told you the answer to the riddle. Disguise the hermit. Disguise

887
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,600
 the hermit. But we never knew that. You didn't know that. Well, because it kind of... You

888
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,880
 either do the heroic version or you do the romantic version, but I quite like that there

889
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,600
 are two ways to do it. Yeah, but you can't do both. So you can't like...

890
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,680
 No, you can either be career focused or family focused. None of this double dipping.

891
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:33,360
 Okay, so can you kill the dragon with your axe and shield? No, can't kill the dragon.

892
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,560
 So if you choose steel, you will always lose, basically. Yeah, if you choose steel, you

893
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:43,760
 fight a dragon and the dragon will eat you. Just it's a dragon and you're a cobbler.

894
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,000
 Yeah, fair point. And that's how that works. Yeah, you killed her. You severely wounded

895
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,080
 a catfish. I will say I slightly screwed up the directions in and out of the moat. You

896
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,640
 were right. The reason it was confusing was entirely by fault and it's not reflective

897
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,760
 on the game, but I thought once I'd done it, I should probably keep going with the wrong

898
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,800
 version rather than confusing everything by retconning halfway through. And also the game

899
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,320
 does give instructions. The love interest can either be Rosemary, your girlfriend or

900
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,000
 Sage, your boyfriend. So you can date a girl or a boy. Unfortunately, no options for

901
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,440
 envy characters, but you know, baby steps. Why are we not girls? You are girls. Ah, but

902
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,840
 we were we were we're romancing. Oh, we're girls. Okay, cool. But we're romancing a girl

903
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,240
 anyway. Yeah, we're girls. So romance throws me the lady. Yeah, we are. Okay, I'm just

904
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,120
 drawing two skirts on my stick figures in my picture. And that is feminism. Yeah, I didn't

905
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:55,800
 draw any skirts. Oh, you can see the shoe. I don't want to do that. Yes, send me both

906
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:03,320
 your maps. Okay, so I am now going to put drawing drawing game maps as another what another

907
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,400
 thing in the list of things that I've had so much better for than pencil and paper. It

908
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,160
 turns out, I mean, that's not not untrue. I've never done it before. It definitely true in

909
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,920
 that it's every true in that I drew the town hall above the club of shop. And then you said,

910
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,760
 Oh, no way, it's the other way around. And so that's why there's some funny arrows. But

911
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,880
 I feel mine is quite good. You like my little dragon? I love you a little dragon, actually.

912
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,960
 I have a dragon. I also have a little dragon. Oh, let's see Alison's little dragon. Oh,

913
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,520
 yeah, premium, excellent stuff. But I mean, that's the first time I think I've drawn an

914
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:41,360
 adventure game map on on the iPad, but it will not be the last thing. Yeah, that's it.

915
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,360
 Never doing it on. I feel mine has got some colorful detail like I drew a little rowboat

916
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,840
 and also I checked our saves lots and so on. And there's also, I think when Alison went

917
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,600
 south, southwest, I thought I need to go north, northeast in order to get back to where we

918
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,280
 were. I hadn't realized that basically she hadn't moved. Yeah, no, that's a that's a

919
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,200
 info com thing. Yeah, it was. I now you've said it. That's very obvious. Did not at all

920
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,760
 occur to me in the moment. So sorry. Yeah, but that's is another thing that you learned

921
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,960
 by playing too many info com games, which I really, really have. But all the very long

922
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,200
 time ago, it does also occur to me that there is no reason why the three of us couldn't play

923
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,080
 one of the actual info com games taking it in turns to input commands. And that would

924
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,040
 be absolute chaos. It would be chaos. But I think also, I mean, it was quite fun, actually,

925
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,200
 but I don't make an episode because I think partially designed to be quite a lot faster

926
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,760
 than doing this with a real game. The info com games are quite long. I mean, the early

927
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,960
 ones aren't, but the ones you get to things like a mine forever voyaging, they're massive.

928
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,360
 Yep. But if we were going to do that, have you two played leather goddess as a phobos?

929
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,240
 No, no, why I know it's a classic. It is classic, but it's also classically terrible.

930
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,240
 So, you know, good, good mix. That was the old thought podcast. And it's goodbye from

931
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:04,240
 me. It's goodbye from me. And it's goodbye from me.

932
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:25,080
 It's funny enough. Was that not funny enough?

933
