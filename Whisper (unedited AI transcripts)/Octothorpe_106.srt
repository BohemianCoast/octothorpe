1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
 Ah yeah, we've got an awards bit, yeah, because of course we do, yes.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,280
 There's always an awards bit.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:22,960
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 106th episode of Octa Thorpe, the podcast for

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,560
 Science Fiction and Science Fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 28th of March 2024,

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,720
 or Maunday Thursday. I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,360
 And hello to everyone who's listening to this on the way to EasterCon. We hope your car/plane/rail

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,960
 replacement bus is pleasant. I think there might actually be some trains. If you're listening from

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,000
 a train, do let us know. There might be some trains in the kind of phase where you can still get a

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,760
 train before you get to the rail replacement bus. Let us know listeners. If you are delayed by 30 or

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,040
 more minutes, you can claim delay repay and then you can spend it on board games. Board games,

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,120
 better than delays. You know what else is better than delays? Letters of comment.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,080
 And we have some letters of comment. So we heard from Bob Morrell on Blue Sky,

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,280
 who very much enjoyed the artwork on episodes 103 and 102, which is the ones about wearing your

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,160
 different Hugo hats and David McArty in a pander suit. So I think they are some of our finest art.

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,320
 Thank you very much Bob Adlers. Tom Roch. We heard from Colin Murtar who wrote into comments,

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,080
 "If part of your aim is to explain what's going on in the bubble, I would say you manage that with

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,480
 a plomb. I'm not in the fandom, but between you and Fals

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,720
 7.8, I get clear and concise explanations of what's been going on. So for that, thanks."

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,720
 Hoorah! We're being helpful guys. Yes. I will say Colin, if you stop knowing what we're going on

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,400
 about, please let us know because I do sometimes worry that we'll stop being good at it. We heard,

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,240
 and this is going to come as a surprise from Chris Garcia who said, "There's a photo of a friend of

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,800
 Mylo on your cover art." Well, it obviously was because it was this, right? Maybe not a friend,

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,640
 but I got to interview Margaret Hout and advocated her for the Computer History Museum Fellowship.

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,600
 So I feel like this is more evidence that Chris Garcia is better at name-dropping than most of the

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,320
 rest of us. And it's always really cool name-dropping. It's not like, you know, I ran into such a body

26
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,640
 on a train station platform and said hello. It's like, "Oh no, they were in my car along with the

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:32,640
 lunar lander." And he also says, "I have listened to OctaThorp on a 20th anniversary Mac, the best

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,560
 Mac ever made." And I know that nobody else cares about this, but that gave me a warm feeling.

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,200
 Thank you. I'm very glad to know that OctaThorp has been heard on that device.

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,560
 He does end the lair by saying, "Friendship is the greatest pick of all." So that's good.

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:03:00,240
 Alison, I have an art prompt for you. Can you draw us as my little OctaThorp friendship is magic?

32
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:09,280
 Oh yeah, no, I think that's that's doable. Chris also says, "The NPC's censure is the

33
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,840
 closest we've got to any group officially condemning the actions of Chengdu. Pretty much

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,560
 James and Mary Robinette are the only two former chairs who haven't read the type seen."

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,480
 And that's a good point I think. And also, I feel like, can we formally condemn the actions of Chengdu

36
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,000
 guys? I mean, I think we were formally condemning the actions of Chengdu before it was cool.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,680
 We haven't been using the Chengdu as a shower artwork enough in the wake of all of this, and maybe we

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,520
 should maybe we should dig that out and we should probably get it on t-shirts. Well, it seems to

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,440
 have come down a bit, but I think there will be a point where, for instance, the 2024 Hugo winners

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,160
 have a Hugo in the 2022-2023 winners do not have a physical Hugo that maybe we can drag out again?

41
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,440
 I believe they're still a Dave McCarty's lock-up, aren't they?

42
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,800
 Laurie Anderson of the Hugo Girl Podcasts has taken matters into her own hands and made adorable

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,040
 little tiny awards for people. They are extremely cute and we apparently are going to get some

44
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,480
 at Glasgow. We're very excited. Yeah, we're very excited about this.

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:22,160
 So yes. And then we also heard from Mike Glier of 5.7.17, among other pursuits. Every episode,

46
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,120
 I send an email to Mike and Bill Burns to get our episode on 5.7.70 and efranzines.com. And this

47
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,920
 time I noted more explicitly that there's a transcript of the episode, and Mike, he might

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,960
 have actually a transcript, "Blessings upon you all. I've stopped everything and read it." Which is

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,280
 high praise. And he wanted to discuss the thing that, um, Alison said, "People reside above you

50
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,120
 as things go terribly wrong, and then suddenly you'll be working on the world colour, a high level."

51
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
 And Mike says, "That's a fact, and it's less fun now than it used to be, because I remember

52
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
 Anita Raj at the 1989 Worldcon Family Gathering, or whatever it was actually called."

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,000
 Speaking about how she'd come to volunteer at Norie's Con 3. The sport life found the last

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,680
 speaker in the centre, IEL, diminutive Anita Raj who told her story. "This is my first

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,920
 Worldcon. A month ago I was a simple mundane and wandered into a work session for the convention.

56
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,760
 She collated, stapled, mailed, and round up with a radio and a beeper in charge of a gang of

57
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,920
 teamsters during setup. Don't even try, because you can't get rid of me now." Yeah.

58
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,480
 Um, which is brilliant. Thank you for your much, Mike. That was good.

59
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,520
 So Mike mentions transcripts, and we've, we've, we wanted to transcript for a while, but we had a

60
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,000
 problem, which is that we felt that AI transcripts are, are, were not good enough. And hand transcribing

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
 is more work than you think it is. If you, if you've not tried it and you don't think it's a lot of

62
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,520
 work, you should try it and then you can think it's a lot of work. So we've done a few, but we

63
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,400
 haven't done very many. And so we now, we have a better AI transcript, which we will release with

64
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,720
 the episode on the day of the, we drop it. But we're going to then, over the next week, improve

65
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,840
 it quite a lot. We'll correct all the obvious errors, but it won't be kind of what I think

66
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,120
 offers a Clare Broily standard of correction. It will be a kind of us standard of correction,

67
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,240
 which is definitely not as good as that. More about that later. And, um, and you should get that,

68
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,320
 the following week is the plan. So we'll have a links on our show notes to where you can get the

69
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,040
 transcript files. And, and what we'd like you to do is you probably have friends who

70
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,480
 have hearing loss, who aren't listening to the podcast, because they can't hear it properly.

71
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,400
 And what we want you to do is let them know that we have transcripts available. Yes.

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,240
 The other thing we would like you to do is if you notice a problem with a transcript,

73
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,720
 let us know. There is a link in the show notes to the GitHub repository with the transcripts,

74
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,480
 and you can browse them there. So if you notice any errors, let us know either by email or by

75
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,200
 launching an issue on GitHub if you are conversant with the forms.

76
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,120
 If you are a proper nerd, so one of the things I have done in the last two weeks is start to

77
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,040
 understand how GitHub works. Not very well. If you're proper nerd, you can correct it and just

78
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,720
 send in a pull request and Donald merge it back in. So yeah, if you do that, you will get a ribbon.

79
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,480
 Although if you're, if it in my experience, you can send John a pull request and then he'll

80
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,680
 send you a load of queries about why your pull request isn't good enough. Just say it.

81
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,560
 It is possible that that's more applicable to co-hosts than it is listeners.

82
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:28,720
 And we also heard from some people on Facebook, we heard from Farah Mendelssohn and Alex Holden and

83
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
 Johnny Badley and and Rosin. Thank you very much all for writing in.

84
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,840
 Deb Geisler, who was the chair of Noris Khan for, which was the Worldcon in 2004

85
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:51,120
 and was generally a very good egg. It was announced she had died yesterday as we record.

86
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,680
 None of us knew Deb super well, but she helped out on Lunkon a lot. So we all got to know her

87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,120
 through that and she was an absolutely wonderful person and she will be sorely missed.

88
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
 Yeah, she was very supportive of many of my kind of fan,

89
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,200
 vanish and corollary endeavors and I, this is a great shape.

90
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:22,640
 Who wants to introduce Eastercom? I joined the Eastercom. What? Let's join the Eastercom.

91
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,960
 But last year this was like a nice and exciting surprise that it also put to plane ticket,

92
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,280
 but this time I just bought a virtual membership. So that's fair and you're not going to be as

93
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,320
 stuntless. So philosophical question, can I be a stuntless? You can be anything you want to be

94
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,160
 Liz. Don't let imposter syndrome stop you. It would be quite funny. Will I be able to see your face at

95
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,840
 any point during the weekend? I would virtually, I would virtually present at the Eastercom and

96
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,400
 you might possibly be able to see my face if I join like a Zoom party or something, but I'm not

97
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,760
 time shifting. So I've got to get up early to your face. Only if we could zoom you into breakfast.

98
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,800
 You could zoom me into breakfast. Yes. Oh, whatever. Do you know if there are any greasy

99
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,160
 spoons with good breakfast in Telfer? So the thing about this Eastercom is that it's being held

100
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,920
 in a conference center with a number of on site hotels and then a number of other hotels and I

101
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,720
 am in one of the other hotels and I think John and a Spaniard are also in one of the other hotels.

102
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,600
 Yep, it's got pool. That's quite nice. And what that means is that I won't just be kind of wandering

103
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,080
 down to breakfast in the Con Hotel and then at quarter to ten for my ten o'clock thing. I'll have to

104
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,480
 actually get up and plan. So I was hoping that there are some good cafes in Telfer. So if you

105
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,120
 know of any, do let me know. I know it's like Vlogy Thursday when you're listening to this.

106
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,840
 And it also means that the conference said to shut the type of leave 10 30 in the evenings.

107
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,880
 And after that, there will be a late bar in the holiday inn. But you will only be able to buy drinks

108
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,160
 at the late bar if you are staying in the holiday inn or the other, the international. Is it the

109
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,240
 international? The international is the other official Con Hotel and I am not an either of those

110
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,840
 two hotels on account of how I'm a cheapskate. I'm either going to spend Eastcon super sober

111
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,880
 or have a sack full of tins with me. One of those. Or if you are staying in the holiday inn

112
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,960
 right in because we will trade ribbons for beer. Oh yeah, no, also you can buy me

113
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,200
 you can buy me a beer in exchange for an octa thought ribbon or indeed a cafe moose ribbon because

114
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,640
 I'll have cafe moose if you're only if you're a mooseter for the cafe moose ribbons. But there'll

115
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,000
 be a cafe moose meetup at Eastcon as well. We just don't know where and when yet. This is a

116
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,640
 spectacular deal because I bet the the beers in the holiday and are not cheap. I think you can feel

117
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,520
 free to demand some actual cash off my co-hosts. Not that anyone has cash anymore.

118
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:04,800
 Let's stop ruining our elaborate plan to get cheap beer. Okay, so so one of the things about

119
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,400
 this is that during lockdown about 600 of you said to me, oh, I'll buy you a drink when all this is

120
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,320
 over. And what you don't realize is I was taking names. There is a statue of limitations on offers

121
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:26,480
 of drink. I think it may have expired. I think it might have done. No, that's fine. Yes, we would

122
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,720
 like you to go to the bar for us with our credit cards. Yes. And and and and make sure that we

123
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,600
 could drink. But also the only the only thing that I recognize as beer in the in the late bar is

124
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,560
 Camden IPA. So I might have a bag of tins anyway, just saying. So yes, I mean, so having

125
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,520
 having been someone who has stayed off site at previous Eastcon's, this is

126
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:59,520
 this is not the first time that there have been late night things where you have to find someone

127
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,280
 who was in the right hotel to get them to buy you a drink. And also there have been times when I've

128
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,640
 been staying in the right hotel and I've still wanted to find someone who was staying in the right

129
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,360
 hotels by me a drink on account of how I used to be an undergraduate. So thank you very much for

130
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,720
 tobs buying me drinks when I was on the graduate. This is very good. And any rumors that I learned

131
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,240
 how to forge his signature so I could charge things to the room are entirely unfounded. Oh, that sounds

132
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,000
 so plausible. Maybe I've found it but it's very plausible. We are not staying in the holiday

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,720
 and but I will be in the bar probably. I'll also be in the games room. We'll talk about the games

134
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,680
 room in a minute. And Liz will be in her house. I will be in my house with tins. Maybe with tins.

135
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,480
 It's just I'll be no wait. I'm going to be very confused as well. I'm going to be because I will

136
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,520
 be a varying number of hours ahead depending what day and time of day it is because the clock's

137
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,920
 go forward, right? Yes. The clock's go forward on the Saturday night of Eastcon.

138
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,560
 Yeah, that's going to be confusing. So I mean I think this is just a ploy for a

139
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,600
 fitter happier healthier Eastcon because I also noticed there's a great big park next to the

140
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,920
 conference center which looks very nice actually. There's a great big park. Everyone's going to go

141
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,080
 to bed at 10.30 and you're not all going to be having breakfast together in one giant room full

142
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,360
 of plague. So yeah, I think everyone's going to come out healthier from this one than from previous

143
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,720
 Easticons. Okay, so based on the last two Easticons, I hardly see how I could come out less healthy.

144
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,520
 Oh no, that's tempting fate, isn't it? They'll be a sweepstake listeners. Look at the show notes

145
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,880
 for a link to that. I will not be joining you for breakfast in a cafe, Alison, because I will

146
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,920
 have a breakfast in my hotel which has breakfast included. And I'm hoping it will have mushrooms

147
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,960
 and hash browns. Those are both healthy right liz. Those are vegetables. Absolutely. Good. Good.

148
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,680
 Good. Good. Good. Good. I have also been looking to see if there are any interesting breweries

149
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,760
 around Telford and I am not seeing many and I have had this similar look around

150
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,040
 Shrewsbury when I've been visiting with friends and also been similarly rather disappointed.

151
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,920
 So if you know of any local beers that I should be trying to obtain while I'm there, please let me

152
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,520
 know. So here's what I'm doing at Easticon because although the program has not been released yet,

153
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,480
 apparently we believe by the time this drops, the program will have been published. But we are

154
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,640
 using a little known secret method which is called guessing the URL that the Easticon program will

155
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,040
 probably have to see if we can find it before it's out. And we have listeners, so we're going to

156
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,920
 discuss it now with a proviso that it might change. But the program will obviously be out by

157
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,600
 the time you get this, which is early on Maundi Thursday because no, it will be. I'm

158
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,000
 paying up fairly. It normally is, isn't it? So here's what I'm doing. I'm on a panel about

159
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,640
 starting a skill from scratch. The moderator wrote to me and said, "Tell us which skill you

160
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,440
 started from scratch." And I'm like, "Oh, there's so many because for people who don't know,

161
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,880
 I randomly pick a hobby and then do it obsessively for a while and then stop and do a different one."

162
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,960
 So I have quite a lot of things to say about that. And then I'm on an item at eight o'clock

163
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:19,360
 of Friday called Talking About Tabletop Games, I think possibly with John. Me, yes, with me.

164
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,840
 So this is a panel I suggested and you can come along to hear why I suggested it and what I think

165
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,000
 about it because there is a real danger that if I talk about it here, there will be no point in

166
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,880
 having the panel. Fair. There's a fan fund item at 11 o'clock on Saturday called Around the World

167
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,600
 in 80 Trip Reports, to where I'm talking about the fan funds and about trip reports probably.

168
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,960
 And then there is a fan funds auction, which you should all come. It brings us stuff, but actually

169
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,120
 let us know as soon as possible if you have fabulous things for us to auction because we're

170
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,680
 going to have a catalogue as we have done for the last couple of times. So if you bring us things

171
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,800
 at later in the weekend and say, "Can you auction this?" we'll be like, "Oh, we definitely can,

172
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:15,120
 but possibly at Glasgow." So. And then on Monday at one o'clock we have OctaThorp live in what is

173
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,000
 becoming our standard slot. Yes, because it means that, you know, we can talk about the Eastercon

174
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,680
 at the Eastercon. And Liz will be, I believe, in the audience for this. That is my plan.

175
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:38,480
 Yeah, and we will have a special stunt Liz. So yes, I have a schedule. And my schedule is, as

176
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,560
 Alison mentioned, I am on talking about tabletop games at 8pm on Friday. I am on fan funds auction

177
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,920
 at 8pm on Sunday and I am on OctaThorp live at 1pm on Monday. So I'll see some of you there,

178
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:58,080
 I'm sure. But I am also on on the Friday at four o'clock, a panel on Andor, the Star Wars

179
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:07,520
 television program called Spies Savaters, Assassins. And I think that is going to be a good panel.

180
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,920
 I think it's being moderated by Tommy Ferguson, who is the chair of the next Eastercon and has

181
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:21,200
 some good people on it and should be a good hoot. I am also on a panel at 10am on Saturday called

182
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:29,360
 The Threat and Promise of Mega Constellations. I will be on the promise side of the panel argument

183
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,360
 and I suspect I will be very lonely. I don't know what a mega constellation is. That's why you

184
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,240
 should go to the panel. Constellations with lots of satellites in is what a mega constellation is.

185
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,480
 But I promised to go into that in more detail on the panel. Oh, so it's not like a lot of stars.

186
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,160
 I was like, oh, it's going to be a lot of stars. So this is like space. This is like endlessly

187
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,160
 or anything space junk. Well, that if you take the threat side, yes. Of when have I ever done that,

188
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,800
 John? My career has largely been based on analyzing data from mega constellation. So,

189
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,560
 and I believe that is being moderated by Jackie Burns, who is the guest of honour,

190
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,600
 who's also very kindly supplied an art for the newsletter, which I'm running. If you would like

191
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,800
 to help with the newsletter, please come and help. Alison, I believe is helping with newsletter.

192
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,840
 Yeah, 100%. And are you volunteering with anything else at Eastcon, Alison? Or is it?

193
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:31,520
 It's you and fanfons, I think. Ah, fair enough. The other thing that is happening at Eastcon

194
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,920
 is there will be, well, lots of things happening Eastcon. Yes, many other things are happening

195
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:43,120
 at Eastcon. One of the things in which I am interested is games. Games. So I'll be bringing

196
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,600
 some games. Games. I'll be bringing Atma, a role-playing card game by the people who made

197
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,480
 Shipwreck Arcana, which Liz introduced me to, a boil back. Well, that's my good of a bringing.

198
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,400
 I will be bringing back to the future of the card game. I will be bringing Cthulhu and

199
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,280
 Pirate Flux. I will be bringing Hanabi, and I will be bringing the noisy person's card game.

200
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,920
 So yes, if you'd like to play some games, do let me know. And I see Tim Kirk is bringing

201
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,440
 Blood on the Clock Tower, and I'm hoping that I'll be able to play a couple of games off that,

202
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,000
 because I love Blood on the Clock Tower. So yeah, I'll be good. There is a spreadsheet,

203
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,560
 which I will link in the show notes, which you can peruse that has some games on it.

204
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,360
 Yeah, I mean, you can look at the list of games I have on board game geek, and if there's any

205
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,360
 you want to play, tell me, oh, before this podcast comes out. So that won't work. And then I can

206
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,520
 pack them. Yes, that's your problem. Please go back in time and tell Alison so that she can pack

207
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,280
 them last Tuesday. I will probably be bringing Mindbug First Contact, a game that I only bought,

208
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,920
 because it fills a challenge on board game geek. I don't know what I'll be bringing. I might not

209
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,480
 bring too many games, but I am playing a card game every day in March, and that includes some of

210
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,720
 the days in the Eastcon. So we'll have to have some sorts of games, but there's been a couple of,

211
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,680
 there was one game where it got to 11 30, and I was like, oh, I have not played a card game today.

212
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,080
 Oh, look, I could play clock, I could play clock patients on the internet. That'll do.

213
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,000
 I am mostly bringing small card games, because they take up less room in my luggage.

214
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:23,760
 The Guff Racer started there. We have two candidates who are Ian Nichols, who is a

215
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:31,360
 Perth fan of very long standing, and Cat Clay, who has won the Ditmar for Best Fan Writer for

216
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,880
 the last two years. So we are delighted to have two excellent candidates, and do please vote.

217
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,160
 You can vote online, or we might put a link in the show notes. That's probably what we'll do. We'll

218
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,960
 put the link to voting for Guff in the show notes. You could also vote at Eastcon at the Fan Funds

219
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,320
 table, and yes, one of those people will be coming to Glasgow, along with the winners of TAF,

220
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,320
 and not the winner of EFF, who will be going to ErasmusCon the following weekend instead, and I have made

221
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,760
 that mistake every single week on the podcast. It's kind of something I do now. I'm just kind of

222
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,840
 overly will-con focused, but I make that mistake every week, so hopefully I will stop making that

223
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,640
 mistake by the time we get to WELCOME, or indeed ErasmusCon in Rotterdam, which I will not be going to.

224
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:23,600
 Voting for the Doc Weir Award will also be happening at the Eastcon, so Doc Weir is given to the

225
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,720
 unsung hero of the Eastcon, or of British, Random, or generally I suppose, and last year it was the

226
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,640
 excellent Claire Breiley of Croydon. This year, Claire will be administering the award because

227
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,880
 the thanks you get for being an unsung hero is being made to do more work behind the scenes,

228
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,560
 as is the great tradition of con running. And so if you would like to vote, I believe there will be

229
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:53,200
 an online option. There will also be a paper option, so do exercise your right to vote,

230
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,880
 and if you're not sure who to vote for, ask around, because there's usually some ideas

231
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,040
 being passed around at the convention. And you can also pass ideas around. Yes, I put the fix in once,

232
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,360
 and it was very good. I felt like a proper smoth. This is a chance to mention one of the things

233
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,560
 that Eastcon has done spectacularly well, which is that they have an Eastcon members portal,

234
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,120
 which you should have had a link to in your email, but you can also just Google it and find it,

235
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,680
 and that has links to the read me, the discord chat, the souvenir book, and voting in the

236
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,120
 dotware award and bs-fay award, and other information about the convention. And I'm hoping it will also

237
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,920
 have, by Thursday, links to vote in all the fanfums races as well. Yes, so as noted, you can go to the

238
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,560
 member portal and vote in the bs-fay awards. This is the only place you can vote. You cannot vote

239
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,840
 on paper, and I will note that you have to vote by noon on Saturday, because the winner will be

240
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,840
 announced at 1pm on Saturday, which I've got to say is a tighter turnaround than I would have been

241
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,520
 happy with, but I guess you can be checking there's no wackiness going on in the votes as you go along.

242
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,920
 If you are on the train to Eastcon, you can still go and log in and vote in the bs-fay awards.

243
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,480
 I mean, it's also ranked choice voting. I hope the spreadsheet is, you know, doing all the elimination

244
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,520
 for them. In best non-fiction long, especially, there are some very good things that you should

245
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,000
 go and vote for, but there are some very good things in all of the categories, and you should cast your

246
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,280
 vote accordingly. In further awards news, so far, announce the finalists for the Nebula Awards,

247
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:35,440
 which will be presented in June, and we also know that the Hugo Awards shortlist will come out at

248
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,840
 Eastcon. And so, we are currently in that 24 hours where we can speculate wildly about the

249
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,760
 Hugo is based on the information for the Nebula Awards, and if you are listening to this

250
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,640
 any point after Friday evening, it's out of date. Indeed, so yeah, there's a sweet spot of about

251
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,640
 36 hours where this podcast will be scorchingly relevant, and after that, it will be, we will

252
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,040
 know the Hugo finalists and it will be less relevant, but still very interesting. After Friday evening,

253
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,160
 you can listen to this and laugh at how completely out of touch we were with the Hugo electorate.

254
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,640
 So I would note that the novel list has two books that we mentioned when we were talking about

255
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,080
 possible novel nominees, which are the Saint of Bright Doors and Translation State.

256
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,040
 I think we also mentioned the Terra Formers by Annalyn Neuets.

257
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,720
 Oh, we might have done, actually.

258
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,800
 I mentioned it on a cat if I didn't like it very much, but yeah, sorry.

259
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,880
 I mean, I was going to put it like that, but yes, but it has been in the buzz.

260
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,000
 Yeah, I think this looks like a solid list, and I would not be surprised if there is significant

261
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
 crossover with the Hugos.

262
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,040
 We didn't mention Witch King, which now that I look at it will surely be on the ballot,

263
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,600
 but I don't think any of us had read it.

264
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,080
 No.

265
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,320
 I'm going to wait for it to be on the ballot and then read it.

266
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,440
 There is that, like...

267
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,640
 Some tour.com, so that's probably probably a shout.

268
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,960
 Yeah, some stuff is such a dead lot for the ballot that I'm like, well, I can just wait until it comes out.

269
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,400
 Like, I expect that to be on there, and to be honest, expect John Scales's latest to be on the Hugo

270
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
 lists, and so I'll wait for them to be in the vote back.

271
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,080
 A lot of the people I hang out with listeners are unrepentant hipsters when it comes to what they

272
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,160
 read, and none of the people that I talk to about science fiction have been talking about,

273
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,720
 Witch King.

274
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,360
 And so, yes, if I'm very honest, hadn't occurred to me, it might be nominated,

275
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,880
 hadn't thought about it at all.

276
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,320
 But now it's on the Nebula list.

277
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,200
 Yes, very obviously, it's probably going to be on the Hugo list.

278
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,080
 I did want to say one thing about the Nebula list and its potential crossover with the Hugo list,

279
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,880
 which is particularly in game writing.

280
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
 So, the Nebula's award game slightly differently to the Hugo,

281
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
 and the Nebula award is specifically for the writing.

282
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,760
 But it is curious that Tia's For The Kingdom is not on the list.

283
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
 Chancesinar and Baldur's Gate 3 are both on the list.

284
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,960
 As is Dredge, which I think we have previously mentioned.

285
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,760
 I did, yeah.

286
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,400
 There's also the Breadmasterise, which I think is a text adventure,

287
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,320
 because I think choice of games is a one of the things that was covered in the 50 Years of Text

288
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
 Games project.

289
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,480
 Alan Week 2 and the Nine Fox Gambit Roleplaying Game by Yun Harley and Marie Brennan.

290
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,360
 But I'm a bit confused by that because I read Roleplaying Game and assumed that it was

291
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,760
 a paper RPG, but then it says "Android" and I'm like, "Is it a phone game?"

292
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,640
 And I don't know.

293
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,160
 Let's find out.

294
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,680
 Live research.

295
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,920
 Yeah, it's Android Press, not Android Phone.

296
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,880
 I thought we talked about the Breadmasterise, and now I feel terrible that we didn't,

297
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,960
 because we probably should have done.

298
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,080
 I think the thing about the Nebula's and its award for game writing is that people look at a game

299
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,880
 like "Tears of the Kingdom" and don't spot the fact that it's got writing in it,

300
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,960
 because that writing doesn't end up being words on the page while you're playing.

301
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,320
 It's the writing is in the design of the scenarios and the puzzles and all of that.

302
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,360
 And I think that this is a reason why you're not going to see games like that on the Nebula's.

303
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,720
 Yeah, I mean, I would word it slightly differently, which is,

304
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,640
 I think Zelda games have "wank writing", and therefore it is not surprising to me that Zelda

305
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,680
 is not on this list.

306
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,960
 It might be that they've leveled up significantly since all of the other Zelda games,

307
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,320
 but I've never played a Zelda game and thought, "Hoh-oh, this is a good writing".

308
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,400
 Okay, fair. I went and looked at the Breadmuss Rise, and it is a 450,000 word interactive

309
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,200
 commissive fantasy baking eldritch horror novel.

310
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,120
 Yes, which sounds like I might have to go and encounter it.

311
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,880
 "Choice of Games" is an app I have on my phone ever since the 50 years of Text Games project

312
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,000
 concluded, but I have not yet actually played any of the games on it,

313
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,160
 because I don't really know where to begin, so this is a good thing,

314
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
 because it gives me a place to begin.

315
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,960
 And I gotta say, 9fox-guy-mit world sounds like a great place to have like an RPG,

316
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,760
 you know, pick your faction, you know, decide what your customs are,

317
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,880
 you know, and there's a lot of space for making a lot of really interesting stuff up there in that

318
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,840
 world, I think.

319
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:18,160
 Yeah, on that topic, I'm extremely curious about an RPG set in that world, because I think one of my

320
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,360
 core criticisms is harsh, but I think one of the things I thought about that world was that I

321
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,680
 wasn't really sure how the internal logic worked in anything approaching a coherent way,

322
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,400
 and I am fascinated by the idea that it's got an internal logic that can be codified into a role

323
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,280
 playing game, and I think I might buy the role playing game just so I can see how that works.

324
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,200
 But also, I had not heard of Android Press, and that is partly because they are, I think,

325
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:50,160
 mostly known for science fiction and not gaming content. I've visited their itch.io page and

326
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,560
 they have published this RPG and they have also published a GMless RPG based on the Sam for the

327
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:02,720
 Wild Built by Becky Chambers, which you can purchase for a price of your own naming.

328
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,720
 So yeah, those are their two games. The game they've done based on the Becky Chambers Nabella

329
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:14,720
 is a hack of Wanda Home, which has been receiving various rave reviews for a while now. It was also

330
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,040
 a Nebula Award finalist, and it won a few NEs as well. NEs are like the Hugo's role playing games.

331
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,680
 I might have to keep an eye on them because they're clearly at the intersection of tabletop gaming

332
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:33,440
 and science fiction. I have just downloaded the Red Must Rise, and I love it already because

333
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,040
 the very first screen is, "Would you like to play an omnivore mode or vegetarian mode or vegan mode

334
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,000
 if you don't want animal products in your baking?" Brilliant. So I like LOD in my baking.

335
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,480
 Yeah, well, my pick for next time's sorted, guys. Liz has put in a link in the show notes.

336
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,280
 Since we've started talking, entitled Hugo Award betting markets. Liz. Yeah.

337
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,600
 Is this a contender for best interactive work? It's not super interactive. So what it is,

338
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,320
 there's a website called Manifold Markets where I think basically you get some fake currency,

339
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,160
 and you can use it to set up your own betting market on anything you want to bet on.

340
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:22,080
 Yeah, so I'm coming by how I found it, but I became aware that someone is running betting markets

341
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:30,400
 for four of the Hugo Fiction categories, novel at novella and short story. And so you can look at

342
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,240
 this and look at how many votes there are for the different items. And if you use your fake money,

343
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,280
 you can move stuff up and down. You can say, "Yes, I think this will be on the ballot." And then

344
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,120
 probably it'll get high percentage. Or you can say, "No, I don't think it will." And then like the

345
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,400
 markets adjust. So it's going to be interesting to see how well it has actually predicted the

346
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:57,520
 Hugo Award. The top six at time of recording are two that are on the Nebula list, translation state

347
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,280
 and Witchking, also some desperate glory by Emily Tesh, Zalinghouse by Alex Harrow,

348
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,320
 the Adventures of Amina Al-Sarafi by Shannon Chakraborty, and starter villain by John Scaldy.

349
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,120
 So they're the top six. And then the next ones are the Terraformers and Water Outlaws. Now, of course,

350
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,200
 I'm discussing this after the Nebula Award ballot came out, but that doesn't actually seem to have

351
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,240
 boosted the Terraformers and the Water Outlaws. So maybe there is not that much information going

352
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,960
 in there. But it is quite interesting. I mean... There's an interesting thing which is that this

353
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,920
 is from 11 traders. Ah, yes. Fair enough. So does that mean that 11 people have bet? Yes.

354
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:46,640
 Yeah, that's fair. I think I think that this is a plausible look at a slice of the voters, but I

355
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,200
 suspect that basically... Because it's got bookshops and bone dust by Travis Baldry down at like 10th.

356
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,200
 And I think what that says to me is that the people who have voted on this are not Baldry fans,

357
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,280
 but I wonder whether Baldry fans and the wider electorate, they might not have a perfect microcosm

358
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,200
 is what I'm saying. This might not be a representative sample, but it is interesting. And also, we should

359
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,520
 all bet on it. How do I bet on it? I send you my affiliate link and you set up an account and then

360
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,440
 I get some bonus fake books. Oh, you should also do that to me.

361
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,400
 And also, you should put that link in the show notes, Liz. Yeah, absolutely.

362
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,720
 And rake in those fake bugs. We are not sponsored by Manifold and Liz received no monetary

363
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,840
 value for plugging Manifold on the pot. Yeah, but she is putting her affiliate link in the show

364
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,240
 notes. We now have to have a thing saying, "Our show notes may contain affiliate links."

365
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,400
 That can be the episode title just to make it very clear.

366
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,640
 Yeah, so we should make our prediction for the ballot, shouldn't we?

367
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,920
 I don't have any predictions. Is that helpful?

368
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,480
 In size of commentary. Okay, we probably shouldn't make predictions, but I think

369
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,960
 I think the top five, the ones on the ballot, are definitely going to include

370
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,600
 the mothwells and the Travis Baldry and maybe the scales again. Oh, it's depressing.

371
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,920
 Doing it based on previous finalists, I would guess it will be the parka chan, the Baldry,

372
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,560
 the Wells, the Harrow, the Lecky and the Scales. That would be my guest based purely on these

373
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:21,440
 are names that we know Hugo people will nominate. But there's a slight wrinkle in that the nominating

374
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,640
 community is it's Chengdu and Glasgow. So it's like a little bit atypical.

375
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,640
 They won't be throwing out the Chinese ballots this time, so that could put a wrinkle on the ballot.

376
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,320
 That is true. There's no Chinese names on here. No, but I think also novel is particularly tricky

377
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,000
 for anyone who is outside China to work out. Because when I was trying to work out what even

378
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,840
 were the things that got thrown off the ballot in Chengdu, it's really difficult to work out

379
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,040
 where they were published or who they were published by, whether actually eligible.

380
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,720
 So yeah, I mean, and the things on this list are just the ones that have been input by,

381
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,280
 you know, the 11 people are bang on them. Yes. But yeah, it will be interesting to see if we do

382
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:08,160
 get another mixed ballot because everyone who voted in site selection in DC for Chengdu got us

383
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,000
 supporting membership, which got automatically turned into a full WUSFUS attending membership

384
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,640
 of Chengdu. And so they will also all have nominating rights, right?

385
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,080
 Yes, that is true. And they obviously, well, not obviously, but they won't have voting

386
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,360
 rights unless they join Glasgow. Because one thing we know is that there are a lot of people

387
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,440
 at the Chengdu Worldcon who did not have a WUSFUS membership, but all those people who voted in

388
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,520
 site selection do you still have a full WUSFUS membership that lets them nominate?

389
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,080
 On the subject, the Hugo Awards, Hugo Girl after the nomination deadline passed,

390
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:48,560
 unrecused themselves. So we think this is generally good because we think recusing is good, but we

391
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,160
 also think winning Hugo Awards in unesterisked years is good. And I'm just happy that I'll be

392
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,640
 able to vote for them again in Seattle. Yes, I think also that the timing of their announcement

393
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:06,160
 was very classy. They obviously waited until Glasgow nominations were closed to say, actually,

394
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,240
 we're going to put ourselves back in the game for Seattle, which I think would have been fair anyway,

395
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,080
 like there was an argument that maybe you should recuse yourself for a year or a couple of years,

396
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,240
 but you don't necessarily have to do it forever anyway. But I think it's totally reasonable that

397
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,000
 if you have won in a year, which now has a big question mark next to it, and you're not really

398
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,800
 enjoying the glory of being a Hugo winner because you're forever wondering about it, that you get

399
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:36,000
 a chance to have an unambiguous win. Good show.

400
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:46,160
 I will do two quick picks that they will be quick. So I have a non-genre pick, which is a video

401
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,320
 game, which is a little bit like a card game called Bilateral, which has been kind of, kind of

402
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,600
 viral if you're in the right place. I first heard about it from reading about the Guardian,

403
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:03,280
 which readers is not how you normally learn about how and I normally learn about video games,

404
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,080
 and I learned it the second time from my kids who were like, "Oh, mum, you should definitely play

405
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,160
 Bilateral, but you better not plan to do anything else for about 72 hours." So that was right.

406
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:20,560
 And it is basically a chap who working alone has discovered a way to make video poker a bit

407
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,760
 more addictive, which is not a thing that it needed, and has written a deck-building road

408
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,600
 like on a poker theme. It's fantastic. It's very, very funny, and it's got lots of things,

409
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,240
 and it is just a poker game. So it's exactly the sort of game I like in that it doesn't have any,

410
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,120
 it doesn't have deep writing, it just has that loop that makes you go, "Oh no, I want to

411
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,720
 have another run and see if I do better than I did in the last run. There are lots of different ways

412
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,600
 to build your deck in order to win. There are also lots of ways in which your deck will not win."

413
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,400
 And despite having a poker theme, there's no gambling involved. You pay once and you get the whole game.

414
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,400
 Nevertheless, it's been given an 18 rating by game raters, because apparently,

415
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,000
 pretending to be about video poker and then gambling is bad, but actually having lots of paid-for

416
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,720
 loop boxes is not so bad. I don't quite understand that, but there we go. So Bellatro, it's very good.

417
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,800
 It's only starts fictional content is that it has got planets in it and also tarot cards,

418
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,920
 but that's not really very starts fictional, I think. So, but it is good. And it's exactly the

419
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,920
 sort of game I like, which is it has that kind of, "Oh, I just need to keep playing this until I

420
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,360
 forget to eat sleep." But then I stop playing it because of my other pick, which will be out by

421
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:43,120
 the time you get this, which is because it's going to the printers tomorrow, which is the conversation

422
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:50,960
 2023 souvenir book, which has excellent writing by all of our guests, well, not writing by all of

423
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,400
 our guests, about all of our guests, and by some of our guests, and then a fascinating and lengthy

424
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,920
 con report about our convention and a, and then all the stuff you'd expect to have like a copy of

425
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,960
 the program and accounts for many previous Easter cons. So it has wonderful things in it, and you

426
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,480
 can either get it as a PDF or if you asked in time a paper copy, but you had to ask by last week.

427
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,480
 One other thing that I believe the Easter con souvenir book will have is a review by Neil Harrison,

428
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:25,040
 who is, who was the guest of honor at this Easter con, and this is a review of iJedi by Michael A.

429
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:32,000
 Stackpole, a Star Wars book about the galaxy's best detective jedi starfighter pilot and lover,

430
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,040
 and distressingly it's an incredibly insightful and good review, which is very annoying because

431
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,880
 you can't win with Neil, he turns out gold no matter what you do, but yes.

432
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,720
 It is a startlingly good review in a number of respects, it's very insightful and it is also

433
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:56,000
 extremely funny. Yes, so Andrew Hogg and I bought the review, it came with a free book,

434
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,800
 but the review was really what we wanted, and we're very happy with it, so we're looking forward

435
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,880
 to other people reading it. Charlie my bike, is that what you're waiting for? I don't know,

436
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,080
 you can if you like. John, you're going to be pleased because... Oh, I like being pleased.

437
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,320
 You're not going to be pleased for the reason you're thinking you're going to be pleased.

438
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,320
 You're going to be pleased because you said at some point that you might try and read all my

439
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:25,200
 picks this year, and I almost picked an entire trilogy of books. Right. And then I thought better

440
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,720
 of it and just picked a YouTube video series. Hey! So I've picked a YouTube video series which

441
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,960
 is called No CGI is really just invisible CGI, and there's three parts out of a planned four parts,

442
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,760
 but I think the three parts are good enough to watch without the fourth. And it's by a VFX artist

443
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,520
 who wanted to kind of take something on about a lot of claims you see in the marketing and

444
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,880
 promotion of films that this film was done entirely with practical effects and there was no CGI

445
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:02,480
 and that that makes it superior. And so he unpicks quite a lot that films going way, way back have

446
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,400
 not always literally been filming everything that's on screen and goes back through a lot of

447
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,920
 stuff about like map paintings and so on. And that this manipulation has always been there.

448
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,160
 And then goes through some films which have kind of marketed themselves as No CGI. We really filmed

449
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,240
 all this and then shows all the CGI in them. And the really interesting bit in one of them is that

450
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,520
 he looks at Barbie, a film which he's obviously very positive about and thinks you know VFX in a

451
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:36,080
 really interesting way. But also in the making of section they basically crudely removed all the

452
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,280
 blue screen to make it look like things weren't filmed on a blue screen background, which is hilarious.

453
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,720
 And you can see how badly they did it in some places because he's like look you can see the

454
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,560
 blue screen through this person's hair. So they're so desperate for people to think that they didn't

455
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,120
 film it on a blue screen that they actually now try to remove it from all the kind of extraneous

456
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:58,480
 material. So I think it's really interesting and it's making a very convincing kind of case for why

457
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,200
 you know No CGI should not be a marketing claim. But also he's got access. He's obviously read a

458
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,160
 lot of interviews, listened to a lot of interviews in like cinematography magazines and so on and

459
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,440
 also has loads and loads of examples from these like VFX reels that the different studios do to

460
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,480
 show you exactly where the VFX is. And a lot of the time one either it looks like magic to me or

461
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,040
 it's like they VFX something that I would never have considered you would do by kind of CGI.

462
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,160
 So yeah it's interesting it'll take you about an hour to watch.

463
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,200
 So it does sound very interesting it sounds very much up my street but if you are interested in this

464
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:42,960
 the VFX artist Todd Vaziri is on Mastodon I believe Bruce Kai and on X and he is a VFX artist who's

465
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,040
 been working in the field for a very long time. His first his first movie was I believe the first

466
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,280
 Michael Bay Transformers but he worked on like I'm Antu, Rho Gua, Navatar. He's what he works at ILM

467
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,680
 and he does this as well is he he basically he specializes in retweeting tweets from studios

468
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,560
 where they've said we shot everything practically and being like nope I worked on the VFX effect

469
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,040
 that's in this screenshot and it is great like so if you like this sort of thing it is very very

470
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,520
 good but yes no so I'm fascinated to watch this because this is really in my wheelhouse because I

471
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,880
 think I think it's just absolutely fascinating this is a great pick.

472
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,320
 The history of the history of cinema and the history of theatre the history of theatre is all about

473
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,560
 doing things on stage that people don't believe you know we've been doing this for hundreds and

474
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,720
 hundreds of years thousands of years maybe in fact no 10,000 years I'm going to say 10,000

475
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,560
 years because I went to the Ice Age exhibition at the British Museum I've probably mentioned this

476
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:51,680
 before and they had tools that I say that we that we think that Ice Age people's used in order to

477
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,080
 create to put in front of fires so that it would cast shadows on walls so that they could tell

478
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,240
 theatrical stories using VFX effects in 8000 BCE they can do that.

479
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,760
 I'm gonna talk about something that isn't genre which is I played a card game at a convention

480
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,920
 and it was called Overs and it's a card game about cricket. It's basically complicated rock

481
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,160
 paper scissors but in the gloriousest possible way I'm just really enthusiastic about it I won't

482
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,160
 have a copy of it before this easter con but I will be bringing it to a future easter con probably

483
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,000
 it was really good it really captured the kind of the trying to outthink your opponent of like

484
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,600
 you know trying to ball the right ball based on what shot you think the bat is going to play

485
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:43,200
 and voice versa it was really really neat but I did that at the convention air con which is a

486
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,560
 Harrogate board gaming convention which occurs in march every year and I went down to Yorkshire

487
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,440
 with a couple of pals for the day and we went to air con it was in the Harrogate Convention Center

488
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:03,920
 which is opposite the majestic where the 2018 easter con was and it was really good convention but

489
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,160
 it was a bit new for me because it's the first time in a long time that I've been to a convention

490
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,800
 kind of almost on my own where I didn't really know anyone and it was kind of an interesting

491
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,560
 because that isn't a common experience for me and so I think on a future episode we might talk a

492
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,000
 little bit about that listeners foreshadowing but it was good I enjoyed it I also played a

493
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,480
 great game of a lot of the clock tower where I managed to convince everyone I was the mayor

494
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,040
 but I was actually the imp and then we won and I made a lot of enemies that day it's good yeah we

495
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,880
 we now have a balaclava of evil for situations like this that happened in our house which we

496
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,720
 have liberated from the game it was what's attached to when I decluttered my copy of war on terror

497
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,840
 the evil balaclava was the one thing I was like oh but I could keep it because then I'd have the

498
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:56,720
 evil balaclava but does one really need an evil balaclava yes I regret getting rid of that game

499
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,000
 every day yeah I kept the cones too because I make front and play games and cones are very useful

500
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,720
 for a printer play game and also to quote pop culture phenomenon it's about the cones

501
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:15,600
 cones of duncher cones of duncher every so often I will be playing a game and I will

502
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,360
 realize that I have gotten off base on what it is I'm supposed to be doing and I've got distracted

503
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,320
 by some neat mechanic that won't help me win and then I just mutter to myself it's about the cones

504
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,760
 this is john's poker towel if you're ever playing poker against john

505
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:37,520
 that was the old thought podcast and it's goodbye for me um it's goodbye for me and it's goodbye for me

506
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:57,520
 [Music]

507
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,800
 coming on the train aren't you no no no you're not coming on the train no I'm going to come

508
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,640
 with Neil and Nick and there's a very real worry that they'll want to listen to octop

509
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,080
 so if we're listening to this in the car hi Neil and Nick I hope it's not all quick oh that's quite

510
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:18,000
 funny though isn't it I have previously put my headphones in and listened to another podcast

511
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,360
 because I'm in a car where people are listening to octop was that also Neil and Nick uh no I think

512
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,000
 it was Ian actually I don't want to listen to my own voice for any more time than that's the answer

513
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,680
 when when I'm doing the listen the listen for editing I do I often if there's people around I'm

514
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,200
 still kind of like oh no I'm going to do this with headphones on so you can't hear

515
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,680
 the theme music for this episode was fanfare for space by kevin mccloud in competec.com
