00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 Are you suggesting that was not gold content that is going in the podcast, John?

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,200
 No, but I am going to say that that was the 25th episode of the Octa thought podcast.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:27,760
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 25th episode of Octa Thorpe, the podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,840
 This is the episode for the 18th of February 2021 and I'm John Coxon and I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hello everyone, it's John here just interjecting very quickly to tell you all that this weekend,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,400
 Saturday the 20th of February, is PicoCon 38, which has gone online and is called Automata.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,880
 There are details in the show notes and the guests of honor are Jeffrey Somers, Dan Morrin,

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:02,160
 S.J. Kinkade and Brian David Johnson. I'll be there as I believe will Alison and so we might see you in the bar.

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,800
 Now back to the episode and we are recording this on Valentine's Day.

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,920
 I love you both. Love you both.

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,760
 I better say I love you both or it's going to sound weird if I didn't say it, didn't I?

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,520
 And we've also had some letters of comment.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,080
 We have lots.

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,640
 No, no locks.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,080
 And we have a lot of different, proud locks.

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,120
 Yeah, Bridget Bradshaw, right?

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:35,320
 To say that she used to log all her films on that box and she thought she had only kind of full off the wagon in the last year.

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,840
 And then she went on her little box account and it's actually been since 2016.

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,400
 So she's back on the wagon. Yes, I too am on the wagon.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,880
 I have been logging my 2021 film watching, which is the vast majority of which has been genre,

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,600
 but there's been some comedies.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,680
 So if anyone wants to follow me watching best dramatic presentation,

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,640
 eligible films, then I am John Coxon in a fit of imagination.

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,560
 And I am Bohemian coast.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
 Yes, and Liz is not on letterboxed.

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,160
 What?

27
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,560
 Great.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,600
 Do you watch movies?

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,480
 They don't have films in Thailand.

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,320
 We we have films in Thailand.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,880
 I can in fact go out to the cinema and watch a film right now.

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,520
 I think we do have films, but I just don't tend to log them.

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,400
 I think logging book this is about as far as I can get.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,280
 And really, I don't want something that loves just movies.

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,880
 I would like something that just logs like all TV I watch and all movies.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,760
 If you want that, then you want a service called Tract, which is T-R-A-K-T dot TV.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,640
 But in effect, you don't want it because logging all the TV you watch is incredibly

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,880
 tedious and takes ages.

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,280
 I used to log the TV I watched, but you watch so much TV that you watch way more

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,840
 programs of TV than you do movies or books.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,680
 And so logging all your TV just like very quickly becomes this never-ending,

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,720
 grinding, tedious thing, whereas the other two I feel less so.

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,600
 I need to say at this point that when John says you in this context, he means John.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,880
 I mean, I watch maybe seven episodes of TV a week, but that is still far more

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,360
 than I watch movies or read books.

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,280
 And I suspect that's true for most people unless you are a very quick reader,

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,320
 or unless you almost exclusively watch movies.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,960
 To be fair, it's Spanya Whitewatch more movies than she does TV episodes.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,600
 But I think it's Spanya is at the edge of the bell curve in that.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,000
 If you are somebody who prioritizes movies and books because you tend to think

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,280
 that a lot of TV is extruded entertainment product.

52
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,480
 Yeah, that.

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,080
 When I say log my TV, I don't necessarily want to log every single thing.

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,320
 What I want to be able to say is like, oh, I finished watching the expand season

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,600
 five log that whole thing.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,960
 Ah, no, that is not no Tract as episode by episode.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
 Yeah, no, I don't want that.

58
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,120
 I may want episode by episode.

59
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,040
 This is complicated that I think TV tracking and people can write to us about

60
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,840
 this. I think TV tracking is interesting because you kind of want to log that

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,520
 you've started watching a series and you want to what log when you finish

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,360
 watching a series and you don't necessarily want to log that you gave off

63
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,760
 on a series, a episode seven of season two because it really wasn't going anywhere.

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,960
 And there are 19 seasons of it and life is too short.

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
 Yes.

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,280
 So listeners is taking us less than five minutes to get a cast

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,320
 offically off topic today.

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,200
 We hope you're enjoying the podcast is almost entirely my fault.

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,560
 Footrobe, I apologize.

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,040
 Bridget also mentions the Bosco fan fund auction and we're going to mention that

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,960
 later listeners.

72
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,120
 This is foreshadowing, which I think they do in TV and movies and books and maybe

73
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,080
 other media. Next lock is from Chris Garcia.

74
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,600
 He titled his email lock on the episode, whose number I've forgotten.

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
 The context should reveal it in due time.

76
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,080
 So it was 24 Chris, just, you know, Chris writes another strong episode that made

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,400
 me listen with only two of the sound sources going.

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,080
 So clearly what we have to aspire to is that one day Chris will give us half an

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,280
 hour of complete attention and we will ever taint vanish, Nirvana.

80
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,440
 I I thought this was a very revealing lot because I think it is true that people

81
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,160
 believe their ability to multitask is much better than it actually is.

82
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,240
 While I think most people can listen to a podcast whilst also doing a thing that

83
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,240
 is using a different part of their brain, like I don't know, knitting or walking or

84
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,840
 whatever or being Chris Garcia.

85
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,480
 I am not convinced that you can listen to multiple sound sources at once and get

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,360
 full benefit from all of them.

87
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,840
 And I think that Chris might kidding himself and I feel that I would be interested

88
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,280
 in other people's views on this.

89
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,960
 I think that if anyone can do it, Christopher J.

90
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,520
 Garcia Esquire is the man.

91
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,240
 I think if Chris really was listening to two of the things at the same time and still

92
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,440
 managed to write a lot, which basically covers everything we covered in the last

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,320
 episode, then I'm pretty impressed.

94
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,080
 Go for it, Chris.

95
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,680
 He's a clearly a wizard, but we knew this.

96
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,520
 Also, you say you have a friend who runs a serial podcast party that is another

97
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,160
 concept, please write to us about how a serial podcast party works.

98
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,240
 And indeed, anyone else running weird format parties, please write to us about how

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,840
 they work and by write to us, I think we mean invite us.

100
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,440
 I mean, yup.

101
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,360
 Chris also mentions his nominations for Best Chameck Long Form, which is going to be

102
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,280
 welcome to Night Vale, Palm Springs, The Mandalorian and Wonder Woman 1984.

103
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,600
 I think we mentioned Palm Springs and Wonder Woman last episode.

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,200
 But I don't think we mentioned The Mandalorian as a contender for long form.

105
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,080
 So thank you for mentioning that, Chris.

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,560
 But I think it clearly is.

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,680
 And I'm interested by the reference to Welcome to Night Vale, which is something

108
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,760
 that I started listening to and concluded was not moving.

109
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,960
 Interestingly or excitingly enough for me, but people do seem to like it quite a

110
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,120
 lot. It has a lot of fans.

111
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,880
 It does.

112
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,960
 The Vast of Night, which I'll talk about later, has a lot in common with Welcome

113
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,320
 Tonight.

114
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,240
 Mark Plummer wrote to us

115
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,840
 that say that we should extract the sound by of Liz saying Jesus at 49.

116
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,920
 33 or thereabouts for future use.

117
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,840
 And he says he's sure that we can monetize it.

118
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,960
 He could use it two or three times in every work conference call.

119
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,960
 So Liz has a huge and sparkling future as a voice over.

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,360
 You know how you can like pay a fiver and someone bring a goat to your zoom call.

121
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
 What?

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
 OK, have you ever seen that?

123
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,880
 Oh, hang on though. This was on the news quiz, wasn't it?

124
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
 Yes. No, OK, yes.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
 But explain for the listeners who are not familiar.

126
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,520
 There's a farm and you can pay them a fiver and they will bring a goat to a zoom

127
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,160
 call for you like to liven up your weekly zoom calls or whatever.

128
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,040
 If anyone would like to pay me to turn up to the zoom call, just like log in and say,

129
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,040
 Jesus and then leave, I'm available.

130
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,240
 Mark also sends us some statistics.

131
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,960
 I like this.

132
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,120
 And I mentioned statistics that I would like to see, try and think of one for every

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,880
 episode and then Mark will magically do the work for me.

134
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,040
 The sort of listenership I like now that you've revealed that that's your strategy,

135
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,280
 Liz, it might backfire.

136
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,040
 In return for this, I will turn up to your zoom calls.

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,680
 And see.

138
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,280
 Brilliant.

139
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,600
 Mark has run numbers for us of those numbers.

140
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,400
 4,624 members as per the long list,

141
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,000
 including attending, supporting and to some degree a day members.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,760
 I'm not sure I can see them.

143
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,960
 They've had day members, but I might be wrong about that, including some members

144
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,040
 who don't have voting rights because they joined too late.

145
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,160
 I would I would say that my experience of virtual conventions is a lot of people.

146
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
 This is me, not Mark.

147
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,400
 A lot of people join right up to the last minute

148
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,920
 for online conventions.

149
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,520
 And I assume that those people will generically not have voting rights.

150
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,600
 So that might be quite a large number.

151
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,920
 Two of those 2,221 people voted in at least one Hugo category, which is slightly less

152
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,400
 than half. And the most votes in any category was 1,873 for best novel.

153
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,120
 So of the people who voted about 80 percent vote for the best novel.

154
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,480
 For Dublin, those numbers were 8,430 members of whom 3,097 voted in the Hugo's

155
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,360
 slightly pure as a proportion.

156
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,160
 Most in a category was 2,540 for best dramatic presentation,

157
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
 longer get around about 80 percent.

158
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,600
 Yeah. And then there are many other examples as well.

159
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,320
 Did not really say I'm off to play Arkham Horror now.

160
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,760
 There may be a typo in that sentence.

161
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,360
 Yeah, a pyjima typo is I'm off to play Arkham Horror now.

162
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,000
 Yeah, I think that's right.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,720
 I think we so so our target for I think this podcast should have 21 targets.

164
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,760
 It's like that, but our target for 21 should be to get Claire

165
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,840
 about play Arkham Horror with us.

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
 Mark is less into games than Claire is.

167
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,680
 So I think if I was going to guess which person we would be able to entice more easily,

168
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,520
 I think I would guess that Claire was more

169
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,440
 enticed than Mark.

170
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,920
 This may spur letters of comment from both disagreeing with my take.

171
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,800
 But yeah, I feel we may have to leave this one till 2022 and the distant future

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 and we can all gather together and play it in person with some beer.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,880
 Beer.

174
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,920
 Big this will be a more appealing prospect than seeing for a different computer for four hours.

175
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,000
 And then Claire wrote in, she mentions a mistake we made that we're not going to go into.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,520
 And then she also notes that if she started, if her and Mark started shuffling all

177
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,800
 of their Nova Awards around for our amusement, the cloud of dust stood up would

178
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,200
 make us cough a lot and that's a bit too worrying at the moment.

179
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
 So yes, that is a good point.

180
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,720
 Thank you, Claire, for catching a properly embarrassing era.

181
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,960
 And I've said we should say what the era was and John has explained to me why we should not do that.

182
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,200
 I'm probably just being paranoid.

183
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,520
 And she has also said that everyone should read all of the murderbot dairies,

184
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,200
 which I have taken away as a target.

185
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,800
 Yes, well, I've got them.

186
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,440
 I've got them on.

187
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
 I've got them on order from the library.

188
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,600
 I believe the third one is on my device now, but we will get on to that in a minute.

189
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,720
 And Christina writes in to say that she

190
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,600
 learned a lot from the mask on panel on podcasting and

191
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,560
 she sort of talks about some of the stuff she learned about microphones and whatnot.

192
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,040
 But she does say that she'd like to add that she never said that Lily and love

193
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,160
 laughing very loudly caused problems with editing bad Alison.

194
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,920
 No, I think I might have said that.

195
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,000
 So there we go.

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,560
 Whenever I hear Lillian laughing on the podcast, it makes me miss evenings where

197
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
 Lillian laughs on my sofa.

198
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,520
 Oh, yeah, that's fair. That is very fair.

199
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,360
 OK, and my red wine bill is way down.

200
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,560
 I mean, tell him to cheer up.

201
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,000
 We don't want a sad red wine bill.

202
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,160
 Fine.

203
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,280
 She says there's one benefit to you having a regular recording schedule, which is she

204
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
 knows when to get her comments in.

205
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,440
 And that's true because we received this yesterday evening.

206
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,400
 So thank you very much, Christina, brilliant.

207
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,160
 And Rosin tweeted us to say that she's moved her desk into her living room because

208
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,880
 it's got a nicer view.

209
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,480
 But she then attached a picture of a cat hogging said desk.

210
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,880
 And I think that might really be more of the reason as a good

211
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,000
 man, having a desk somewhere where there is a cat is always preferable to somewhere

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,840
 where there isn't.

213
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,440
 Fuse expressed by John Cox and may not reflect all of the members of the Octa

214
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,360
 Thought podcast.

215
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,840
 They reflect two thirds of the OctaPod podcast.

216
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,120
 Yeah, I understand the time and outlier in not wanting furry, furry creatures wandering

217
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,280
 through my workspace.

218
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,120
 Oh, God, we're going to get somebody letters now.

219
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,040
 I know.

220
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,280
 I mean, firstly, you've got a son and a husband and we were listening to your

221
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,240
 opinions on that earlier.

222
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,840
 So all I've got is a cat and much easier to deal with Alison.

223
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,520
 My husband is not particularly furry.

224
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,200
 My son, I will grant you his pretty bloody furry.

225
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,080
 I've got a gecko again.

226
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,640
 Yeah.

227
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,080
 I think it's a different one.

228
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,960
 I bought some anti geckos, Ray.

229
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,080
 You should tag them.

230
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,920
 Can you please quantify how furry is your gecko on a scale of not furry to furry?

231
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,520
 I think it is very much on the not furry end.

232
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,680
 You've bought some anti gecko spray.

233
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,280
 Look, I mean, OK, so I have not got to this extent of buying anti cat spray.

234
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,840
 OK, yeah, but to cut regularly into your house and the hide in the skirting boards.

235
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,640
 Anyway, back on topic.

236
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,200
 Yes.

237
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,680
 So DC wrote in to DC tweeted to say that the perils are reading well tired.

238
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,640
 He looked at the info for last episode and thought it said, please let email your

239
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,720
 letters of contempt.

240
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,040
 So if anyone does have any letters of contempt, please send them to this.

241
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,240
 Never happens.

242
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,840
 And then finally, Duncan McGregor tweeted to ask whether we are going to discuss

243
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,600
 the we to bits and beans thing.

244
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,240
 So for those who don't know, there was some tweets in which we to bits suggested

245
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,280
 you could have we to bits with beans.

246
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,160
 This is baked beans for a non-British listener.

247
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,400
 And then there were a lot of funny follow ups.

248
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,360
 And then every British band, every British large brand posted, I think it must

249
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,400
 be the coordinated effort to say to make some quite funny and some rather less

250
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,960
 funny jokes tying their brand into the concept of like spec savers said, let's

251
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,360
 take our glasses off and that sort of thing.

252
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,240
 They had tweeted the day before about Marmite on we have it, but that had not

253
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,000
 quite that had not quite captured the zeitgeist as effectively.

254
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,160
 No, that's because my my time we to fix is perfectly normal.

255
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,560
 My time we to fix is normal.

256
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,680
 Not sure that's it.

257
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,800
 Marmalade on we to fix is normal.

258
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 Bait beans on we is not.

259
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,920
 I'd like to just say normal on we mix is milk and everything else is pretty unusual,

260
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,720
 I would say.

261
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
 But it's not unknown.

262
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,000
 The reason why we beans on we to bits doesn't work is that in the time it takes,

263
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,880
 I've explained this to people and they're kind of like in the time it takes to heat

264
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,280
 beans, you can also make toast.

265
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,960
 So there's no point using we to bits as the substrate field.

266
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,880
 But when I explain this, people were like, oh, you mean people heat up their beans?

267
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:50,720
 So cold beans on cold we to fix does make a certain amount of sense.

268
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,800
 But probably only if you've had a certain amount of alcohol, which is a lot.

269
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,120
 So no, do not do this.

270
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,960
 Do not send us beans on which books.

271
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,160
 Yeah, because I would say that the only thing worse than beans on we to fix is

272
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,160
 beans in general or possibly every social media manager in the UK trying to think

273
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,680
 up a funny comment to make about beans on we to fix.

274
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,880
 I got no sense to humor.

275
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,680
 Speaking of which, bigs, I have a milkman now.

276
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,440
 Hello, because I was like the problem.

277
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,000
 So you don't want to cater a gecko, but milkman, sons and husbands, they're all fine.

278
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,160
 My milkman does not wander thoroughly through my workspace.

279
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,400
 Yeah, anyway, right.

280
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,960
 So on to the topics.

281
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:45,720
 So firstly, Alison is at Boscone.

282
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,480
 I am.

283
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,360
 It's possible the reason I've been detached this weekend is that I've been at Boscone,

284
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:57,160
 which is using the new Grenadine single sign on system to run where you log in

285
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,440
 to Grenadine, which is a very easy pro.

286
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,200
 It's got the kind of password free login where you type your email address in

287
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,440
 and they send you a link logged in and then it is remembered my login across all

288
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,080
 weekend on my main device, which has made me very happy because lots of things don't

289
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,280
 do that. And then you're into everything and everything in this case consists of a

290
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,440
 lot of kind of web pages and documents and things and also zooms for the individual

291
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,320
 program item.

292
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,960
 So it's kind of hooking into Zoom's API and that works pretty well.

293
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,160
 And also chats everywhere.

294
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,880
 And this is sort of instead of discord, but it's not been for me working as well as a

295
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,160
 discord does because every individual item and every individual fan table and dealers

296
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,720
 table and so on has a chat area.

297
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,280
 But you can't kind of look at all the chats and go, ah-ha, those are the places

298
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,440
 where chat is happening.

299
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,040
 You just have to kind of look at this huge convention and go.

300
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,360
 I wonder if there's some chat around here.

301
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,800
 So Henry Bailey, if you're listening to this, I'm going to I'm going to give you

302
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,000
 this feedback in a very precise way.

303
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,320
 I'm going to wrap it around a brick and I don't think it's as good as discord,

304
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,760
 but I think it could be as good as discord if Grenadine kind of shifted up a gear

305
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,840
 in this direction and actually single sign on is lovely.

306
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,680
 It is clearly it is clearly the future, but at the moment it's not quite there yet.

307
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,000
 But just got the Bosco and obviously has its its great Bosco and programme and we

308
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,840
 have fan funds auction at which we auction many things, not including wete books,

309
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,720
 but including a box of rocks, which I thought was a very creative use of the

310
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,040
 United States Postal Service's flat rate boxes, which mean that you can take by a

311
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,400
 box of a given the size of $50 you can fill it with rocks and send it to anywhere

312
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,440
 in the United States.

313
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,920
 And lots of other stuff and we raised $1000 for fan funds, including guff, taff,

314
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,760
 duff and the otherwise award, which is the award formerly known as the James

315
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,360
 Street Junior Award.

316
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,400
 And it was a lot of fun.

317
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,840
 And then I went to a party and that is why I am completely

318
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,800
 discombobulated this morning as we record because I did not get my normal

319
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,320
 gentle, peaceful night's sleep before an octal recording session.

320
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
 I stayed up late and parties instead.

321
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,320
 Yeah.

322
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,960
 Is that what you want? Was there anything else you wanted to know about Bosco?

323
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,040
 Yeah. Are they specific rocks or just generic rocks in a box?

324
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,000
 So I believe that when Jerry sends you a box of kipple, that you have won in a

325
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,800
 fan fund auction, she has a discussion with you to ascertain your interests.

326
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,000
 And then she sends you things that align with your interests from her very large

327
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,880
 collection of rocks and other things.

328
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,720
 Oh, I see.

329
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,680
 No, that sounds nice.

330
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,040
 It sounded like literally someone was going to go outside, scoop up a pile of rubble and ship it to you.

331
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,000
 I suspect some of the rocks are going to be more interesting than others.

332
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,760
 So and the fan fund auction raised a thousand dollars.

333
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,840
 That's right. Pretty good.

334
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,160
 Yeah.

335
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,240
 Nice. Very good.

336
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,760
 Very good.

337
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,240
 And you were able to auction because you have had problems with your voice at real life

338
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,000
 or options, but you don't have those on a microphone.

339
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,840
 I understand.

340
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,360
 Yeah.

341
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,240
 I mean, I feel like I am wondering whether I need to.

342
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,520
 I've asked Eastacon whether we can have a fan fund auction at Eastacon and I am

343
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,720
 going and obviously we'll be able to do it for this.

344
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,440
 For future Easter Colin, for future fan fund auctions, I am going to start to say

345
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,320
 to conventions, could you please sort out all of the auctioneers with throat mics

346
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,960
 as you do have those things at Eastacons these days?

347
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,800
 And I think let's actually take care of ourselves in the future because I was.

348
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,760
 Yeah, it was very destructive to my voice.

349
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,240
 Now I really used to love auctioning and I had to stop and now I can do it again.

350
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,160
 So that's quite nice.

351
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,640
 And Marchin and Gillian helped me and Jerry Sullivan put it all together and I am

352
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,400
 Martin did all of our backs back of the house account and see and it was great.

353
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,000
 We're also running the dead dog for Bosco.

354
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,240
 And so this hasn't happened yet, but but the dead dog party at Bosco will be a

355
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,600
 fan of his party later today.

356
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,920
 So I will be back partying tonight because I'd like nothing.

357
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,520
 I like nothing better than partying in the dead of night with people who were five

358
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,640
 hours behind me.

359
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,160
 So they're all just getting up to having really good fun at the point where I

360
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,040
 absolutely positively have to go to bed if I'm to get everything done on Monday.

361
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,640
 Liz will probably be familiar with it.

362
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,640
 Yes, welcome to my world, Alison.

363
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,200
 But if you're very good, you can get up and party with them again in the morning.

364
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,480
 Liz can icon.

365
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,240
 I think that's the difference between being five hours behind and being seven

366
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,800
 hours behind, actually.

367
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,680
 Yeah, it does make a difference, although I think I prefer it when it's six because

368
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,920
 of the shared daytime hours and we will we will be six again by the time we get

369
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,040
 to con which will help.

370
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,320
 I believe significantly.

371
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,920
 Anyway, that's not really interesting.

372
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,240
 Podcast I did not go to Boscon or Capricon precisely because of these time

373
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,080
 zone things. Oh, sorry.

374
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,800
 Oh, God.

375
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,960
 Can we just redo the entire last segment with Bosco?

376
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,960
 No, but it's not Boscon either, right?

377
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,240
 So Liz said Boscon, but it's definitely not Boscon as a Boscon.

378
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,600
 Oh, sorry, because it's got an E on it.

379
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,080
 This is why I don't like ease on the end of things.

380
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,760
 I'm like in San Francisco, Moscone Center is pronounced Moscone.

381
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,440
 So I assume Boscone was pronounced Boscone and then every little I really

382
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,160
 thought it's Boscon, but then people say Boscon and it's like make sure that

383
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,800
 your cons call the thing that people can pronounce and spell.

384
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,840
 Easter con.

385
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
 Everyone can pronounce and spell it.

386
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,680
 That's a plus in branding.

387
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,240
 I'm telling you.

388
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,560
 I'm really looking for yes to cone.

389
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,280
 Yes to go.

390
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,560
 Yes to go.

391
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,480
 Yeah, the problem is that I have only ever seen the Moscone Center written down.

392
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,200
 And so I thought it was the Moscone Center.

393
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,440
 So here's part of the problem.

394
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,920
 OK, so Boscone is called Boscone because it's a reference to the works of E.

395
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,280
 Doc Smith. Oh, and he was that old man, which is why they also award the Skylark

396
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:00,280
 Award, which is an award with a very funny story attached to it, which is read out

397
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,440
 at the beginning, which is now read out at the beginning of every Skylark Award

398
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,760
 ceremony, which was on opposite, which I didn't get a chance to hear yesterday

399
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,680
 because it was on opposite the fanfon's auction.

400
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,000
 But but but there is a very funny story about the Skylark Award, which is shaped

401
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,160
 like a giant lens because it reflects the works of E.

402
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,240
 Which are I think fading into obscurity at this point.

403
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,600
 And I would have to say rightly so.

404
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,280
 I think it's a very good example of work that is definitely worth reading.

405
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:34,040
 If you're interested in the history of science fiction and probably not otherwise

406
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,680
 worth your time and fun fact.

407
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,600
 E. Doc Smith got married in boys Idaho, which I'm pretty sure is pronounced

408
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,520
 boyzy. Boscone happens in Boston, right?

409
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,160
 That's why I was thinking they rhymed, but they don't rhyme.

410
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,680
 It should be called Boscone. Yeah.

411
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,440
 You're you're 100 percent right that it should rhyme. OK, and it doesn't.

412
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,680
 OK, so here's what they will have got.

413
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,360
 We're a convention in Boston.

414
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,200
 We should call it Boscone and someone has said would have said, oh, no, we should

415
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,600
 call it Boscone and that's that that will have been very funny at the time when,

416
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,760
 which is about 150 years ago, when everybody at that convention would have

417
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,960
 been familiar with the works of the E. Doc Smith.

418
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,120
 But I just I found it funny that he got married in a town that has a trailing E.

419
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,880
 And if we applied this logic, it would be boys, but it is definitely Boise.

420
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,760
 OK, I also didn't know that.

421
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,720
 So this is the thing we're trailing E's.

422
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,840
 I'm just pronouncing all of America wrong.

423
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,760
 This is the thing we're trailing E's trailing E's make things hard to pronounce.

424
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,920
 They're there and it's it's an unforced error.

425
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,520
 It's a shame it is the sort of both Boscone and Capricon are the cons where, you know,

426
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,880
 I've heard they are fun and I would have liked to attended them.

427
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,320
 But the timing was just not going to work.

428
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,360
 So I will they're fun in very different ways.

429
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,400
 Oh, yes.

430
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,400
 I know they they they they are at the two opposing ends of where

431
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,160
 traditional science fiction fandom is at the moment.

432
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,960
 My only rant about it is is this it's not good enough.

433
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,960
 It's not good enough to have chat attached to items and fan table.

434
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,800
 You have to have somewhere we are still failing at the job of helping

435
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,640
 people see what what all is going on right now.

436
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,120
 Yeah, what you want is to be able to replicate that feeling of wondering

437
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,760
 around the con, seeing what's going on.

438
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,280
 Yeah.

439
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,080
 Easter card.

440
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,520
 They've announced they're not using discord or zoom.

441
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,920
 Yes, to Kone.

442
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,000
 Yes, to Kone have announced that they are not using either discord or zoom, which is

443
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,440
 quite funny because they are already using discord.

444
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,920
 I have some thoughts about this, which I'm going to quickly outline before you to

445
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:55,120
 get onto this topic, which is when I was going through the punctuation surveys

446
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,680
 sent out, which I am currently tidying up for publication, one of the things that

447
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:08,200
 was said by someone was that they felt that they had needed to go to punctuation

448
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,520
 in order to be able to attend punctuation.

449
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,680
 And one of the things they talked about was they found it all very overwhelming

450
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,760
 at the time, but at the end of the convention, they were like, oh, if you did

451
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,600
 this again, I'd know how it worked and I'd be able to do it and it would be fine.

452
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,040
 And we were aware of that as a problem going into punctuation, which one of the

453
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,480
 reasons why we started the discord early and things like that to try and mitigate

454
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,840
 this as best we could, but we were aware that that wasn't going to be enough on its

455
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
 own to mitigate it.

456
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,280
 So we were aware that there was going to be an element of this.

457
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,600
 But I will also say that one of the reasons I personally was excited to run

458
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,560
 punctuation was because I suspected that this would be true of British fans going

459
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,440
 to other big British conventions running a similar way.

460
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,320
 And so part of why I wanted to run punctuation was to get people used to online

461
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,720
 convention platforms so that when they got to say a big convention like an Easter

462
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,920
 con using these platforms, they would be less taken aback and more ready to do it.

463
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,240
 And so we get on to East con not using the same platforms, which is fine because

464
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,400
 I don't think these platforms are perfect.

465
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,320
 And I definitely think there's room for improvement.

466
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,560
 But what I will say is that no platform in the world is so good that you don't have

467
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,600
 to learn how to use it.

468
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,440
 There's always some learning curve and it can be a very shallow learning curve,

469
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,280
 but it's still there. And so the worry I have is that Easter con is now six weeks

470
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,320
 away and they still haven't announced what it is they're using.

471
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,920
 They haven't announced what platform is going to be available on.

472
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,920
 They haven't announced how we're going to get used to using it.

473
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,400
 And I'm a little bit worried about that.

474
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,280
 And I think this is a problem.

475
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,600
 And I would like to note what extent you to think I'm being a nervous nelly.

476
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,000
 I have a point where I start worrying about Easter and the state of the East

477
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,320
 con every year, which is Shrove Tuesday.

478
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,920
 And it's made easy for me because I the government tells me to eat pancakes.

479
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,720
 And so I eat pancakes and start panicking about the Easter con.

480
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,320
 That is not till Tuesday, so I've not started panicking yet.

481
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,560
 But by the time this episode comes out, I will have started panicking.

482
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,760
 So I think it's OK to already talk about panicking.

483
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,400
 And when I eat we to fix it.

484
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,160
 But I when you eat we to fix it.

485
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,320
 Wow.

486
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,680
 Damn. Let me try that joke again.

487
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,440
 And my tradition, of course, is that I eat pancakes on a show of Tuesday with

488
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,440
 filling such as chicken and Nutella, but

489
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,880
 and we to fix.

490
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,760
 Yeah, now I'm not going to eat we to fix pancakes on Tuesday, but I am going to

491
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,160
 consider the matter.

492
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,480
 It is a chicken Nutella.

493
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,880
 Classic chicken moly pancakes.

494
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,000
 It's a very basic chicken moly.

495
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,480
 Sorry, a chicken mole.

496
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,760
 I'm now wondering if I can make a chicken mole pancake using chicken, using

497
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,160
 Marxist, but says Chuckie chicken and Nutella, whether that will actually work,

498
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,320
 which it might welcome to the after four pay podcast in which we discuss how best

499
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,560
 to abuse trailing ease or words.

500
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,680
 I think my point of which I get weird about the Easter con is probably about

501
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,600
 like the Tuesday of Easter week, if I'm not otherwise involved.

502
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,320
 So it's not a code to me to start being concerned about the Easter con.

503
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,400
 You know, this con can stand its own two feet, but I do take John's points.

504
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,320
 So I think there's two points.

505
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,640
 One is that they are using some other technology, which is not discord or zoom

506
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,800
 based, but is going to be good.

507
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,840
 This is perfectly possible, but

508
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,080
 and it's also possible that since I we last looked around at technologies to use,

509
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,480
 which I think I lasted before punctuation, that a bunch more good technologies have

510
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,000
 come out that might actually be really great for this kind of thing, because when we

511
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,920
 looked at it, a lot of them had, you know, flaws of one kind or another, which meant

512
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,520
 they were not really suitable for punctuation.

513
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,600
 So it is possible that something else great out there, but I do want to know what it

514
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,960
 is. And I think there's a point about a learning curve is very true because for

515
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,120
 me, discord has like almost no learning curve.

516
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,480
 I logged on to discord and I was like, oh, it's like a modern IRC fine.

517
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,760
 You know, you get on with it.

518
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,480
 And a day later, I've got the hang of it apart from working out how I could get like

519
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,320
 animated emoji or something.

520
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,200
 But what punctuation made extremely clear was that not everyone, not everyone

521
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,240
 finds it the same, not everyone and found it straightforward to use.

522
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,120
 And it was quite off putting to some people.

523
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,520
 So I think you're right and that we do need some lead up to know how things are

524
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,840
 going to work. And the earlier you get it, the earlier people can start, you know,

525
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,920
 working out if they can even log in, working out if it breaks on their phone,

526
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,800
 tablets, you know, Unix box from the 1970s, whatever they might be using to log into

527
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,760
 it. And the early you tell people what you're using, the early they can sort of

528
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,240
 fix all their teething problems because whatever platform we're using, I assume

529
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,160
 there are going to be some teething problems.

530
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,560
 I just really said what John said, but in more words, right.

531
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,720
 So I'm going to say a few things that are different, I think.

532
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,080
 So one of them is that there is a thread on Joth, which is the journeyman of

533
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:10,800
 Joth, which is a Facebook group, which we'll link to where somebody whose name

534
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,960
 temporarily escapes me, asked, Hey, guys, what's the state of the art in?

535
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,720
 I'm paraphrasing here. Hey, guys, what's the state of the art in con running

536
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,560
 platforms? And in the subsequent discussion, about a dozen platforms that I

537
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,440
 had not previously heard of are mentioned.

538
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,720
 So at some point, it's probably necessary to go and have a look at what all of those

539
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:37,840
 are going to do. My experience of Boscode is that the single sign on is lovely,

540
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,800
 knowing that there is one place you go and it goes, Oh, yes, your Alison, you're

541
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,040
 registered. It's great. Love that bit.

542
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,760
 It's not quite doing what I wanted to do for chat, but I feel like that getting

543
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,320
 the chat working is an easier problem than getting the video conferencing working.

544
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,400
 So that feels quite good. I would like to.

545
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:07,280
 I do think there's a lot further to go in this direction, but trying to making

546
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,880
 making the point where you enter the convention seamless clearly solves a whole

547
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,720
 big set of problems. And I think that's quite nice.

548
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,280
 And I would like to know what Easter comes up to, but I'm sure everyone would.

549
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,680
 And we've been promised a video, which if we're lucky might come out before before

550
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,560
 we see this. So, so that would be good.

551
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,360
 I they did have one.

552
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,560
 They've had one video already, which is a discussion between

553
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,920
 Vanessa May and I guess head of tech, Keith Smith.

554
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,440
 And they kind of told us how marvelous it would be and that we should all join.

555
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,280
 But they didn't actually say anything about the technology apart from that it

556
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,720
 wasn't zoom and discord, which kind of worries people who've been using zoom

557
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,880
 and discord and kind of got the hang of that.

558
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,640
 So, so yeah, so I guess that last bit was yes, I also agree with John.

559
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,200
 It's going to take time to get people used to this.

560
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,600
 But there's probably a discussion about this going over in their discord, which I

561
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,160
 confess I have not been to recently.

562
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,960
 So I should probably check there.

563
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,000
 I asked in the information desk on their discord kind of when we could expect to

564
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,960
 hear more about this platform.

565
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,960
 Mostly like, you know, I am excited to see what they're doing because if it is

566
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,800
 something that does let you do things that is better than the zoom and discord,

567
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,480
 then that is fabulous and I am really looking forward to seeing it in action.

568
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:36,000
 And they did in that response say that the next video will have more concrete

569
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,880
 details and I think the intention is for that to come out before we release.

570
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,000
 So, so yes, hopefully by the time you listen to this, we will have found out and

571
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,040
 it will be it will be clear and we can discuss that on the next episode of

572
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,040
 Oct though. It's very nice to just put these videos out.

573
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,040
 But, you know, if they put the videos out one at a time, then it generates lots

574
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,760
 of content, fault to thought. So that's very, very nice.

575
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,440
 The really yes, and we can discuss all of their decisions in detail and what we

576
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,520
 think about them, which is I think good for everyone for us.

577
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,760
 May not be good for everyone.

578
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,320
 I can hear some little meows.

579
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,000
 Yeah, sorry, Quentin is, Quentin is pretty convinced that people should be

580
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 playing with him. And so if you hear meowing on the on the podcast listeners,

581
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,240
 then that is a very sad cat who is resenting the fact that both of his

582
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,720
 cat parents are doing fanak at the moment and not doing catak.

583
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:40,720
 That was East Carolina. We've done Bosco and we've done baby beans.

584
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,160
 So it's on to the hugos, I think.

585
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:51,120
 So last episode, I went away from a recording fully convinced that John and

586
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,840
 Liz both watched The Vast of Night, which is a low budget science fiction

587
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:00,840
 movie on Amazon Prime that was that got a kind of selection into the.

588
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,800
 There's a thing in the hugos where

589
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,040
 works which were technically released in the wrong year, but only got a very

590
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,720
 limited distribution, get kind of bumped into Hugo.

591
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,680
 Eligibility through a special clause at the business meeting and there were a set

592
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,440
 of items that this was done for that included the Vast of Night.

593
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,640
 There is a digression here, which is that I think that the Hugo people who do

594
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,520
 Hugo things should be thinking about how that can be made automatic.

595
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,200
 So that rather than say we have to have a list of these things, so something has

596
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,000
 been noticed as falling into this category by the time of the Worldcon.

597
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,280
 We can automatically say that something that was only available to a very small

598
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,160
 proportion of the world's population automatically gets a second shout if nobody

599
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,680
 had heard of it until Amazon picked up the distribution for it.

600
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,200
 All that sort of thing.

601
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,560
 So the Vast of Night got picked up by Amazon

602
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,240
 distribution and is available on Amazon Prime and cost $700,000 to make.

603
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,680
 And as a result, it kind of gets a bit graded on a curve because there are a number

604
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,680
 of cases when you're watching the film where you think if they had had more money,

605
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,960
 this would be a slightly better film.

606
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,720
 But I went away thoroughly believing that John and Liz had watched it.

607
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,720
 So I watched it and then I listened to the edited, but not quite ready to put out

608
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,520
 version of OptiThump and realised that they had not watched it.

609
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,120
 And I was completely wrong about that.

610
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:34,440
 So it's a great example of the syndrome of false memories or as or Alison not paying

611
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,880
 attention, as we call it.

612
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,320
 It's quite a good film.

613
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,920
 I would not be unhappy to see it on a Hugo ballot.

614
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,600
 I think it is quite slight.

615
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,880
 I think it's a subtle though.

616
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,640
 It is obviously a science fiction film.

617
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,200
 It's actual science fiction content is quite small.

618
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,600
 It is using the trappings of science fiction to tell a story that is not about

619
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,360
 science fiction.

620
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,720
 Primarily, it is primarily a story about

621
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,320
 alienation in ways that are not necessarily science fictional and it is it is well

622
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,400
 watching, go and see it on your Amazon.

623
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,960
 If you have Amazon Prime, if not, go and watch something else.

624
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,280
 Don't get Amazon just to watch this movie.

625
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,640
 Yeah, agreed.

626
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,400
 I have also watched it since last time.

627
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:23,920
 So and so we have started our Hugo eligible watching.

628
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,160
 And I am logging them, as I mentioned earlier, on Letterbox.

629
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:37,120
 So so far this year, Fast Might is the only 2020 SF movie that I've seen.

630
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,200
 I thought it was good.

631
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,800
 I gave it three and a half stars and I gave it a heart.

632
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,160
 We all know what that means.

633
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
 It means I liked it listeners.

634
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,880
 I will say, I think that it is sorry.

635
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,280
 I'm just doing a small visual joke.

636
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,520
 Yeah.

637
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,920
 Now listen to making a heart with her hands and Liz is making an atomly accurate

638
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,360
 and that's an atomically accurate heart with her hands, which I did not know you

639
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,880
 could do and is amazing.

640
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,000
 I'm doing I'm doing mini hearts with my thumb and forefinger mini hearts.

641
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,240
 I thought you were doing the two chambers with like the pipes coming out and like

642
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,320
 ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

643
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,000
 None of this works in a audio medium.

644
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,840
 No, it is it is a good shoestring

645
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,960
 SF movie.

646
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,480
 I did not think it was amazing, but I thought it was solid.

647
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,960
 And ultimately solid original SF in the genre of movies is not something that

648
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,640
 happens often enough for me to set my nose up at it when it does happen and is

649
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,200
 fairly well done.

650
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,040
 I don't think the last night is as good as Palm Springs, which is the other 2020

651
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,840
 SF normal movie that I have seen and which I will be enthusiastically nominating.

652
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:55,600
 And I am going to watch the color out of space later this very day.

653
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,560
 So I will have thoughts about that next time.

654
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,960
 Yes, Palm Springs is coming to Amazon Prime later this year.

655
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,600
 So if you want to save up your Amazon Prime free trial and use it to watch two

656
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,840
 Hugo eligible movies both at once, then you might be able to do that.

657
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,600
 Although I don't know whether Palm Springs comes out in time,

658
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
 denominations, I don't think there's an actual data attached to it yet.

659
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,200
 So what was the other film?

660
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,800
 The color out of space, which is the Nicholas Cage Lovecraft movie is eligible.

661
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,440
 It was extended at the business meeting.

662
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,840
 So we will be watching that later today.

663
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
 It's supposed to be very good.

664
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,040
 And what and what streaming service is might we get that one on?

665
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,920
 I believe that's also Amazon Prime.

666
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,120
 I think as usual outside the UK, your mileage may vary because a lot of stuff,

667
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:46,720
 which is on Netflix or Amazon Prime is on the other service in different countries.

668
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,240
 And that's all I really have to say because I haven't actually watched the

669
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,560
 best of night or the color out of space or Palm Springs.

670
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,640
 Oh, and I've watched Wonder Woman 84 as well.

671
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
 That's eligible.

672
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,680
 We haven't watched that either.

673
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,520
 But we did discuss that last time.

674
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,560
 We did.

675
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,640
 I will say if you but also if you subscribe to Amazon Prime, then you can watch the

676
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
 Expanse, which is also Hugo eligible.

677
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,560
 Although I don't know if you still have to subscribe to Netflix to watch the earlier

678
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,440
 seasons, if you haven't already caught on them.

679
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,320
 Yeah, I have a problem with the Expanse, which is I have to watch five seasons as

680
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,080
 this, don't I?

681
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,000
 See previous episodes and TV.

682
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,080
 Yes, this is this is a this is a thing we can

683
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,720
 relitigate until the cows come home.

684
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,000
 But yeah, I think I think it is very clear, Alison, you don't wear

685
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,120
 a much lighter version, which is fine, but like we quite like

686
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,640
 television.

687
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,880
 So that's different.

688
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,440
 The expanse is that my friends list has been I nobody spoilt, but my friends

689
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,560
 this has been full of oh my god, the end of the fifth season of the expanse.

690
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,480
 Oh my god, that's amazing, which I think is I bought it.

691
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,760
 It's a hot spot because I'm so clearly there is something about the end of season

692
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,320
 five that is that has astonished and and amazed everybody.

693
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,040
 And I'm like, that would be like 60 hours.

694
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,080
 Yeah, it would be 60 hours to get that point.

695
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,360
 So I can see a problem.

696
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,640
 I assume the end of sea I send I.

697
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,800
 But I assume the big thing that happens at the end of series five is what I think

698
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,040
 is I'm not watched series five, I've read the books, which is obviously cheating.

699
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,480
 Oh, so there are books like so I could like read books because that would not be 60

700
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,640
 hours. Well, there's nine very large space opera books.

701
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,720
 Who wrote the James S.A.

702
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,360
 Corey, who is actually two people and one of them is Daniel Abraham, whose books

703
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,960
 you may have read in terms of reading since last time I have read The Doors of Eden,

704
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,320
 which is an Adrian Tchaikovsky book, which is eligible for a Hugo Award.

705
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,160
 And I enjoyed it.

706
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,080
 It was a little bit long, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

707
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,480
 I have less patients for long books than some other people.

708
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,160
 But I still enjoyed it despite the fact it was quite long.

709
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,480
 It does take a while to work out what's going on, but in a kind of pleasant,

710
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,000
 I wonder what's going on sort of a way.

711
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,040
 So that's quite nice, actually.

712
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,200
 What else have I read that's eligible?

713
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,400
 I've read Harrow the Ninth, which is the sequel to Gideon the Ninth.

714
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,400
 I really enjoyed Harrow the Ninth, but it was not clear to me what on earth was

715
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,120
 going on until about 70% of the way through the book.

716
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,480
 That does seem like quite an adventurous choice, like to have it just really made

717
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,760
 not a lot of sense for most of it.

718
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,200
 And I kind of want to go back and reread it now that I know what was going on,

719
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,600
 but equally I've got a lot of other books to read.

720
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,680
 So yeah, but I did enjoy it.

721
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,160
 I'm not sure it was as good as Gideon the Ninth.

722
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,760
 I don't know whether it'll end up on the ballot.

723
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,400
 And I'm currently reading The Ministry for the Future, which makes me very angry

724
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,320
 in the way that Kim Stanley Robinson does when he is at his best.

725
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,120
 It's an odd book, but I am enjoying it.

726
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,080
 I don't know if it'll end up on the ballot because it is an odd book,

727
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,840
 structurally, very strange.

728
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,600
 I would say I do have a soft spot for books that you read and then, you know,

729
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,680
 something happens late on in the book that would put the whole of the beginning

730
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,240
 in a different perspective.

731
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,080
 I kind of like books where, you know, you there's a value from rereading them

732
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,600
 because you get something different out of them, but you do have to temper that

733
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,920
 with, yeah, you can't be completely opaque and mysterious for 70% of the book,

734
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,480
 or I am going to be annoyed by the time you reveal things unless it's really,

735
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,080
 really good.

736
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,800
 I mean, like I said, I did really enjoy it.

737
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,400
 So yeah, there is that, but I don't know.

738
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,640
 Your mileage may vary.

739
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,120
 Yeah, because I quite enjoyed Gideon the Ninth, but I wasn't completely

740
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,760
 out by it.

741
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,040
 And so everything I've heard about Harro the Ninth makes me not want to

742
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,600
 immediately rush out and read it.

743
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,920
 That makes sense.

744
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,120
 Unless I would really like it because it's different than

745
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,320
 the Ninth.

746
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,000
 This is very complicated.

747
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,560
 It is different because it's all from it's from Harro's very different point

748
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,680
 of view character to Gideon.

749
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,880
 So yeah, yeah.

750
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,400
 Yep.

751
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,360
 Anyway, what books have you guys read?

752
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:58,840
 I read the space between worlds by Micaiah Johnson,

753
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,480
 which is really interesting premise.

754
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,480
 So it's set in a world where we have discovered parallel universes and we can

755
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,720
 travel to the parallel worlds which are closest to our own in terms of kind

756
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,120
 of divergence from our own.

757
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,720
 But the twist is you can only travel to a world where your like

758
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,040
 doppelganger in that world is not alive.

759
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,160
 And so the people who travel between worlds are essentially the people who

760
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,040
 have been most likely to die in their other lives and send it with this kind

761
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:32,280
 of interesting set up where there's a rich city and a much poorer town on the

762
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,840
 outskirts of the city and it's people from that much poorer town who get pulled

763
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,360
 through the traveling between worlds and because a lot of their other selves have

764
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,400
 died.

765
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,280
 It does really interesting things about like privilege and how in fact the most

766
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,840
 privileged in the society can't travel between worlds.

767
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,200
 It goes into a lot of stuff about kind of your other selves that have taken

768
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,640
 different paths and what they could have become and what people become with

769
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,600
 different opportunities.

770
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,960
 It took a bit of getting into because it does quite a lot of telling you what's

771
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,520
 going on at the start, I feel.

772
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,920
 But then there's a few sort of little reveals about maybe 25% the way in that

773
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,320
 had me going, oh, that's what's going on.

774
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,280
 And then it gets really interesting.

775
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,720
 And I think it's kind of it's a standalone book that is very satisfying

776
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,360
 ending both in plot terms and also kind of in

777
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,320
 kind of in character terms or the characters get to a point which is really

778
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,560
 satisfying and interesting.

779
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,960
 So yeah, I liked it.

780
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,320
 It is probably on my Hugo ballot at the moment.

781
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,200
 I still got a lot of other books left to read, but I think I will probably

782
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,280
 eliminate that one.

783
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,760
 I am reading a lot of books and only a few of them are genre and none of them

784
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,480
 Hugo eligible and none of the books I've finished in the last two weeks are

785
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,320
 Hugo eligible.

786
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,440
 I kind of go must do better, but I think probably because I'm reading

787
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,440
 primarily from the library, I'm never ever going to be able to read books

788
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,120
 early enough to nominate them for Hugo.

789
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,240
 So yeah, well, I've just in TV terms, I have finished the Queen's Gambit,

790
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,200
 which is definitely not eligible for Hugo.

791
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,920
 It probably gets the nominations anyway, but is based on a book by Walter

792
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,800
 Tevis, who is, of course, a genre writer or was a genre writer as well,

793
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,680
 and which like the dig is one of these things that loads and loads of people who

794
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,640
 are science fiction fans are also watching because it it's kind of genre

795
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,520
 adjacent in a weird sort of way despite actually having no genre content whatsoever

796
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:33,240
 apart from, you know, chess, science fiction fans are interested in chess.

797
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,480
 Because it's a game for those more interested.

798
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,040
 Check out Shut Up Sit Down's recent chess month, which was very interesting.

799
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,040
 There's a link you can buy expansions for chess, though.

800
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,520
 I think it was Steve Jackson games who wrote an expansion for chess that adds

801
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,680
 you have a hand of cards and they let you make your pieces do strange things.

802
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,040
 So that's good.

803
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,760
 That was the 25th episode of the ultra thought podcast and it's goodbye from me.

804
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,400
 It's goodbye from more.

805
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,600
 And it's goodbye from me.

806
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:24,560
 You haven't mentioned the letter of

807
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,080
 commentary received from Basgar who centers his uncensored bodybuilding newsletter.

808
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,400
 And so thank you very much for that, Basgar.

809
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,080
 I have clicked unsubscribe with great prejudice.

810
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:41,920
 So sorry, do we have to unsubscribe from

811
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,480
 Basgar's uncensored bodybuilding newsletter?

812
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,720
 I mean, it's a spam email.

813
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,760
 So I think unsubscribe, which just means you get more, doesn't it?

814
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,480
 But I don't know.

815
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,240
 No, I'd so I so I did unsubscribe and it's MailChimp.

816
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,560
 And so he's abusing MailChimp.

817
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,480
 And so I clicked on subscribe and clicked the we did not sign up to his mailing

818
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,560
 list in the hope that his MailChimp gets limited or something.

819
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,120
 Hey, sorry, Basgar.

820
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,200
 I'm slightly worried about this because I

821
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,240
 I am forever unsubscribing from MailChimp email mailing list because I didn't sign up

822
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,200
 to them and it's not it.

823
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,240
 They are legitimate mailing list where somebody in America believes that their

824
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,320
 email address is my email address because I have a very common name.

825
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:19,880
 Yes.

826
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,560
 And if you are the American listener listening, whose name is OctaThaw cast,

827
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,880
 please do stop using our email address.

828
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,720
 It is not your email address.

829
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,920
 It's very annoying.

830
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,640
 So what what I assume will happen is if you know,

831
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,800
 0.1% of Basgar subscribers click, I never signed up to this.

832
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,600
 It'll be fine if 50% keep saying I never signed up to this.

833
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,880
 Then yeah, they might tell him knock it off.

834
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,080
 So we'll see this podcast will end at the beep.

835
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,080
 beep
