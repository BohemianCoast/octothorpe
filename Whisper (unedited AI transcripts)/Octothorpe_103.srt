00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hello listeners, John here, just before we start, Liz was using the wrong microphone,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,680
 and so I am aware she is in a cave. I apologise for her being in a cave,

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,920
 she will not be in a cave next week. That was the Octothorpe podcast, and it's goodbye from me.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,680
 [splutter] I'm still eating a muffin, that was very quick, hang on. You were not expecting the end of the podcast after you

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,920
 finished your last pick. Nobody expects the end of the podcast. That's why we give them the beep.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:50,880
 [music] Hello everyone, and welcome to the very 103rd episode of Octothorpe. A podcast for

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,320
 science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is winging its way to you on the 15th of February

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:04,560
 2024, just in time for that post-Valentine's Day lull. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott.

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,920
 And I'm Liz Batty. And speaking of Valentine's Day, we have some letters of comment, and one of

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,600
 them is from Christopher J. Garcia. Hurrah. Who I think we can all agree is the Cupid of Science Fiction

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,760
 fandom. [laughs] He says that this is the best of all episode art, and he was not wrong, it was pretty

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,800
 dang good. And Raj wrote in on Mastodon to say, "Bohemiancoast, do you happen to have a gallery

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,360
 or something somewhere with your cover art for Octothorpe and other fan art? I'd like to find

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,880
 examples I can provide for Hugo nomination purposes." So, Alison, do you have a website?

15
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,160
 It is great that you should say that, because I do in fact have a website, which is called something

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,360
 like alisonscottfanart.myportfolio.com. I don't know if that's exactly right, but we will definitely

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,880
 put the real link in the show notes, and I just got ambushed with that query, so thanks for that.

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,440
 Yay! Thanks for everyone who said lovely things about the cover, because yeah, no, I had spent two full

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,520
 weeks giggling about it before I actually delivered it, so. Yes. But thanks for your lovely letter,

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,760
 Chris. He did say, "The thing I find so disheartening is that a member of the Hugo subcommittee flat-out

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,800
 said she knew that votes were thrown out due to a slate and no one seems to care."

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,920
 I've heard this as a rumour, but I've not seen anything written down that says it or anything on

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,920
 the record, so if you are out there and you have this report, if you'd like to report it to us in

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,200
 a bit more cogent way so that we could talk about it, we'd love that. Thank you.

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:45,040
 If it's true, it's very damning. Is it â€“ so Chris does say there's no more perfect description of

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,760
 Dave than arrogant, haughty, and insolent, and I'm going to have to start using that, and I am slightly

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,120
 regretting that I've already put my ribbon order in for Gallifrey 1, but at Glasgow, will there be

28
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,080
 ribbons that say arrogant, haughty, and insolent? I could definitely make one. Also, there is no more

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,320
 perfect description of Dave than arrogant, haughty, and insolent, but what about Hugo Pope?

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,440
 I mean, I'm definitely considering cosplaying as the Hugo Pope.

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,880
 Oh my god, and Hugo Boss, apparently, Dave McCarty, for those who have not heard this, was

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,960
 signing autographs at Chengdu with the words Hugo Boss.

33
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,160
 Which, fun fact, is not something that a member of the Mark Protection Committee should ever do,

34
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,480
 because there have been letters exchanged with Hugo Boss about the Hugo trademarks.

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,600
 So firstly, there's only one Hugo Boss, and it's a clothing company, and secondly, there's only one

36
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,960
 Hugo Boss, and it's a comedian called Joe Lycett, and thirdly, Dave McCarty is the boss of precisely

37
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,840
 nothing except for bad decisions. And fourthly, we don't have a Hugo Boss, because we did have a

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,080
 Hugo Boss, it's likely that none of this would ever have happened. If Dave McCarty is the Hugo Pope,

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,760
 then Nicholas Whyte should be the Hugo God. Hugo Cardinal. Chris also says Liz does need to offer

40
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,280
 her services as vote rigger for all sorts of awards. Liz, are you available on commission?

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
 What are your rates? [laughs]

42
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,600
 I actually want to say Nicholas, Nicholas, please, please write in with your preferred

43
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,280
 Hugo title, and then we'll use it in future. Hugo Messiah, perhaps?

44
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,600
 Hugo Tsar, perhaps? Yeah. Really, whatever it, whatever you would like. [laughs]

45
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,440
 Mark Plummer of Croydon wrote to us and said, "This is not a comment on Octothorpe 102,

46
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:39,280
 as I haven't listened to it yet." Did you know that Liz's entry in ISFDb contains a note saying,

47
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,840
 "Perhaps a thinly disguised pseudonym for a person called Elizabeth?"

48
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,200
 [dramatic music] Liz, did you know this? [laughs]

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,760
 I can reveal exclusively on this podcast that yes, it is a very thinly disguised pseudonym. In

50
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,960
 fact, some would not even call it a pseudonym, but maybe just a nickname?

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,840
 I figured this out. Actually someone pointed it out to me a few months ago, and one,

52
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,280
 I was surprised I had an ISFDB entry, but apparently I do for doing some layout for Vector years ago.

53
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:15,680
 But also, I realised ISFDB are very obsessed with properly naming, listing all possible pseudonyms,

54
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,080
 alternative names, etc. To the point where they do do some really weird and quite unwarranted stuff,

55
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,840
 I think. For example, Lee Mandello, who has changed name, is listed under their previous name,

56
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,600
 and I think they've only just managed to get it changed to list their correct name. If you look

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,760
 up the author, S L Huang, it says, "Legal name removed at author's request." And if you look up

58
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,320
 some other authors who have changed name, then it lists everything that they wrote under their

59
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,680
 previous names, even in cases where they've maybe been republished under their new name.

60
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
 It's just weird. Right? It's just trying to be super-completist about publication, but not really thinking that

61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,320
 there's a actual person here who maybe does not want to be reminded every time someone looks up

62
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,560
 their ISFDB page that they had a previous name. I mean, in my case, this is a nickname and I do

63
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,280
 not care, but it is a bit kind of... It seems to have improved a bit, but this is something I think

64
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,560
 people are not aware of. I think the obsession with pseudonyms dates from a time when a lot of

65
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,560
 science fiction authors wrote under a vast number of different names in order to sell multiple stories

66
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,840
 in the same month to magazines. So obviously, at that point, a lot of people did a tonne of

67
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,960
 very painstaking work to work out who all of these pseudonyms are, and they've kind of forgotten that

68
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,840
 actually there are lots of other reasons why you might not use your complete legal name to

69
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,720
 write fiction or do whatever else you do in the science fiction space. And you certainly

70
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,040
 might not want your previous names to be included. So, you know...

71
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,840
 I will say, Liz, that this, combined with the vote fixing, it's really starting to look bad for you.

72
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,080
 [Laughter]

73
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,880
 It is. I'm never going to be a Hugo administrator now.

74
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,480
 Have you now, or... when did you stop rigging votes, Liz?

75
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:06,880
 We also heard from DC, who had caught up with Octothorpe. We've not heard from DC for a while.

76
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,400
 Thank you very much for writing in DC, and they say that the phrase "useful idiots" was

77
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,360
 pinging around in their head as well. So, yeah, it's a very useful, very useful term for what is

78
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,920
 going on, I think. And DC also thanks Liz for the work in looking at the stats, and congratulations

79
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,600
 us on our hundredth episode. We do have to protect Lenin's honour. It turns out the phrase "useful idiot"

80
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,800
 comes from American newspapers in the 40s and 50s, probably, because I did some... I fell down an

81
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,080
 internet rabbit hole after editing that podcast, but it is a very useful phrase, regardless.

82
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
 So yes, thank you for writing in DC.

83
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
 Lenin's probably okay at this point.

84
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
 That's going to be the episode title.

85
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,000
 He's probably not listening.

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,480
 [Laughter]

87
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,000
 Uh, Liz, do you want to do some Blueskys?

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,640
 We will do some Blueskys. I should say that I have...

89
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,040
 Is it pronounced... So, I listened to a stream and somewhat called it blue ski.

90
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
 It cannot be pronounced blue ski, can it?

91
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,880
 I don't pronounce it blue ski. I'm going to pronounce it blue sky, but if you want to

92
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
 pronounce it blue ski, you know...

93
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,840
 Okay, good.

94
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
 I'm casual about it. I'm going to call it blue sky though. I should say that I have the keys to

95
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,720
 the Bluesky account, and somehow I managed to post the wrong link to the podcast last time.

96
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,760
 So apologies, thank you to everyone who pointed that out. This is not like, you know, learned

97
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,840
 competence so someone else does the Bluesky, I'm going to get it right. Thank you to Kevin from

98
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,360
 Hugo, Girl!, who commented, say it was nice to hear people say that, you know, the Hugo is still

99
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,280
 something to be proud of, as they are 2023 winners. So thank you very much, Kevin.

100
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:50,720
 And Robot Archie, who is also Martin, does comment to say that a Worldcon bid being initiated

101
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,800
 by enthusiastic but inexperienced fans and then taken over by those with more business and

102
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,880
 organisation experience is far from unknown in the West. I think that may be true. I don't know,

103
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,600
 I don't go far enough back into Worldcon bid history to have been personally involved with

104
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
 one of them, but it does seem plausible that some people enthusiastically start one and then have to be

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,240
 rescued by people who actually know how to organise things. But in this case, it seems like it really

106
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,720
 was business experience in that, you know, they were doing business, not that they were taking

107
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,000
 their business experience and using it to run Worldcons, but they were running the Worldcon a bit

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,080
 more like a business. I don't know, yeah, I don't know whether this has ever happened in a Western

109
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,600
 convention that was not a Worldcon, but certainly I do not think this has ever happened in quite this

110
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,720
 way in a Western Worldcon. I think there is a difference here.

111
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,680
 Yes, I mean, not like this, not like this. And also it had already been taken over by big business

112
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,000
 at the time of the vote. Let's be clear here. The people who run it were the people who

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,400
 engineered all the streams and making sure that lots and lots and lots of Chinese SF fans

114
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,680
 were involved. That was all done by Science Fiction World.

115
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,000
 I will also note that if this happened with a US con, we'd also be angry about it,

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,720
 or a Western con, I should say, like look at how much criticism there was of Raytheon

117
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,800
 sponsoring the Hugos. We are not shy about letting Worldcons know in the West when we feel

118
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,840
 their corporate influences have been unsuitable and there have been a lot of times where fandom

119
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,880
 has reacted very strongly to that. So I don't, I will also say, I think if the same thing happened

120
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,840
 in a Western con, we would be having very similar conversations.

121
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,360
 Oh, yes. I just want to say this isn't really a letter of comment, but I just wanted to give

122
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,160
 a shout out and a thank you to Mike Glyer from File 770 when we were putting together the links

123
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,640
 for the show notes in the last episode. I emailed Mike to ask whether he would mind

124
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,920
 tweaking a File 770 post to make it a better roundup of what was going on for our show notes.

125
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,200
 And he extremely kindly obliged. And he did not have to do that. So thank you very much to Mike.

126
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,160
 And obviously we linked to File 770 a lot in the show notes. And we mentioned it a lot on the pod,

127
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,560
 but I don't think we ever necessarily sing its praises. It's real good guys.

128
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,920
 I think the fact that the amount we're relying on File 770 is a good indication of

129
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,880
 File 770's criticality to the genre at times like this and what a lot of good work Mike and

130
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,400
 his team have been doing. Yeah. And especially when stuff is split across streams and, you know,

131
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,120
 the last remnants of Twitter and then bits of Bluesky and bits of Mastodon and bits of blogs,

132
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,240
 you know, it is good to have somewhere that kind of if you just read File 770, you'll basically know

133
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,520
 what's going on. File 770 pretty great website. Ali Baker Brooks wrote to us to say, I am now

134
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,880
 Octothorpe complete with your latest episode. So well done, Ali. And I'm just going to remind

135
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,200
 people that you do not have to listen to all of them. There are 102 of them. That's quite a lot.

136
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,800
 You don't have to, but it does give me the warm fuzzies, whatever someone says they have.

137
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,520
 But there's no obligation, but it is nice though. Thank you, Ali.

138
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,720
 Yeah, I mean, if you want to give John the warm fuzzies, this is a way to do it.

139
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,240
 Farah writes to say, I agree with Liz on the gifts. One week we could shine with my university

140
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,760
 as I had to either buy a new suitcase or just abandon things. Farah left the paperweight and

141
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,160
 the framed artwork behind. Yeah, it was a framed print of Dave McCarty.

142
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:22,240
 I guess that's getting cut, but I still think it's funny. Liz has given us a Look. Also on Facebook,

143
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,760
 Ming says, "Pondering a crowd funder for 30 pieces of silver." I didn't get that. I am bereft.

144
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,400
 It's like Dave McCarty is the Devil, right? Or Judas. I see.

145
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,960
 Okay, that's quite good. Farah also asks whether a collected comic could be included in Best

146
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,160
 Series. And the answer is yes, if it's very, very, very long, I think Liz said. Well, there's a word

147
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,920
 limit. 240,000 words. The minimum number of words for being a Best Series, so it would have to be an extremely

148
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,560
 wordy comic. And I don't know if you can get word counts for comics. And I don't think a picture counts as

149
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,360
 the thousand words for the purposes of Best Series. I think that that's one of these things that's

150
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,240
 been discussed in the past on Hugos. There is a journal called the Journal of Geophysical Research.

151
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:16,320
 And when they were making the change from doing their fees in terms of how many pages it would be

152
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,520
 in the physical journal, they obviously changed that when it became clear that journals were going

153
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,840
 to be primarily PDFs, and so that didn't really make sense as a model. And they decided that they

154
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,440
 would do publication units, and a publication unit was 500 words or one figure. And the editors did

155
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,760
 note "this does of course mean we are devaluing the picture". I thought that was a very good,

156
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:47,520
 very good comment from him. James Shields points out in terms of series that all of the collected

157
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,160
 Judge Dredd strips from 2000 AD are easily going to go over 240,000 words because there's about

158
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,320
 2,400 issues. So you'd only need a hundred words an issues and obviously there's a lot more than

159
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,280
 that. So we're going to be talking about Hugo nominations in a subsequent episode. But you can

160
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,440
 expect to see the collected Judge Dredd from 2000 AD on my Best Series list. All right, so

161
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,880
 I need you guys to do Bat John because it's not often that I'm the one that goes to the

162
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:24,080
 WSFS constitution. [music] Bat John! I think comics are not eligible in Best Series. And I think

163
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,800
 the reason is 3.2.7, which provides that the categories of Best Novel, Novella, Novelette,

164
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,080
 Short Story and Series shall be open to non-interactive works in which text is the primary

165
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,080
 form of communication. And I think it would be argued that in a comic, the text is as important

166
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,440
 as the graphics and is therefore not primary. I think the graphics are also primary, I suppose.

167
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,440
 But I think the intent is that graphic novels are not eligible in any of the Novel,

168
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,720
 Novella, Novellette, Short Story and Series categories. The thing is that if you rule comics

169
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,320
 are eligible for series, I think it also makes them eligible for Short Story, Novellette, Novella,

170
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,760
 and Novel and I think that opens a can of worms. So is my is my belief it must be in Graphic Story.

171
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:17,280
 A can of graphic worms? Oh, I'm going to write a massive series entirely comprised of ASCII art now.

172
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,240
 [laughs][ Well, and also like it is the sort of thing where I can see a Hugo administrator... If there was an

173
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,240
 overwhelming will of the voters, I don't know what you'd do, but it would be interesting.

174
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,360
 I feel like Hugo Messiah, Nicholas Whyte, would let the overwhelming will of the voters have its way.

175
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,000
 Yeah, if the Hugo Holy Ghost, Nicholas Whyte could write in and let us know what hisâ€“ oh, he can't

176
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,080
 this year because he's actually the Hugo administrator, right? I think Big Hugo Banana is his official

177
00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:02,080
 job title. So we won't be offended if the Hugo Zaphod Beeblebrox does not write in and tell us what

178
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,960
 the skinny is here because it might be a conflict of interest. Zaphod Beeblebrox isn't a title

179
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,160
 is it? His title was like president of the universe or something. So if the Hugo president of the universe...

180
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,640
 Nicholas is just this guy, you know?

181
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:21,040
 Oh, that means it all has to stay in. God damn it, Liz.

182
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:36,000
 [music] The BSFA Longlist is out. In fact, it was out two weeks ago, but we were a little bit

183
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,520
 busy with another award having some problems. So we didn't get to it. But basically the BSFA

184
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,240
 Longlist... as I understand that there is now like a multi-stage nomination process. There's a long

185
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,400
 list in which all BSFA members can nominate things to be on the long list. And then there's

186
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,520
 a long list and then you can vote for those things on the long list to be on the short list. And then

187
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,280
 you can vote for the short lists and all the Eastercon members can also vote on the short list. So the

188
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,800
 BSFA put out the long list, which, you know, I'm fine with this as a thing. I think there have

189
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,800
 been cases in the past where the BSFA have not had a lot of nominations in certain categories.

190
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,480
 And so putting out kind of a long list of things people can go and check out and then

191
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,800
 nominate their favourites and then vote on the favourites seems good. But I'm pretty sure what

192
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,200
 they did is they took a big Google Doc or something that people have been dumping their

193
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,240
 long list nominations in and then they just put it onto the internet. And I think they could have

194
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,600
 maybe done a bit of editing first? Because for instance there's quite a lot of errors.

195
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,120
 They probably do need to do a certain amount of eligibility checking before posting.

196
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,120
 There's quite a lot of errors in it. The things like there's quite a lot of misspelled names,

197
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,200
 which is just... it's not good for if you turn up on the long list and your name is spelled wrong.

198
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,560
 There's some things that possibly are eligible but in the wrong category. And so they could really

199
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,640
 do with being moved before all lots of people nominate them and then you have to move them later,

200
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,720
 things like that. And something we should remember for next year, which is that the BSFA

201
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,200
 long list in order to get things on the long list, you have to remember to read your BSFA email

202
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,840
 at exactly the right time and then vote before the end of the year, which is really unusual for

203
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,920
 awards. Normally awards nominations happen at the beginning of the new year rather than

204
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,600
 on 31st of December because 31st of December is too early, right? Because stuff could still be

205
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,280
 being published. I've known in practice not very much is published between in the last two weeks

206
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,040
 of December but it could be and it should get its fair shout at eligibility.

207
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,080
 Mmm, that is true. I think it's just kind of compressed time-wise because they've got to do all this

208
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,840
 process before the Eastercon which this year is March. Yes but they could still ask for the

209
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,320
 long list by the middle of January instead of the end of December. Right. The long list is out.

210
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,840
 If you are a BSFA member you can now go and vote and move things onto the short list. There are

211
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,920
 new categories this year. I think they generally did want to sort of split their short fiction

212
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,480
 category but I don't quite... it was not clear to me what is best short fiction and what is best

213
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,720
 shorter fiction. There's also a best short non-fiction category. There is still

214
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,320
 a best fiction for younger readers category which only has eight items in which means that could be

215
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,600
 literally eight people and then it goes through to a short list of five. Probably could be one person.

216
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,040
 Can only put so many things on the long list. I can't remember how many. It doesn't say there is a

217
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,440
 ton of interest in this which is unusual because there is a lot of YA out there and you know the

218
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,000
 Lodestar is showing there is a bunch of stuff but obviously it's not quite caught on among the BSFA

219
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,600
 members. But anyway if you are a BSFA member go, have a look, read things, nominate them.

220
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,760
 I'm wondering whether a learned person who listens to this podcast and who knows about children's

221
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,680
 literature could provide recommendations to the BSFA voting membership about what they might

222
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,480
 want to read from a given year because I don't really have a very good view of any of this at all

223
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,480
 and so I think having that would be helpful, and I'm not mentioning any names, Ali.

224
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,520
 Oh so you mean someone who consistently listens to this podcast? [laughs]

225
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:04,080
 That was the BSFA awards. Obviously the thing you all need to vote for is All These Worlds:

226
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,680
 Reviews and Essays by Neil Harrison.

227
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:20,080
 Okay so next up on our list this week is fan funds and we have three fan funds and they are at

228
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:27,680
 slightly different stages of happeningness. So TAFF is running a race from North America to Europe

229
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:35,840
 to attend the Glasgow Worldcon and it is happening now and you can vote online or probably by

230
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,240
 other routes as well and there are two candidates who are Vanessa Applegate and Sarah Gulde and

231
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,200
 they are both lovely lovely people and they've put their explanations in and you should go and

232
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,080
 vote for one of them. I kind of like seeing who people's nominators are, so Vanessa has been nominated

233
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:02,240
 by Dave O'Neill, Chuck Serface, Francesca Myman, Alissa Wales and somebody called John

234
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:10,400
 Coxon. Hello there. Sarah has been nominated by Chris Garcia, Seanan McGuire, Kevin Roche,

235
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,600
 James Bacon and Johan Anglemark so I would say that is a good set of nominators on both accounts

236
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,720
 but I think we can probably say that this podcast is supporting Vanessa, can we? We don't have any

237
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:28,400
 strong reasons not to say that. This podcast supports TAFF. Yeah. And you should vote for whoever

238
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,280
 you think is best, listener. My nomination probably gives a clue as to which way I am leaning but go!

239
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,440
 Read them. They're both great people. I've worked with them both on fanish endeavors. They would both

240
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,240
 be extremely good TAFF delegates. I will be voting for Vanessa in one and Sarah in two. Hopefully one

241
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,200
 of those people will be at the Worldcon. They've started an EFF race. This is the European Fan Fund

242
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:01,120
 which will bring a lucky European fan to the Eurocon which is in Rotterdam in mid-August this year.

243
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:11,680
 The candidates here are Jane Mondrup and Joro Penchev, Jane I think lives in Denmark and Euro comes

244
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,760
 from Bulgaria. They're both great candidates I think though in this case I do not know either

245
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:25,280
 of them so it's the other way around from the TAFF race. I agree with Alison. And on GUFF,

246
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,480
 GUFF have issued a call for candidates. GUFF is going to bring somebody from Australia or New

247
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:40,560
 Zealand or the Pacific Islands I guess, that sort of area, to the Glasgow Worldcon and we'll have a

248
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,440
 link to that call for nomination. So if you are in that part of the world and you would like a free

249
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:53,040
 trip to the UK then do not under any circumstances self-exclude. This is a great opportunity. I love

250
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,080
 doing GUFF and people should get their nominations in. We like Fan Funds, Fan Funds are good.

251
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:12,400
 [music] So a committee has been formed to bring the 85th Worldcon to Montreal, Canada in 2027.

252
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,840
 Yeah it's basically looks to be many of the same people as did 2009 I think? Although we don't

253
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,520
 really know who they all are yet they don't have a website... Oh, no, they do have a website

254
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,120
 ignore me. They do have a website, it just doesn't have the names on it.

255
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,040
 All right they do have a website. It's led by Terry Fong who has been involved in lots of

256
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,880
 Canadian conventions. They plan to use the same venue as 2009 which I think everyone liked.

257
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:48,000
 Yeah and the other bid for 2027 was Tel Aviv so yeah I mean I don't know if they just completely

258
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,680
 give up but I'm pretty sure that Montreal is going to be more popular than Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv is

259
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:00,960
 a more challenging venue now than it was when they first formed that bid. There is an update on the

260
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,640
 Tel Aviv bid website but do me a fairly recent one saying that all members of the committee are safe

261
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,640
 and they're devastated by the recent tax and they basically betting that things will stabilize

262
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,680
 and they will be able to continue but I don't know for how long that is going to seem plausible as

263
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:25,120
 you get closer to the actual 2025 boat. That's true yes. I will also say that all the Montreal

264
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:33,600
 in 2027 pre-sports and so ons have funny names which appeals to me so if you give them $20 you

265
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,360
 can have a nifty ribbon with lemmings you know I like that. Donation only no membership tier really

266
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,200
 you had to do this no lemon ribbon for you you get a black ribbon so there. Okay so I have just

267
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,960
 looked up on one of the tiers is named after an owl. So funny animal tiers we approve

268
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,840
 so well good good luck to them. I really enjoyed Montreal in 2009. I think we need to say

269
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,760
 Pemecon was not an unalloyed success and I think we'll probably walk to ask this bid

270
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,680
 what it's going to be doing to make sure that some of the mistakes Pemecon made are not repeated

271
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:16,560
 in 2027 but nevertheless I think most people would much rather see a Montreal will come

272
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:24,720
 than a Tel Aviv one at the moment. Yes so Montreal and Tel Aviv will be being voted on in Seattle in 2025

273
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,800
 the bid that will be being voted on in Glasgow will be the LA bid for 2026. That bid's currently

274
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:43,120
 unopposed we believe. We were very sorry to hear of the death of Chris Priest since we last recorded

275
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,640
 he was obviously a huge tiring force in British science fiction and really responsible for a lot

276
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,880
 of the more literary SF that was produced as in actually over his fantastic career obviously he

277
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,000
 has some success towards the end of his career with his book The Prestige was picked up by

278
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Christopher Nolan and turned into an excellent movie but but he'd been writing wonderful,

279
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,720
 challenging, thoughtful books for a very very long time. He was also one of the first science

280
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,000
 fiction authors possibly the first science fiction author of any note that I met because he came to

281
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,320
 talk to Gus Uswell I was one of the officers and in fact my flatmate my roommate and I fed him

282
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,400
 breakfast because we put him up in the college but we were the cussus was too cheap to actually

283
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,000
 stand in breakfast at the buttery so we cooked him eggs and bacon in our room which I think seems

284
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,520
 appalling to me now but was kind of just the sort of thing we did back in the 80s sorry Chris.

285
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,160
 For those who are unaware Cussus is the Cambridge Science Fiction Society.

286
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,600
 Cussus Cambridge University Science Fiction Society. I mean whenever John was talking about

287
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,960
 Imperial and how they were perhaps not the most organized I cast my mind back to some terrible

288
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,720
 things that we did when we were students. Oh I mean my my opinion of that came from the same

289
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,400
 when I was a student involved in my student societies like I am not expecting I guess that's

290
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,480
 that's where all that comes from is like I know what I was like and I am not expecting

291
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
 the students of today to be any better than I was.

292
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,880
 No I never met Chris Priest but I did see him on panels at Novacom 50 and at the most recent

293
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,160
 satellite convention where he was against the Waller and he was witty and erudite and incredibly

294
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,840
 grumpy and he was very good to listen to on panels for that reason. Yes I mean he wrote you know a

295
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,160
 whole range of really really good novels I think the time I came into fandom was about the time

296
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,400
 that like everyone was talking about the separation well we'd run the Beers of Fey award and then

297
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,840
 won the clock award it's about the time I was like to pay attention to the clock award I think and

298
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,920
 then I read a lot of his subsequent books filled in a lot of the backstory. The Prestige is a great

299
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,600
 novel as well as being turned into a great film the glamour the information in the inverted world

300
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,040
 this feels completely different to all the rest of them but it's great. He wrote some really really

301
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,400
 good stuff and he was also very intensive and I think he had a reputation for being grumpy maybe

302
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:19,280
 because he was on panels and he was famously very grumpy about the clock award one year. The Glasgow

303
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:25,680
 Worldcon also linked to. Was that the year he wasn't nominated? I think that is a bit harsh but yeah he

304
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,360
 was very commercially about it and he also was on panels and so when I had occasion to email him

305
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,680
 for convention stuff I was always a bit worried that he was going to be really really grumpy and

306
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:42,000
 he was very nice I think it was very much a this is this is the way he exists and he was

307
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,720
 homogeny about the clock award but I think because he genuinely did want to see really great stuff

308
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,520
 nominated for the club award and he felt that that year it was not. I am going to quote from

309
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,240
 the Guardian's article on on Christopher Priest's rant. "The judges should be fired or forced to

310
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,720
 resign," says Priest and the 2012 awards suspended. If his quote, Moss's suggestion is taken up he says

311
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,760
 and enough people believe the proposal was made in his own interest he would then withdraw his own

312
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,400
 novel The Islanders from the running. "That was 11 years ago, good god, 12 years ago."

313
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:24,320
 Absolute Titan of the genre will be sorely sorely missed. The Glasgow Worldcon linked to his 2005

314
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,120
 guest of honor speech a Worldcon which I don't think I don't think I went to that or I missed or

315
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,720
 I haven't remembered but it is it is quite funny because you know what you're going to say about how

316
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,920
 you know the guest of honor and riches Easter Convention gave his speech of mind-knowing

317
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,880
 tediousness and to polite to name him and then like you know to progress later ex-only names

318
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,040
 was Larry Niven and it goes on like that. We're really sad he was one of the possibly the greatest

319
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,040
 British science fiction author and we miss him and it's a shame.

320
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:05,360
 Yeah so for listeners who are unaware the Hugos are a popularly voted award that's given out by a

321
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,680
 convention called the Worldcon. So we're going to start with the trademark kerfuffle. There was

322
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:17,360
 a Twitch stream in which Mike Dunford and Will Frank both of whom are lawyers who specialise in

323
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,560
 sort of intellectual property and trademarks talk about Hugo Awards due to a thing that happened

324
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,080
 on the internet. It's related to but slightly separate from the stuff we discussed last

325
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,960
 episode about Chengdu but it is related to the pickup I put in last episode about Kevin Stanley

326
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,600
 being reprimanded. Effectively Kevin Stanley said at great length on a variety of social media platforms

327
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:50,240
 that there's no way for the mark protection committee to enforce any rules on the Worldcon

328
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:57,360
 who is administering the Hugo Awards. There is a problem when you say that in US trademark law

329
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,920
 and the analogy given in the stream basically goes something like this. We will link to the full

330
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,000
 stream if you want more details because I am not a trademark lawyer. This is my understanding

331
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,360
 of what a trademark lawyer said. So basically if you go to McDonald's you are expecting a certain

332
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,360
 level of service and your personal opinions listener about McDonald's not withstanding.

333
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,880
 So if you go into McDonald's and you order a big Mac you can expect a certain thing to be given to

334
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,840
 you and the thing the trademark basically warrants is that the thing you get is the thing you expect

335
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,440
 to get and so the trademark effectively is to do with your perception of the business and the

336
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,560
 standard of the service the business will provide to you. The problem is that that mechanism requires

337
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,640
 the company that controls the trademark to be able to take the trademark away if the quality of the

338
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,120
 service rendered is subpar and if the owner of the trademark publicly says repeatedly that they

339
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,360
 have no mechanism with which to do that they invalidate their trademarks under US trademark law because

340
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:08,480
 that is a key part of US trademark law and so by saying all of this Kevin might have inadvertently

341
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:16,160
 opened the Hugo's up to legal challenges. The reason that's the case is because if you do something

342
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:23,440
 that you suspect might get you sued in the US you can sue first. So you can basically sue to say

343
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,960
 we think we might get sued and we want to sue to establish that the thing we are doing we can't be

344
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,120
 sued for and so if someone starts awarding a Hugo award they could sue Worldcon Intellectual

345
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,640
 Property Inc preemptively basically saying we think you might sue us but you don't have standing to

346
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,120
 sue us so we can sue you first. Basically if someone does start awarding Hugo awards they could

347
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,720
 preemptively sue and then win a case that says we can award our own Hugo awards because the trademark

348
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,240
 is null. That is my understanding of the Twitch Street. Liz do you have any things that you think

349
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,760
 I have misrepresented or got wrong in my capacity as definitely not a lawyer? No because I would say

350
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,440
 I am also definitely not a lawyer. I didn't finish the entire stream but that does appear to be the

351
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,160
 gist is that like there are multiple things involved in having service marks or trademarks and there's

352
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,360
 lots of bits I wasn't aware of that you kind of should be doing. I would also say that like I've

353
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,960
 followed Mike Dunford on Twitter, Blue Sky, whatever for a while and so you know I think a good goal

354
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,480
 even life is to not do something which is legally so deaf that Mike Dunford does a whole streetly

355
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,880
 bank. Is that a good rule of thumb? Alright Alison do you have any penetrating and

356
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,080
 incisive questions? I have a couple of not necessarily penetrating and incisive comments

357
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,800
 the first is I am not a lawyer but my actual day job involves working very closely with

358
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,160
 detail of American trade bar copyright law all of the time they are not the same thing but this

359
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:58,160
 one in this case we're talking about trademarks not copyright but yes I think my understanding is

360
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:05,200
 that you are completely that is a completely correct summation of my understanding of the US

361
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,680
 position as it as it is operated so if you have it seems likely that you have therefore represented

362
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:17,360
 the stream correctly rather than that they said it wrong and then you inadvertently said it right

363
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:23,680
 afterwards you know but my second point is that I just wanted to say when you were talking about

364
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:29,280
 the big back because you know when you go to a harvester you know what you're going to get you're

365
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,480
 never disappointed at a harvester and you're both looking at me completely blankly so I don't

366
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,960
 think I've ever been to a harvester I don't know if Liz has ever been to a harvester no this is a

367
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,800
 joke about Greg Wallace have you heard Greg Wallace has been in the news no it's a popular

368
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,440
 culture reference melod I'm sorry it's also worth noting I don't know if I know it's noted this in

369
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:59,760
 my big old diatribe about trademarks Will Frank who was on the stream was the vice Hugo administrator

370
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,440
 under Dave McCarty as Hugo administrator on a previous Worldcon and he does have some

371
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,320
 choice words to say about Dave so like I don't necessarily want to get into that again but like

372
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,320
 if you if you want to listen to someone saying things about Dave McCarty then you can go and do

373
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,080
 that that is why Kevin was reprimanded the statement from Worldcon intellectual property which we

374
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,360
 linked last episode said in the description why he had been reprimanded because he had

375
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,600
 inaccurately made statements causing people to believe we are not properly servicing our marks

376
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,480
 or something to that effect that's not a direct quote whereas the others were all censured because

377
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,840
 of the cover for we discussed on the last episode there was a great description on file 770 of the

378
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:51,680
 difference between being censured and reprimanded where they kind of had a series of so they had a

379
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,560
 set of rebukes all the way from a slightly strange look to to immediate execution

380
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,200
 we will put the link in the show notes listeners so if you're still watching the hugos after all

381
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,080
 of this and interested in what Dave McCarty's thought processes were while going through all

382
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:17,120
 of this Chris Barkley sat down with him at Capricorn and did an coddling interview about 40 minutes

383
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:24,320
 and has put the entire thing unedited on the internet and it is one of those cases I believe

384
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,760
 where people believe that by giving being given a chance to tell an unvarnished their side of the

385
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,240
 story things will improve for them and I'm not sure this is the case what is your impression

386
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,880
 John and Liz why would you ever do this interview why it does seem very strange it doesn't I've not

387
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,200
 I for this closure I did not listen to it I am I am I'm bad I did not do my homework um but I just

388
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,160
 don't I have not seen anyone say anything about this interview that basically think it was a wise

389
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:59,440
 thing to give this interview and it is it's fanny is fanny's take on it was basically like she always

390
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,320
 thought that Dave had a lot of contempt for fans but a lot of respect for the institutions of fandom

391
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,800
 and it just made her think that actually he has contempt for everything except Dave McCarty

392
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,520
 arrogant, haute and insolent we will put a link in the show notes listeners if you want your blood

393
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,400
 pressure to rise yeah so I just want to put a couple of things which is you know Dave says there

394
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,720
 are two mistakes of substance in the stats that are currently published and it's like why didn't

395
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,440
 you check for this stuff and you know he goes on and talks about how like the SQL queuing from the

396
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,520
 data in the ballot counts has a flaw and it's wrong and there's some bits that are wrong and I'm like

397
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,400
 what did you spend 90 days doing and also I think I mean a lot of his stuff about how he talks about

398
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,480
 how he feels he was delivering what they wanted to have in China is very like sort of paternalistic

399
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,280
 like I felt I was living what they would want in China it doesn't sound like it sounds a bit more

400
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,560
 like kind of Dave saying this is what I my impression of what China would want is and I delivered it

401
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,160
 rather than what the Chinese fans actually wanted yeah but I think that's Dave covering up for his

402
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,720
 Chinese people that he doesn't want to implicate isn't it it's difficult because we don't know

403
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,720
 it could be but there's a lot of very sweeping reactions about how you know their culture is

404
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,600
 different this this is like not what the Chinese spirit is and I mean I know we generalize it

405
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,200
 sometimes but it is kind of a very a lot of generalizations about like what China is and

406
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,000
 and allows from yeah an external perspective it's a bit weird but then we don't have any

407
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,080
 interviews with the other bits of the administration team because all the other bits of the Hugo

408
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,000
 administration and World Concomity are very very quiet so I guess we just have to take what Dave

409
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:39,680
 gives us on the subject of Chinese interference there is a post from Chinese social media which

410
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:48,880
 has been translated which some people are interpreting as a smoking gun for state interference in the

411
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:59,040
 Hugo's we'll put a link in the show notes my view of this is that I can see why people are saying

412
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,600
 this is a smoking gun but it does not contain the word Hugo nor the word award it talks about Cheng

413
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,920
 do in a way that you could read it to mean that there was involvement in the Cheng do program

414
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,320
 or you could read it to mean there was involvement in the Cheng do awards but it doesn't it's not

415
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,560
 specific enough we will put links in the show notes you can form your own opinions listeners

416
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:32,400
 uh Tammy Coxin wrote some thoughts a few weeks ago on Facebook about the Hugo kerfuffle and one

417
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,320
 of the things she said was none of this matters because the World Concom will almost certainly be

418
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,880
 defunct within 10 years there are almost no viable bids for future years and a serious lack of

419
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:48,480
 World Concom running energy I'm going to say two things here which is firstly I am tired of American

420
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,560
 fans saying the World Concom is dying when we have just had a decade with the most international

421
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,040
 World Concomies we've ever had and there seems to be more interest in the thing worldwide than there

422
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,760
 has ever been at any point in its history secondly there is a large amount of the way World

423
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,160
 Concomies are run to do with the worst business meeting at Roberts rules of order and all of that

424
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,680
 that mean people who try to go along and do things with the World Conc end up being severely

425
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,960
 rebutted by people who are very big fans of those structures and that puts people off and if you

426
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,760
 are a part of that structure then you are part of the reason why people do not want to engage with

427
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,040
 the Worldcon and volunteering for it because there are massive fan run conventions all over the world

428
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,240
 so it's not true that they're dying more generally and if there is a specific problem to Worldcon

429
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,920
 we should be thinking about why and we should be addressing that as I just want to it's a very

430
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,320
 quick but I feel very strongly about both of those and I think I want to give a shout out to Glasgow

431
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,880
 they obviously have six months to go six months to go oh my god that's not long but they have six

432
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,960
 months to go but they have a huge team of engaged and enthusiastic volunteers many of whom have never

433
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,880
 worked on a Worldcon before and I'm sure that at least some of those people will still be enthusiastic

434
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,040
 after the convention you know there's no reason why they shouldn't be and and this is the key to

435
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:15,520
 having more enthusiastic Worldcon runners going forward is get people in get them working get them

436
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,720
 engaged and get them happy with what they get to do and also don't mess them around

437
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,720
 another way we could involve more people in the Worldcon and make them feel more involved in it

438
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,840
 is by not doing things like sneakily introducing amendments that prevent online voting

439
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:37,600
 while other people are out of the room Dave oh who did that can you remind me who was the person who

440
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:43,520
 introduced that amendment I do feel a little bit sad that we haven't heard anything from kind of

441
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,320
 Finnish fandom about any repeat Finland bits just because I really liked Finland and would like to

442
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,480
 go back and I do feel maybe we have burnt out all the Finnish fans with one Worldcon which would be

443
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,360
 a shame but you know they don't have to do one every very often maybe in 15 years they'll come back

444
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:03,360
 and do normal I think doing one more than every decade would be foolish and so 2027 would have been

445
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,400
 the earliest I would have expected a resurgent like Finnish bit so we will see it might be that

446
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,080
 there's a 28 or 29 bit but we'll see we've currently got a pattern where the UK is doing one every

447
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,760
 10 years and Ireland is doing one every 10 years and I feel like that's probably the absolute

448
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,400
 tippy top of what those two countries can manage but yes we're going to talk about all of this in

449
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,760
 more detail later but we didn't cover it last episode and I feel strongly that there are issues

450
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,320
 here which are going undiscussed which I think are important

451
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,200
 [Music]

452
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:47,680
 Liz do you pick what pick you I've forgot about picks to be honest um

453
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,400
 you've read three million books so you can definitely pick one of them

454
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,960
 I know but I've got to go remember what I read

455
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,640
 plus some of them were a lot of them were for like Hugo nomination purposes right

456
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,680
 I am going to pick a book which was eligible for Hugo last year and I'm so sorry for the author

457
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:13,920
 that I took too long to read it okay so I am going to pick a pair of books well I'm going to

458
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,520
 pick a book but it has homework which is slightly irritating I'm going to pick How to Find Zodiac

459
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,960
 by Jarek Kobach which is a sequel to his book Motor Spirit the long hunt for the Zodiac

460
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:33,760
 these are books about the Zodiac serial killer who killed at least five people in the 60s and 70s

461
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,040
 in San Francisco and the boy debate area. Motor Spirit basically sums up what we know about the

462
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,400
 Zodiac and does quite a lot of very good work if you've seen David Finch's for excellent film

463
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,520
 Zodiac starring Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr in Amazing Roles Before They Were in Marvel

464
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,440
 which is a great film which I love the book does an awful lot to unpick why the conclusions the

465
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,640
 film draws you to are probably not actually worth the celluloid they're printed on so it's a good

466
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,160
 film that doesn't tell you much about the murders. How to Find Zodiac is a work of fan history about

467
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,960
 a fanzine fan called Paul Duh who lived in Vallejo California at the time of the murders and it is

468
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,880
 absolutely fascinating because the book basically starts with Jarek Kobach Zodiac made a lot of

469
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,520
 very obscure pop culture references to comics and books of the day. Kobach said that he thought

470
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,240
 one of Zodiac's kind of ticks in his letters was probably a pop culture reference that no one had

471
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,040
 been able to find yet and he expressed this suspicion to a friend and the friend said it seems like

472
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,880
 the sort of shit you'd read in fanzines and that sent Kobach down a rabbit hole and there was a

473
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,680
 rabbit at the bottom of its spoiler yes so basically long story short Kobach starts out he finds a

474
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,880
 fanzine fan who lived in Vallejo at the time and he starts trying to exclude that person and

475
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,040
 basically on the basis that he's probably not a zodiac every other suspect is not being zodiac it

476
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,280
 will be possible to exclude this person and the more he finds the more he's like oh no this doesn't

477
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,320
 exclude him and at the end of the the search he's like ah there's nothing that excludes this person

478
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:16,560
 and in fact there's quite a lot that points to him. Now this is a decades old case and like it is

479
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,360
 not necessarily likely that this person is is the zodiac but it's very interesting walk through

480
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:27,600
 fan history and investigative journalism but it also has one key thing which is zodiac left his

481
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,160
 fingerprints at the one of his crime scenes and this person served in the US military and their

482
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,960
 fingerprints are on file so at the point that anyone decides they want to know for sure whether

483
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,520
 this theory is true it will be possible to check because the relevant law enforcement agencies if

484
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,160
 they want to will be able to tell so it is at least a theory that can be firmly true-false which I

485
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,040
 like but it's very interesting even if it's wrong. The detail I most liked and this might be a little

486
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:00,720
 bit of a spoiler for the book is that at some point Kovacs turns up on Dua's x-yves door step

487
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,480
 and says so I've been looking at this thing and she was like oh I've been wondering when do you

488
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,000
 guys turn up. I will say the writing style is idiosyncratic and although I find the content of

489
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,880
 the books very interesting I wish they were differently written is probably the kind of

490
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,440
 just way to say it but it's clear a lot of workers gone into them who wants to pick next.

491
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,400
 After a pick I am going to pick a book which is not really genre it's got some you know tiny

492
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,160
 bits of sort of genre Jason stuff in there but it is mostly a kind of mainstream historical fiction

493
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,480
 it is called Northwoods by Daniel Mason which is basically a story about a house in the woods

494
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,080
 over time and all the people who live in that house in the woods over time or come to find that

495
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:50,080
 house in the woods and each bit is kind of written in a slightly different style about a

496
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:56,320
 slightly different set of people you know some very mundane some very exciting and it's also kind

497
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,680
 of about the nature of that you know it follows the nature as it evolves around the house the trees

498
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,600
 the animals what is there in the woods and how it changes over time and it's just kind of very

499
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:13,040
 engrossing story about it I got nominated for lots of awards and things so yeah that was it

500
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,880
 that's my whole thing the Guardian said it is an epic of American lives yeah he's fair enough

501
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,080
 which travels to the limits of what the novel can do no it doesn't really it's quite good

502
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,920
 it does sound interesting though I mean unless you think it's you know having lots of kind of

503
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,520
 interlinked short stories that form a novel is pushing the boundaries of the novel which I do

504
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,400
 not think is correct but you know not in science fiction well probably fantasy I've read um

505
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,960
 what's name that one book Wirgan Wirgan the alien love war was that it that was a good book

506
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:54,720
 oh Liz that was one of the better clerks that year I thought but yes um interlinked stories is a

507
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:01,280
 very classic form of the genre it's very much a way that novels can be my pick this week is because

508
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,080
 last week I did a print and play game as my pick and it went down really well I decided to do a

509
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:12,320
 different one this week I promise my next three picks will not be print and play games lies I did

510
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,240
 this one I thought well this is a very interesting game and it's also the sort of game that might be

511
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,600
 very interesting to our listenership and here's why this is a game called fantasy map maker that

512
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,800
 was designed by Harry Metcalfe and was an entry in one of the board game geeks contest last year

513
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,000
 it's got a little bit of a build so it uses cards but you can get around the need for cards because

514
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,360
 they're only used to roll quests at the beginning of the game and so you can um you can either roll

515
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:43,440
 them on a chart or you can use pre-printed sheets that have your quest pre-rolled the point about

516
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,720
 it is this is a roll and write game which is a game where you roll dice and then draw things on

517
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,880
 on your or your game sheet but in this case your game sheet is a blank fantasy map and you draw bits

518
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,560
 of your fantasy map onto the game and then you have quests which you get points for fulfilling so

519
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,640
 it's actually got quite a satisfying game in there because you have to score a certain number of

520
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,680
 points to win and this this appeals to my the gamer in me and it also makes you think oh if I put an

521
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,840
 island there I might be able to put a lighthouse on it afterwards for the big points on things like

522
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:20,640
 that and you end up with an actual map that you can frame or paste into your journal or use for

523
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:27,360
 your role-playing game or your or your novel situation and in fact I ended up with two castles

524
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,880
 in a very small space and I was like well why would that be and I created an entire backstory

525
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,840
 about two warring um civilizations who both built castles in the space and I was like oh you could

526
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,240
 you could actually spin an entire novel out of this so it clearly works not what I'm going to

527
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,120
 but I thought it was great and I thought it might be of interest to people in our listeners who do

528
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:50,400
 that's who who do things that require maps it's just a fantasy mapmaker at the moment so I guess

529
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,800
 there's a he could easily expand this to be a science fiction mapmaker or a steampunk mapmaker

530
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,640
 or a horror mapmaker or any sort of mapmaker you might like but it was very good really enjoyed it

531
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,880
 and there will be a link in the show notes and of course it's free because yeah I mean it's free

532
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,200
 until somebody decides that it's worth publishing which I think we probably probably somebody will

533
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,600
 decide this is worth publishing because it's pretty good this is a sort of thing where it might well

534
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:20,960
 be very useful for role playing games I will say like like how easy would it be to do other genres

535
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,560
 in this game um yeah harry says he's about to make an announcement on this game so there's a chance

536
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:32,640
 that that all will become clear but I think he is thinking about expansions but if he decides not

537
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,800
 to think about expansions what the role and writers do or what the printed play gaming fans do is a

538
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,760
 thing called re-themes where they take a game that is good but is not necessarily in the genre

539
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,600
 they like and they remake it in the genre the genre they like that would be pretty simple to do I

540
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:54,160
 think oh and also this this pick is a absolutely transparent excuse for me to stick my art in the

541
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:00,400
 chapter art i.e my finished map from my playthrough of this that would be good okay that was the

542
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:19,360
 octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me is goodbye from me

543
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,920
 i mean obviously the greatest idiocy of it was the um the testament of Jesse Lambie embassy town

544
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,720
 have you guys both read embassy town yes i have not read embassy town and the testament of Jesse

545
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,760
 Lamb i'd have to go back and reread them but i think you're right that like from the vantage

546
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,200
 point of 12 years i've probably picked embassy town over the testament of Jesse Lamb i'm going to

547
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,960
 pick either them over all the other three so oh yeah yeah that's fair i've read hole 0 3 like i would

548
00:51:52,960 --> 00:52:00,000
 describe it as fine i have a bias towards works of science fiction which talk about how alien aliens

549
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,880
 are and how difficult language is and embassy town does boast those and it does it better than

550
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,320
 possibly any other work science fiction except for perhaps a rival and like i can't think of any

551
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,880
 others that do it better so like i adore that book but i am biased the theme music for this
