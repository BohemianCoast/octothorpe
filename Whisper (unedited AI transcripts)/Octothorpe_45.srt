1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
 I should say this is that we've done Oxford Live before, but when we've done Oxford Live

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,880
 before, you've all been on Zoom. How many of you have been to one of our Zoom Oxford

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:18,480
 Live? Cheers, yeah. Cheer if you haven't. But we've not actually... I was under the impression

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,040
 that I was going to have to plug into a soundboard. You were in the backboard. So I brought with

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:38,560
 me a fist full of dongles. And now I have nowhere to plug into anything. Yes. Hello everyone

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:48,320
 and welcome to the very 45th episode of Octa Thor. Yay! I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott.

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,520
 I am definitely not Liz Batty. Who are you? And why are you not Liz Batty? I am a secret

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,680
 intruder who is invited to this podcast because we are here at Novocan and I am Margarit Smith,

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,080
 wearer of many hats and doer of too many things. And we shall be talking about all the podcast.

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,960
 And why is Liz Batty not here? Because she is rubbish. So did you go to Google and do

11
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,480
 the how long does it take to get from Bangkok to Buxton by public transport? The thing is

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,120
 the main problem is the train from Stockport to Buxton. I could get to Stockport with that

13
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,200
 last leg for a while. But no, Liz is indeed not here. Because she is in Bangkok. Because

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,200
 she is in Bangkok. But he is young is here. Yeah, yeah. And there is a Thai restaurant.

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,800
 They don't have teleporters in them. They will look happy to ask. True, I haven't asked.

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:47,160
 The Thai restaurant from Mr Ben. Right. But yes, so we are going to talk about things.

17
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,000
 We are not going to do letters of comment now. But we are going to sit low-eave letters of

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:02,080
 comment at the end when you have all the things to comment on. Such as what was that? You idiots.

19
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:10,560
 So yes, Marguerite, now you are the vice chair of Discon 3 and you are also bidding Dublin

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,840
 and Glasgow. You were talking about Dublin in 2019? 2019. 2019. All of you, all of you.

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,040
 Excellent. So we are going to talk to you about all of that. So we are actually staging

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,840
 an intervention here. I did wonder about that. People, people do stay, friends don't let

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,880
 their friends run World Cons. And I wondered what that said about me. It's a good question.

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,720
 It's a very good question. But first we are going to talk about Novacom. We are talking

25
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,680
 about in-person conventions, they are fun, aren't they? Yes, they are. We are having

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,160
 quite a good time. Is anyone else having a good time? Is it lovely to be out of the

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:58,200
 house? Players just like. Is it nice to be in the bar with actual people doing bar things?

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,840
 Yes. I think three people enjoy that. Everyone else is like, "No, we are here for the programme."

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,480
 I will programme some significantly better in person. I don't know the answer to that.

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,480
 I think some can be. I think a lot will come down to the person themselves. This is my

31
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:25,480
 professional how to consult it. It depends. There are certainly differences. I know some

32
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,080
 people who absolutely adore online programming because it gives them access that they wouldn't

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,560
 otherwise have. That includes not just accessibility items but access to people that they wouldn't

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,600
 otherwise get to hear from or to talk to. That is just inherently more difficult when

35
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,840
 you are in person. But there is something about being in the same space as other people. And

36
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,240
 particularly for this, as a performer, if you like, having the energy flow back from

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,080
 the audience in the room is very different from the online experience, even though they

38
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,880
 both happen. I think there is some of that as well. I mean, I've got two relevant anecdotes

39
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,320
 from this very weekend. Two from this weekend and one from previous weekend. This weekend,

40
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:21,040
 a program I was on yesterday and a spike brought me a pint of porter. That hasn't happened

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,240
 to any of the online conventions I have been to. That has been great. A punctuation we

42
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,760
 did, no, no. I was about to say, Esther brought me several beers of punctuation. That was

43
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,560
 because we put it in the scavenger hunt because we are dicks. When I say we, I mean me.

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,080
 I was a thing in the scavenger hunt of punctuation where we would buy things for the committee.

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,280
 John's idea and I was like, oh no. I can't get very improper and I was like, I have

46
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,600
 cake. I indeed also kept getting cake through the post. I just want to show off hands. How

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,040
 many people in the audience have said publicly that when this is all over, they really like

48
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,480
 to buy me a pint of beer for all the good I have done for family. Right. What if you like

49
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,640
 to go to the bar and get me a pint of porter? Thank you very much.

50
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,840
 I just get my nitty as well. Okay. We've driven with now an audience member down because

51
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,640
 we made to go get them a beer. I don't know whether that is that a good podcasting time

52
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,000
 will tell. I don't really like us. I'm going to get a porter.

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,160
 The other thing is I went to the Christopher Priest panor item and I'm sure it would have

54
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,880
 been very good had I had subtitles and I could hear it. And that was a definite negative

55
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,120
 to not. And I just sat there thinking one of you say something. One of my online regular

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,200
 acquaintances very much prefers online program because as he says, you can start it halfway

57
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:53,120
 through and then speed up through the boring. And the other thing you can do at an online

58
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,880
 program is leave in a way that turns out to be really embarrassing for anyone who is wondering

59
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,920
 how to skip through the boring bits of this episode of Octa Torp. If you skip to about

60
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,160
 the 40 or 45 minute mark, that's when people from the audience will start shouting at us.

61
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,760
 Yeah. No. Have you seen the fine apparel that Ang is wearing today? Oh, yes. Ang is going

62
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,360
 to model that. We might need to use this chapter art darling. Yes. All right. Ang,

63
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:33,840
 I'm also wearing apparel by hiding it beneath the jumper. But I am cosplaying my podcast

64
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:46,720
 with my purple jeans and purple t-shirt. Ang is modeling our fetching Jesus t-shirt. Yes.

65
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,680
 We were an original swear by Liz Batty. Yes. But we, so when we were talking about spot

66
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,360
 discount at one point, it was pointed out on the podcast that the blah, blah, blah,

67
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,440
 sounded a bit like a sad talk about. And so I commissioned a piece of art from Alison,

68
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,880
 which is a kind of like marching band logo or like patch. It's a patch. It's like a

69
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,960
 fire. No. Oh, no, it's the word confine. Yes. The word confine. Yes. The patch. We did.

70
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,440
 Yeah. The satro burn. I've done a lot of art for you. So we have some worlds also. So

71
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,000
 considering, yes, considering that this podcast is entirely audio, I seem to have made an

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,280
 awful lot of art for it. That's my fault. And I don't apologize. Yeah. That's the story

73
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,840
 of my life. But yes, no, and also there are people here who do not usually come to the

74
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,480
 Novocomp. There are a lot. There are quite a lot of people at this convention who, because

75
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,080
 when they said last night, who was here at the first Novocomp? There were a lot. Is that

76
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,920
 one in the audience that they first never come? No. No. No. Okay. I guess. Spite. Yeah.

77
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:05,160
 I thought spite was. But this is Bill Burns's first. First Novocomp, for instance. What

78
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:12,240
 have you enjoyed most about Novocomp? I think that, to be honest, one of the things that

79
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,680
 I have enjoyed is simply walking around and seeing everybody talking to each other. Because

80
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,480
 that is something that is very difficult to do with the technology that we currently have.

81
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,040
 I am still extremely socially awkward. I won't necessarily go up and join in. But, you know,

82
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,560
 knowing that people are having a good time is part of why I do pop-allowing. So it's a

83
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,760
 good thing to see even when I'm not running this one. I've run into people in hallways.

84
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,640
 I like running into people in hallways. I haven't done that for a while. Because I

85
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,160
 have seen people. But I don't, it's always been people that have made a particular appointment

86
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,320
 to go and see. I think that habit of just going somewhere and running into a load of

87
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,840
 people you know, but you wouldn't necessarily have the not appointment people. I will say,

88
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,800
 you know, one of the things that I've noticed here in particular is an increase in the number

89
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,080
 of people who see my name. And finally, I can tell, associate the name with the face.

90
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,640
 They're like, "Oh, I've seen you around. I know." I have an anecdote from this convention.

91
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,640
 I have an anecdote from this convention. I've heard that you've just felt this anecdote,

92
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,840
 which is a Friday night. You've heard the anecdote, I've always given you. I like that

93
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,480
 you've had in your face already, even though this is on you. On Friday night, I was in a

94
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,920
 restaurant and I saw a number of people eating dinner together. And I went up to one of them

95
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,240
 and said, "Because I knew that she was being asked up, there's hello, Marguerite." At which

96
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,080
 point everyone fell over because it was in fact Meg, Meg and Darnell. And then they explained to

97
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,400
 me that Meg and Marguerite, neither of whom I knew at all well before the pandemic to be

98
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,520
 fair, I mean, I had met them both, but not in a kind of, you know, they were both baric maitresses.

99
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,680
 And I had met them both, but I had not met them in a way that associated their kind of three

100
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:12,160
 dimensional actual human beings. I kind of had a notion of these are nice women with long hair who

101
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,840
 are doing stuff on the Worldcon and are a bit baby Celtic.

102
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:27,280
 Just in case any of you have not met Meg, she is tall and thin and very graceful and I have

103
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:34,000
 none of those things. So when Alison told me this, I also felt about the place that I had because

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,440
 it's like, "Oh yes, please keep confusing me." Yeah, what you need to do is get Sue Mason to draw you.

105
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,840
 Anyway, I finished the end of that because at the following day, I was happened to be by the

106
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,320
 Glasgow table as Meg and Marguerite were both there. So they did a kind of comparative thing.

107
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:00,400
 This is Meg. This is Marguerite. I mean, that's also the horrible way, but you know, you're different

108
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:08,560
 shape people. Those are appropriate gestures. Yeah, sorry, this is Meg. This is Marguerite.

109
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,080
 This is one of those things that will not translate to radio, but yes.

110
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,240
 That would be actually not chapter art, but you'll find a gift.

111
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:24,880
 So Meg is very tall and shapely. Marguerite is very shapely.

112
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,480
 I've also got a beer list.

113
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:39,760
 Esther is, well, this is very good. Alison now has three different ingredients in front of her.

114
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:50,320
 I've only two hands. Oh, balanced diet. So moving, I was going to say swiftly on, but moving slowly

115
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,880
 on with the digression into a punchline. Is this your first mobile corner? How many

116
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,280
 of you know the ones you've been to before? It is actually not my first mobile corner,

117
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:06,000
 but I have not been to many. I think I've only been to one other. It would have been 2018, I think.

118
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:16,080
 I've been nodding. I was there representing Donald Clinton as it was, and did not then make it in

119
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,560
 2019 before the world changed. So how many people, when they asked how many Nova Cons you'd been to

120
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,800
 yesterday, could not in fact remember? There's more than half the room.

121
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,280
 Because very fortunately, they kind of went to more than 10, and then they went to 50, and that made

122
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,320
 it quite good. That's how you do good stats. It will be incidences.

123
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:48,880
 Isn't that accounting system one, two, many lots? I have definitely been to lots of Nova Cons.

124
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,440
 Have you been to one, two, few, many or lots of Nova Cons? I think I've been to four, then it's my

125
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,240
 fourth. I don't make anywhere near as often as I make it to EastCon, but yeah, I wanted to make it.

126
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,640
 I had another anecdote about program at conventions, which was that when

127
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,640
 Alison and Spike and Tom and everyone else nods off in program, you can take selfies of yourself

128
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,160
 with them, and it's very funny. You can't really do that on Zoom, and it's a shame.

129
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:25,840
 So should we talk about World Cons? Oh yeah, no, because we have... I see those eyes on me already.

130
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,160
 Well, Margry was working for Nicholas White on the Hugo team at... You would like

131
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,640
 Deputy Division Head for... Correct.

132
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,800
 ...Gusvus for just gone, and then you resigned from that role, and then just recently, like,

133
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,560
 a couple of months ago, so start of September. Yeah, you became one of the vice chairs.

134
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,640
 You're the first ever Irish vice chair of the Baltimore World Cons. I think that's a

135
00:13:52,640 --> 00:14:01,280
 same assumption. So that was for people who didn't know the disc on, which has... I don't mean to diss you,

136
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:10,640
 Com. That was too well planned. Yes, you should have told me what for doing puns, but that one was...

137
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:17,680
 That was bad. It was there. I don't want to diss your Com, but it has had a bit of an ability to

138
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:26,240
 not always say the perfectly right thing. Correct. So what convinced you to take on this? Because

139
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
 it's very reasonable. When you said... When you said...

140
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,000
 ...you might let friends run a Com with, say, Esther or Nicholas, but friends really should have

141
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,080
 stopped you from going, "Yeah, I'm going to step up and do the disc on things." So what made the

142
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,840
 difference? For me, a lot of the difference, and since Nicholas is here, he can verify some of this,

143
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,360
 part of why the entire WIS15 resigned. It was not just refusing to work for Nicholas anymore.

144
00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:00,240
 The personal decisions was a point of principle, and we thought it was very important to say we were

145
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,720
 not willing to build that particular world clock. Well, there were other changes that happened after

146
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,680
 that, including a new chair, and from what I saw, that was much more the World Cons that I thought

147
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,640
 I was going to. I am seeing internal correspondence from the new chair. It's really very encouraging.

148
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,560
 And it has been... I think Mary Robinette seems to be doing a really fine job, and so you thought,

149
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,160
 "Well, I've got that one." I did. I did. I thought, "Here is my chance to make some of those changes

150
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,560
 that I want to try to bring in." I mean, it is... It's not even turning one of the giant ships.

151
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,080
 It's more like trying to turn the iceberg itself. It just takes so much effort, and sometimes

152
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,280
 still doesn't work, but this was a good chance to continue trying. And the more that we can all

153
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,280
 continue trying, the more likely it is to actually actually happen. Thanks, Barida. We're very much

154
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,040
 taking the option of not trying and just complaining about it on the radio instead, which... What

155
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,760
 you have is the difference, because usually it's social media. Well, I think we usually, you know,

156
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,080
 we usually make sure we argue. Like, we don't... We present both sides. We also present both sides.

157
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,400
 I mean, I think... Usually because two of us disagree and we have two. I think just gone to be quite a

158
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,720
 troubled Worldcon, even by the standpoint. I mean, obviously all Worldcons have a load of

159
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,520
 crap going on behind the scenes. It doesn't necessarily... It kind of... There's always a load of things,

160
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,240
 and then every sort of something bubbles up and there's a little flurry, and then it goes away.

161
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,600
 But just gone and seems to have had a very continuous thing of it, and it's kind of coming together.

162
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,440
 Now you've got how many weeks to go? We have... I'm sorry, I should... I...

163
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:49,680
 That was... For the listeners, that was four and a half. I do actually have a pile of sticky notes

164
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,280
 at home, and the only thing it is is a countdown of how many days I pull one off every day.

165
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,960
 Should you be like rocking Xs on a calendar?

166
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,480
 Want to see Promise? Yeah. Or maybe a gold star for every day, we make it through...

167
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,320
 Yes. That's a great idea. So you said like you kind of decided to go on board the

168
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,040
 Disgrom ship, because there were things that you thought you could achieve. So what was the kind of...

169
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,280
 What was the kind of thing you were like hoping to do? So some of the things that I was hoping to do

170
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,920
 were coming out of previous Worldcons, which in hands up I have worked on those as well. It's not

171
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:34,240
 somebody else's problem, but I know there was quite a strong reaction to, for example, the

172
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,280
 hero ceremony last year. And people felt that the finalists were not getting the recognition they

173
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,880
 deserved, in part because traditions have changed. You know, I know that George RR Martin, who was the

174
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,000
 Toastmaster last year, and who designed that ceremony, those were the things that he enjoyed

175
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,440
 as a young writer. He liked the anticipation. He liked that, you know, sense of not knowing and

176
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,160
 drawing it out. And boy, it was cruel, but then wasn't it fantastic when he found out. And that's

177
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,920
 just not really how it works anymore. You know, things have changed and that wasn't recognized.

178
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:20,560
 So by being able to come back and say, these finalists are our sort of celebrities in a way,

179
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,280
 you know, everyone who is there is their unequal footing. But we as a body have decided to

180
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:34,080
 honor these people. We should honor these people being able to come back in and say, yes, there will

181
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,280
 be, you know, a party, there will be pictures, there will be space for everyone to bring a plus

182
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,720
 one. We will just make sure that this kind of stuff happens was important. Some of the other

183
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,800
 aspects that I was hoping then to change, or at least to be involved in along the way were

184
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:57,520
 things like making sure that it's a DC worldcon. I won't say that any old asshole can run a

185
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,080
 worldcon because that's not entirely true. It takes a very particular type. There is a difference

186
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,680
 as an attendee and as somebody who's worked on them between this was a fun worldcon and

187
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,960
 holy shit, that was, you know, this locations, worldcon. You know, I know it was one of

188
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,720
 the things that I was hoping to do. Do you have any connection with DC? No, no. So what have you

189
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,840
 done to immerse yourself in kind of DC culture to try and get that sense of the local, I can do

190
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,920
 an anecdote which is that we did the news letter for Dublin and none of us are Irish. What?

191
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:45,120
 It's Irish. Not Irish. Not quite Scottish. I'm vaguely Celtic. There it is. But we did, so we did quite a

192
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,240
 lot of things that we thought as English people would make it more Irish, bearing in mind James's

193
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,560
 injunction that we would not put any leprechauns in it. We did put a leprechaun in the spoof, but

194
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:06,240
 you had that. But we also had an Irish sensitivity reader who was, he was lovely. But, you know, so we

195
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,560
 did kind of our assistive to just, but we also thought, what do we like about Irish culture as

196
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,880
 the Irish represented? So we had a lot of folklore and we had the drop capitals and things like that.

197
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,640
 We did quite a lot of stuff that was designed to make the news letter super Irish, just by the

198
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,800
 fact that we are super not Irish. And I think it was fine. I think. Yeah, definitely. And so we're

199
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,040
 doing, we are doing similar things, but the biggest thing that we're doing is bringing people from

200
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,680
 DC in to tell those stories. Yeah. We've made sure to have DC-based writers, you know, write the

201
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,200
 script for our Hugo ceremony. And actually, we've done a slightly different thing in that we have,

202
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:48,560
 for lack of a better term, a writer's room, you know, has actually been announced. And we're having

203
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,040
 them write all of our majors ceremony so that we can get some of those references throughout the

204
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,560
 weekend repeated. You know, it's not just, here's the opening ceremony. And here's the Hugo ceremony,

205
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,240
 and here's the closing ceremony, and here's the masquerade. Here's this, that, and the other.

206
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,680
 So where we can, we're trying to bring that only one piece, but it's also, and Mary Robinette said,

207
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,320
 this very flatterably when she was, was asking me to join was her job as chair is to find the

208
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,680
 smarter people and let them go do their thing. And I think that's very much true of how do you

209
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:29,760
 bring that location sense as well? You find the people whose location it is, and let them go.

210
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,480
 You build the stage for them to do their thing. Yeah. Yeah. I think that makes a lot.

211
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,640
 So do you think that part you get involved, there was a strong sense of DC place in

212
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:48,000
 this culturally? I did not get that from the original workings that I had. There were certainly

213
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,720
 DC aspects to it, and some of those will become more obvious as things are announced, but there

214
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,920
 wasn't that real sense of this could only happen in DC, where I think some of this stuff we're

215
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,480
 doing now could only happen in DC. And I think that's, that's the difference.

216
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,200
 So, and I think one of the things I've liked about the World Curves, the World Curves are

217
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,720
 particularly stick in my mind. I've been to 10 World Curves, and the best of them have really

218
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,880
 had that sense of place that could not have been anywhere else. Yeah. For example, Reno,

219
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,840
 when I left the kind of mountain doing, Chris Garcia's car, and when I got back it was too hot to touch,

220
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,160
 that was a very, you know, experience. I remember that. And there was also like program, I think.

221
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,680
 I've, I've friends don't let their friends drink a American mountain,

222
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,520
 because look at them honestly. So you're also involved in Glasgow.

223
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:45,520
 So can I just check, are you doing any World Cons between this gun and Glasgow?

224
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,360
 Technically no.

225
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,560
 So I was part of the executive team for Chai-Kong 8, which is coming up next year.

226
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:03,760
 But Helen Montgomery and I, who she is the chair, she and I had agreed ahead of time that

227
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,960
 coming into 2022, because that is the year of the vote for Glasgow, I would be withdrawing from

228
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,760
 Chai-Kong. I don't think anybody's a song. So, so yes, I, and again, I don't think anybody would

229
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,800
 have raised any objections, but I just wanted to remove any possibility of that. So I sped that

230
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,120
 up a bit when I took on the DC. Yeah, kind of went. I kind of went. Hello, hello, hello,

231
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,160
 yeah. Hello, hello, yeah, hello, yeah. I think it's reasonable. So what is it you're doing from

232
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,480
 Glasgow? I was, I was wondering, I was wondering what it is. Sorry, can I just check something?

233
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,800
 It's Friday, it's five o'clock. It's...

234
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,920
 So what, what is it you're doing for Glasgow? I am the chair of vice for Glasgow.

235
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,400
 Or the vice chair? Excellent. Do you just have one? Do you have like a Latinx

236
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 Covice chair? Not for Glasgow. Not for Glasgow. Do you have like a Scotts Gaelic

237
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
 Covice chair? No, or not yet. I thought you meant it. Certainly.

238
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,680
 Looking at each other. Well, then they're going, oh, yeah. I was like, oh, hey, there's an idea.

239
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:22,000
 I think you should get Helena on the side, because she's like, she could bring in the Glasgow

240
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,680
 element. You know, when we're talking about getting the authentic Glasgow voice, because we

241
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:32,240
 were saying in the bar last night about what the authentic Glasgow voice is like. See you, Jimmy.

242
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,840
 No, you, me, man. Stop that.

243
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,760
 She's not the asker. She sees four broadies.

244
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:52,000
 I think you can accept this as prime content. Yeah, yeah. So which, which voices are you the chair of?

245
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,520
 Everything that Esther does not wish to handle. Actually, indeed, indeed. Actually, I was

246
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,920
 some white who seemed to do this at Peoplepong in 2020. Just before everything broke down.

247
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,400
 My job is actually to protect the chair.

248
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,480
 Like this. Excellent.

249
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,160
 We're taking our bullets. We'll talk some 2020 at Peoplepong.

250
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,200
 Oh, there was a quincy.

251
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,800
 We're just being a botches. Oh.

252
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,240
 Because what I do, I haven't added it about Peoplepong.

253
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,400
 Yes, but we've told it on the podcast before.

254
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,920
 Perhaps you can't hold it to. Yeah.

255
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,760
 You have shit. Okay. Sorry.

256
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,960
 Oh, there's a limit.

257
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,160
 Well, Alison workshops her jokes.

258
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,160
 So friends don't let their friends workshop their jokes before.

259
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,960
 Yeah.

260
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,160
 Hey, this never happened.

261
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,800
 Hashtag a week.

262
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,920
 Oh, yeah.

263
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,560
 We can have the question for now.

264
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,720
 So, the name Christina like.

265
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,560
 Yes, very nice.

266
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:52,960
 She's late.

267
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,920
 She's late.

268
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
 So how long have you been involved with Glasgow?

269
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,640
 Oh goodness.

270
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,800
 But yeah, just about five years.

271
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,120
 Oh, thanks.

272
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,680
 Oh, thanks.

273
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,000
 Sorry.

274
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,560
 This is a very recent acquisition of mine at this time.

275
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,720
 Goodness.

276
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,520
 I suppose you and I spoke about this particular position 2019.

277
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,200
 So two years of this.

278
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,840
 And has it been filled so far?

279
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,400
 Yeah.

280
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,040
 Pretty much.

281
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,440
 It is.

282
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,920
 It is.

283
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,000
 And I say this with all love to my Irish con running compatriots.

284
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,040
 The certainly the most frighteningly competent it's been.

285
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,560
 OK, so what I see because I have a very, very tiny role in Glasgow,

286
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,160
 which I do mention occasionally on the podcast.

287
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,520
 I have an interest in my role in Glasgow is to get all the old thoughts come along.

288
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,960
 And that seems to be going pretty well.

289
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,360
 Yeah.

290
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,800
 People are pretty positive.

291
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,720
 It's going to be fantastic convention.

292
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,360
 Very purple.

293
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,880
 Yes, but it's a slightly different shade to all to talk about.

294
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,120
 Yeah.

295
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,760
 If I do use some print on demand t-shirts while you're in a dry spell,

296
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,800
 then they're going to be that car.

297
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,400
 So, you know, that's how it works.

298
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,040
 You're OK.

299
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,760
 How did you know?

300
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,240
 I was not right.

301
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,200
 I think that's a good question.

302
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
 I think that's a good question.

303
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
 I was drinking with your wife.

304
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,360
 I'm not used to it.

305
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,320
 So, yes.

306
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,840
 So what is kind of, so you have a year now until the vote, a try con.

307
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,040
 Are you confident you're going to win?

308
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,360
 What do you think there's going to be a Royal Inn?

309
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,240
 And they're just going to...

310
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,960
 Yeah, when is it?

311
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
 Everybody's looking at Esther now.

312
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,160
 As representative, I'm protecting my chair.

313
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:33,040
 Listeners, audio description at this point,

314
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,840
 Mulgory Tcontorted herself in interesting ways.

315
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,440
 That is probably the benest I've been all weekend.

316
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,880
 Like a wicky face.

317
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:51,840
 I will never say 100% confidence until the vote is complete,

318
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,160
 just because so many things can happen.

319
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,920
 However, no, I don't expect a writing vote at this stage.

320
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,320
 I believe that for the most part, writing votes

321
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,040
 they're like sharks, they sense, weakness.

322
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,920
 And we haven't shown any or maybe just real...

323
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,040
 So we could maybe find the weak spot or we could be noisy.

324
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,840
 Yay!

325
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,680
 We, um, you haven't shown any weakness.

326
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,400
 So what's happened with this year's writing vote was clearly

327
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,120
 that there was a sense of people not wanting to go to Chengdu

328
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,960
 and thinking wholly accurately that Memphis might not quite have got its sugar together.

329
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,320
 We are a family-friendly podcast.

330
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,880
 Yeah, I probably should have checked that before swearing all through it.

331
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,440
 No, no.

332
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,240
 No, I mean...

333
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,480
 We may be stopping B because John can't be asked.

334
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,120
 Yes.

335
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,000
 We're mostly family-friendly as long as you don't mind the word fuck.

336
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
 As long as your children swear, that's yours.

337
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,920
 Yes.

338
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,840
 And so you're also involved with Dublin in 2029.

339
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,960
 I am.

340
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,360
 Now, I have two questions and there is a few...

341
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,320
 I don't know, I'm going to lead into that.

342
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,280
 I actually had a segue.

343
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,320
 Oh, you have a segue.

344
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,560
 So speaking of world compits that are 100% not going to lose,

345
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,680
 I understand you've launched a bid for Dublin in 2029.

346
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,240
 That's excellent.

347
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,720
 I like that.

348
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,400
 Although I worry that you've jinxed us.

349
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:10,880
 No.

350
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,280
 So how it works right is that...

351
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,040
 Is this Allison's predictor?

352
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,000
 This is my predictor.

353
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,760
 I don't think...

354
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,480
 Because the smoths like to think they organise the vote.

355
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,120
 But actually, there's a lot of ordinary American fans who vote.

356
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,360
 And my belief is that America...

357
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,120
 They're kind of potty for the Irish.

358
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,480
 And fundamentally, you could be like,

359
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,840
 "We're going to hold it in a bog in a...

360
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
 In a tree."

361
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,400
 I'll be able to ask.

362
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
 As someone from Cambridge,

363
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,920
 if you hold it in a bog, I will be there.

364
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,960
 There has not been enough bog-based world comps.

365
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,240
 It's a terrible shame.

366
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,120
 There are actually bog diving competitions.

367
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,640
 We could bring some of that in.

368
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,800
 But they were circles and we could just...

369
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,720
 Yeah, I can bet you could get people to do that.

370
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,200
 I was going to ask two serious questions.

371
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,760
 First question.

372
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,560
 One of the strategies that has been employed by British and Irish bits

373
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,680
 over the last few years is announcing far enough in advance

374
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,480
 that it is unlikely that other bids will contest.

375
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,760
 Is that something you are hoping will happen again in 2029?

376
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,480
 That is part of why we weren't announcing early.

377
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,040
 Yes, we want to make it clear that we are intending to run for 2029

378
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,320
 being a nice crossroads year since that's sort of how I'm thinking about it.

379
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,120
 And that Brian Nisbitt and I bid for 2029 as the anniversary of 2019.

380
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,840
 But it's also the 10 years until the 100th anniversary of the first world comp.

381
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
 Okay, so that was 1939.

382
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,960
 So 2039 will be 100 years on.

383
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,080
 That's a perfect spot for lots of activity.

384
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,840
 So you are in 2029?

385
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,960
 So we're going for 2029.

386
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,440
 Right.

387
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,840
 My serious question is, so if there were one complaint that anyone must make

388
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,280
 about the excellent previous Irish World comp,

389
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,080
 2019, which I have told everyone I loved,

390
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,760
 I'd be to 10 World comps of that push.

391
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,680
 That was my favourite by Niles.

392
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,640
 For reasons that maybe it had more to do with me personally than...

393
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,320
 I mean, it was a lovely, lovely con.

394
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,440
 But it was the first convention when none of my children were under 18.

395
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,160
 So my question was, if people had one complaint about the W World comp,

396
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,080
 it would be that the CCD was absolutely stuffed full to the gun.

397
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,640
 So what are you going to do to get some more comfort space?

398
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,800
 So one of the things that we are already working on is planning to work with the NCI,

399
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,960
 which is the college that is in the building's next door to the CCD.

400
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,000
 Because they do have quite a lot of suitable programme space,

401
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 lecture halls, amphitheater style seating.

402
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,200
 They also have a relatively large atrium that we can use for exhibits or displays or other activities.

403
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,360
 And the biggest thing that we're doing is planning that in from the start.

404
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,160
 I mean, when 2019 started,

405
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,520
 nobody ever expected that it was going to be as big as it was.

406
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,720
 And the CCD holds, notionally, 5,500 people.

407
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,360
 Turns out that might not quite be true in the way that a World comp distributes people through the

408
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,880
 building. But I know from seeing past emails, from seeing past projections,

409
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,720
 people were saying, "We'd be lucky if we got 3,500, 4,000 people."

410
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,000
 They fit fine in the CCD. So one of the things that we're doing now is obviously,

411
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,560
 as World comps as a whole, get bigger, as we now have this experience of a convention within the CCD,

412
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:36,480
 to say, "Okay, this is what worked. This is what didn't. How do we start trying to solve some of

413
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,520
 these problems? Do we start getting NCI space? Do we find other additional space nearby?"

414
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,360
 Ireland and the UK in general do not have the US model of a giant convention center

415
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,400
 immediately attached to a hotel. You know, Glasgow is very lucky that we do have that.

416
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,160
 But it means that our World plans have to look slightly different.

417
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,840
 Most of the time, we will not be lucky enough to have everything within one contained building.

418
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,640
 But that means that we have to plan for what that means in terms of accessibility and

419
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,360
 size. You know, I saw a comment shortly after Brian and I announced that was, effectively,

420
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,080
 that this person would not attend any Dublin convention unless we promised that we would

421
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,680
 cap membership in order to keep numbers down. And it's not something I heard.

422
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,320
 We won't miss them. But exactly.

423
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,560
 You said about 3, 2, 3, 9 being a crossroads.

424
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,400
 And I always sort of assumed that at some point someone would try and work out how to hold the

425
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,160
 bolt con in New York again so that it could be in New York in 2039. Are you expecting that to happen?

426
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,120
 Are you expecting to bid Dublin for 2039?

427
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,840
 Well, I would never say never. Very unlikely.

428
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,040
 It's not, no. It's not, no.

429
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,280
 2039. Because I will be another 10 years older at that stage.

430
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:00,720
 I wanted to make sure that the possibility is open. I would love to see a New York anniversary of

431
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,000
 the World Con, but there's always that debate about which was the actual first.

432
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Where was the first science fiction convention?

433
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,040
 Everyone, please.

434
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:14,400
 Yes. But even within the US, even within the US, there's debate about was it New York,

435
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,040
 was it Philadelphia, was it? But the first official World Con was part of the World

436
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,000
 World Con, the first World Con was definitely.

437
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
 Which is why it's a big world.

438
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,240
 You know, so I think it might be a bit difficult to take a batch of New York.

439
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,440
 I'm sure people would love to.

440
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:25,920
 Yes.

441
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,120
 It's not impossible. I think it would take an awful lot of work from people who are

442
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,840
 extremely busy at the moment, or an influx of new people and a huge reduction in prices.

443
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,560
 Unfortunately.

444
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,360
 That's very fair. That was my other question.

445
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,840
 Excellent.

446
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:49,600
 We're now going to open for letters of comment.

447
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,720
 Please submit your letters of comment through the medium of yelling from the audience.

448
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,040
 No, please raise your hand.

449
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,440
 Oh, right.

450
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:57,920
 Yes.

451
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,280
 Are they allowed to make a letter of comment?

452
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,480
 The letter of comment is not finished with a question.

453
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,360
 No, no, no.

454
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,320
 Letter of question.

455
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,200
 How do you want to?

456
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,760
 Do we have any letters of comment?

457
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,880
 Sit your hands up if you do.

458
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,080
 If not, we'll do picks.

459
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,880
 Do you have asked, ask, or thought questions?

460
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,920
 Don't all shout out once.

461
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,400
 I don't know.

462
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,320
 I should warn you that if you say anything, it might be recorded and used in the podcast.

463
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,800
 Against?

464
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,680
 Oh, yeah.

465
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,400
 No, it's the podcast.

466
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,720
 We can do picks for people who are ruining.

467
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,520
 No, we can do our picks.

468
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,720
 Oh, but we have a question.

469
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,600
 Nicholas White.

470
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,320
 It is I.

471
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
 Oh, we have to leave.

472
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,480
 I'm going to have to be bad.

473
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,520
 You're going to have to leave.

474
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,480
 Will you blue-tash?

475
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,040
 You promise.

476
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,760
 What have you voted for in this year's Hugo Awards?

477
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,160
 Ha ha!

478
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,520
 That was going to be my pick.

479
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,000
 My pick was going to be, and I've written in show notes,

480
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,320
 I was going to pick voting in the Hugo Awards because I'm insufferably smug

481
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,000
 about having done all the reading.

482
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,160
 How many of the reading have you done, Harrison?

483
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,640
 I read helicopter stories.

484
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,760
 Right, and who?

485
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,560
 And the years?

486
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,720
 Some Hugo voter packet, Alison.

487
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,200
 Caroline.

488
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,040
 And so Caroline and I submitted.

489
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:12,400
 I, my primary Hugo reading is that I have put, I put 300 hours into Hugo reading

490
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,560
 for this year's Hugo Awards and it was all Hades.

491
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:16,880
 Yes.

492
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,680
 Have you, have you enjoyed the Hugo roster this year?

493
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,240
 Have you?

494
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,480
 She's my chair of the book.

495
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,080
 She hasn't read a book since late September.

496
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,400
 For the listeners, Marguerite is making a face.

497
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
 I will let you imagine the face.

498
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,160
 I have enjoyed what I have partaken on,

499
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,400
 but I am, you know, working on the World Council.

500
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,120
 There are two things there.

501
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,720
 One, I am actually busy.

502
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,360
 Two, I am, well, can I say two things?

503
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,400
 There are several things.

504
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,680
 One, too many, whatever.

505
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,800
 So she's not going to actually say what the quick picture he goes on?

506
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,600
 Probably not other than, of course, I will vote for all of my friends

507
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
 because everybody knows that the he was a root.

508
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,000
 Please don't take that out of context.

509
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,680
 But I am not part of the Hugo's up.

510
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,720
 So could you say that again so that you won't get tung-looted by the future?

511
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,880
 Yes, it might be quite useful.

512
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,840
 Thank you very much.

513
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,480
 Yes, I am putting spirit fair above Hades, I'm sorry.

514
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,600
 Yeah, I understand that.

515
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,160
 That's the likes of a fair fair also.

516
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,600
 I very like that.

517
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,160
 Yeah, we'll probably have to have what we need to do is have a kind of post-13

518
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
 wash-up thing where we talk about all the stuff.

519
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,360
 That's the next episode.

520
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,640
 My pick for this week is the fanthology from Corfu.

521
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,720
 And normally when you say fanthology, it just has a single A,

522
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,400
 but in this case it is a fanthology,

523
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
 which is pronounced exactly the same way, which has two A's,

524
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,760
 which is one of these things that's really difficult on a podcast.

525
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,400
 And that's because it's not a fanthology of general fan writing,

526
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
 it's a fanthology of fanfiction,

527
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,120
 but it's not fanfiction in the sense of stories such in universes that are written by fans.

528
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:08,640
 It's fanfiction in the sense of fan writing with the fans as fictional characters.

529
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,600
 And it turned out, because I didn't think I'd have done any of this,

530
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,040
 but I started reading the excellent fanthology

531
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,920
 that Sandra Bond has put together for Corfu.

532
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,680
 "Guests of Honor" and previous president knows.

533
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,960
 "Guests of Honor" knew...

534
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,600
 "You took the bond."

535
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,280
 Oh, so for people who don't know,

536
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,000
 Corfu has the best award.

537
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 There's been a lot of talk about honors recently,

538
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,560
 but the best honor in fandom without a single doubt

539
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,760
 is the past president of the fan writers of America.

540
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,240
 Okay, and the great thing about the past president of the Fabrics of America

541
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,360
 is that it's never a president.

542
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,840
 They just elect every year,

543
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,680
 we elect a new past president,

544
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,320
 so they don't have any duties whatsoever.

545
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,960
 And the newest past president of what is Sandra Bond,

546
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,240
 who is in the audience tonight,

547
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,120
 she was also guest of honor at Corfu last week.

548
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,160
 The fanthology is called "Dangerous Visions."

549
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,600
 That's from the extra A in it.

550
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,480
 And the great thing about this is it turns out,

551
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,840
 when I started reading it,

552
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,160
 that it turns out that all the fan writing I've ever done

553
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,800
 is in fact fan fiction with an extra A in it,

554
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,280
 and I'm not realised because I don't lie.

555
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,880
 I just polished my jokes and made me vomit in the vlog.

556
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,080
 So, so, so as a newbie to the fanthology,

557
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,520
 where could I get my hands on one?

558
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

559
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,080
 The spikes holding them up.

560
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:36,000
 You could go onto Amazon.co.uk and buy it there.

561
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,320
 I don't know if you say how much does it want Amazon?

562
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,840
 It's probably also a past.

563
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,880
 Some money.

564
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,920
 Some money.

565
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,320
 But remember, when you're searching on dangerous visions,

566
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,080
 put in an extra A and put in edited by Sandra Bond.

567
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,280
 It is great. Fantastic.

568
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,640
 There would also be a link in the service.

569
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,040
 And there would be a link across the link in the service.

570
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,560
 Did you have a pick, Malcolm?

571
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,520
 I think my pick at the moment,

572
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,320
 I have two.

573
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,080
 One is a new novel that somebody has let me pre-read,

574
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,680
 Joseph Elliott Campbell.

575
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,640
 And I'm enjoying it very much so far,

576
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,240
 but the other is the anthology that's available here at Nelbokan.

577
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,960
 Because it is also absolutely fantastic.

578
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,200
 I haven't really been able to dig into it.

579
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,160
 I might have missed my flight on Friday and come in late.

580
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,240
 So, I came in yesterday morning.

581
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,480
 But I've had a brief look and it looks amazing.

582
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,280
 It's gone.

583
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,000
 Some of the stories that were in chat books

584
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 from the other 49 never comes.

585
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,360
 There's also new stories.

586
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,120
 New stories from authors.

587
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,000
 So, there's very exciting authors in the anthology.

588
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,320
 And I have no idea who I live and I am out of it.

589
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,200
 You know Carrie.

590
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,720
 Carrie, Carrie, Carrie, Carrie.

591
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,960
 Adrian Shikovsky's starting to feel like this.

592
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,920
 What?

593
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,400
 I think he embags that one of the stories.

594
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,320
 Because the embags to chat books were some money

595
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,520
 as I found to my benefit on eBay some years ago.

596
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,040
 I have a lot of news, but I'm not selling it.

597
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,080
 I used to have four of them.

598
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,880
 Sick out.

599
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,440
 Yeah.

600
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
 Because it used to be that you couldn't, if you could.

601
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,800
 No, it still is.

602
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,400
 So, me and his back, you got one of each.

603
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,280
 We were not asked.

604
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,720
 But, you know, it's fine.

605
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,680
 Two things.

606
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,480
 So, that's great.

607
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,280
 Pics.

608
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,160
 Any other questions?

609
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,200
 Esther.

610
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,200
 Fan favorite Badger the Cat.

611
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,080
 Yes or no?

612
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,560
 I'm happy.

613
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,880
 Yes.

614
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,840
 Definitely, yes.

615
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,240
 I thought we kind of, you know,

616
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,600
 were you mad at us?

617
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,320
 Yeah, yes.

618
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,480
 I mean, it also goes without question.

619
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,600
 Badger is the best cat.

620
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,640
 Badger in the best.

621
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,520
 Oh, no.

622
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
 John Coxon, original poet.

623
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,720
 Badger is the best cat.

624
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,440
 I didn't say bad.

625
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,800
 He is.

626
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,320
 That's an original album.

627
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,360
 Esther is.

628
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,000
 She's the best.

629
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,320
 All the things we've said is she's telling us thing.

630
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,040
 And expecting us to respect.

631
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,920
 So, yes.

632
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,240
 So, and I for one, don't do a podcast so that people can remember what I say.

633
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,760
 So, one of the things about podcasts that have hundreds and hundreds of episodes

634
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,360
 is that the audience apparently expect the people on the podcast to remember what they

635
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,680
 said.

636
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,800
 But if you're the sort of person who does 500 episodes of a podcast,

637
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,760
 you're not the sort of person who remembers what they've already said.

638
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,160
 Oh, just like Freddy listeners listening who are thinking,

639
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,760
 "You're like missed 400 and 56 episodes of "The One of the Dawn."

640
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,920
 We have in fact only done 40 episodes.

641
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,960
 No, no, I'm just...

642
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,680
 Yeah, no.

643
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,240
 I know.

644
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,880
 Just curious.

645
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,080
 Listen, I'd like to say that's what machine learning is for.

646
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,120
 Does that have a question?

647
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,520
 Does that have a question at the end?

648
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,000
 No.

649
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,400
 No, no.

650
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,480
 Is that a machine learning?

651
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,920
 Yes, it's very easy.

652
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,560
 You can...

653
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,800
 It's very easy to do comments as questions because you say,

654
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,520
 "Do you think comment, question mark?"

655
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,400
 And it's I've learned this.

656
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,840
 I can't tell another comment to it.

657
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,800
 You can't.

658
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:44,160
 Okay, so can we have your letter of comment from big name fan and also a book author.

659
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,120
 Previous...

660
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,240
 Previous TAF winner, Lillian Edwards.

661
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,960
 When you get your report, when you're going to get your trip report out, ladies.

662
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,640
 Maybe next year.

663
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,840
 Sometimes you'll be after on a date.

664
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,480
 Anyway, where were you going?

665
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,680
 You could go back here almost twice in because this is what my PhD students

666
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,400
 got all their comments.

667
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:11,120
 You could build an avatar bot from author to the English if she learns from all of your

668
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,320
 characteristics.

669
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,880
 Quickly, yes.

670
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,160
 Oh, for fuck's sake.

671
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,600
 You know, just also like a Barbie talking dog.

672
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,160
 Yeah.

673
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
 You know, people that straight away go.

674
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,800
 So you'll say...

675
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,000
 I think the cat is the best cat.

676
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,880
 How much?

677
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,600
 How much opt forward we have to put Jesus.

678
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,640
 How... no, actually not going to be... Jesus.

679
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,480
 That's good.

680
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,440
 I like that.

681
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,800
 We just send that into the microphone.

682
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,560
 We should have put that much.

683
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,360
 Jesus is so...

684
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,160
 Cheeses and margaritians.

685
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,880
 Yeah, probably.

686
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,240
 You know, you're going to have some issues.

687
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,920
 And I'll be normalised as fine.

688
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,160
 Yeah.

689
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,560
 That's it.

690
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,480
 So I did tell Mark and Claire that when they all want to feed all the banana wings into an

691
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,040
 AI to resurrect them after they're gone.

692
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,560
 And after I've gone, probably.

693
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,240
 And then what we can do is we can have Claire make all decisions about British fandom

694
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,400
 and their absence because she's the only sense of...

695
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
 Claire has given you a pattington last seven.

696
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:58,720
 Yes.

697
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,160
 But I think she's doing it with love.

698
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,400
 I hope.

699
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,560
 Either that I'm going to get kicked up the backside later.

700
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,920
 So, you know, we'll find out.

701
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,960
 Two in the next episode.

702
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,240
 So any other comments, questions?

703
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,920
 Might start.

704
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,320
 You said earlier you've formed the live code amazing.

705
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,880
 You can't fast forward to the boarding bits.

706
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,240
 Is that how we're here this long?

707
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,760
 Oh, it's a good point.

708
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,760
 And it was a question.

709
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,320
 It was?

710
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:24,640
 Yeah.

711
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,680
 It's very good.

712
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,640
 Sandra Bond.

713
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,680
 It was a rhetorical question.

714
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,600
 Surely given the state of emptiness of the passage in front of you,

715
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,400
 I think the purpose of the beer is to create the boarding bits.

716
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,240
 That is what we refer to as a pointing tool.

717
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,280
 Sick.

718
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,640
 Was that a sick bird?

719
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,480
 I think we just got told.

720
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,920
 We did get told.

721
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,480
 Any more comments, questions?

722
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,040
 So from Ms. Claire Brownlee of Britain.

723
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,560
 It's been a while since you've done a letter of comment.

724
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,720
 I'd like to thank you for asking.

725
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,120
 I've taken your couple of people from earlier.

726
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,240
 And I would like to ask, what was that, you idiot?

727
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:10,400
 That was the Octa Thought podcast.

728
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,840
 And it's goodbye from me.

729
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,720
 It's goodbye from me.

730
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,640
 Goodbye from me.

731
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,920
 Cover any of you.

732
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,360
 If you've been affected by me.

733
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,280
 You can buy merch at them.

734
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,760
 Thank you very much to Margree for being on the podcast.

735
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,160
 Yes.

736
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,280
 It was a very good deal.

737
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,160
 Thank you.

738
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:57,120
 Keep reading.

739
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,480
 It's not going to be worse.

740
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,720
 It's not going to be worse than, like, it's not,

741
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,880
 this is not going to be a pristine.

742
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,480
 We're going to go into Octa Thought though,

743
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,520
 as soon as we start.

744
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,320
 Do we have a joke?

745
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,200
 Where are shadows?

746
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,080
 Are you up?

747
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,800
 What are you doing?

748
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,040
 That is the topic of cinema.

749
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:15,520
 Hello.

750
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,120
 How are you?

751
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,720
 Well, I'm awake.

752
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,520
 Hey!

753
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,040
 Are we doing this on Zoom?

754
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,800
 I think, I assumed we'd be doing this on Zoom.

755
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,720
 Alison thought we'd be doing it on Zoom,

756
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,440
 but it's sort of like a lot of effort, doesn't it?

757
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,760
 Anyway, I promise we'd shout, "Hi, Liz."

758
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,480
 Hi, Liz.

759
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,120
 Hi, Liz.

760
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,840
 So, Liz.

761
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,520
 You can't see this, but we're in the bar.

762
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,640
 We should do this.

763
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,680
 Welcome to Octa Thought, the podcast of getting pissed.

764
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,800
 Yes.

765
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,280
 And also, Armin Max.

766
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,320
 Did you get an Armin Max for this occasion, Liz?

767
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,240
 No, because I had one yesterday.

768
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:46,800
 Wow.

769
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,440
 How was it?

770
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,240
 Tell us everything.

771
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,760
 It was good.

772
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,880
 Almondy?

773
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,120
 I was expecting more than three words.

774
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,320
 Yeah, that's because she's only,

775
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,000
 "Have you had any coffee, sweetheart?"

776
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,200
 No!

777
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,240
 No, no, no.

778
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,440
 "Have you had any beer?"

779
00:46:59,440 --> 00:46:59,920
 Yeah.

780
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,560
 "Would you like?"

781
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,120
 "Would send you a coffee or some beer?

782
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,000
 "Which would you rather?"

783
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,480
 "If you were a..."

784
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,600
 Good morning.

785
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,080
 "If you were 100 men at Easter Corn

786
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,760
 "and Alice and Tex did you saying,

787
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,280
 "Are you up winky face?

788
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,560
 "What would you do?"

789
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,800
 "100 duck size then, that's ridiculous."

790
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:23,120
 I feel we've confused her about to sleep.

791
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,760
 [Laughter]

792
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,560
 It's a nice thing.

793
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,640
 So...

794
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,200
 [Laughter]

795
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,080
 Sorry, I can't be honest.

796
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,800
 I don't know.

797
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,560
 I'm texting men because I'm after a duck.

798
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,960
 I'm supposed to be really quiet, guys.

799
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,480
 [Laughter]

800
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,480
 We're not supposed to be really quiet.

801
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,880
 Yes, so...

802
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,000
 Oh, yeah, I know.

803
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,840
 Right, so welcome to Oxford,

804
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,080
 the podcast is staying up too late

805
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,320
 and drunkenly phoning people from bars.

806
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,080
 Welcome to the first one.

807
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,560
 I'm John Carson.

808
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,680
 I'm Alice and Scott.

809
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,800
 [Laughter]

810
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,160
 Liz, you're Liz Batty.

811
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,840
 This is my Jesus.

812
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,640
 [Laughter]

813
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,680
 This is quite confusing.

814
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,000
 [Laughter]

815
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,320
 This is where Liz goes.

816
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:02,960
 Jesus.

817
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,760
 [Laughter]

818
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,960
 So this is actually the first ever

819
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,160
 Oxford Liver convention with an audience

820
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,560
 and we're making a real good go at it.

821
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,600
 Who the audience are?

822
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,080
 The audience are Caroline,

823
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,960
 Claire, Mark and Spike,

824
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,760
 and also two very confused hotel staff and a rugby player.

825
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,480
 [Laughter]

826
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,800
 Yes.

827
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,520
 That is the complete list.

828
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
 [Laughter]

829
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,400
 It's a nice hotel.

830
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,760
 There's mushrooms for breakfast.

831
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,040
 Yeah, they're just pretty good.

832
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,520
 They're just not quite a plus.

833
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,240
 We miss you.

834
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,200
 We'd love to see you.

835
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,600
 We're sad that you're not with us.

836
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,560
 Hello, Thomas.

837
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,360
 Hi, Alice.

838
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,760
 Hi, Alice.

839
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:39,760
 Hi, what's up?

840
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,720
 Hi, what's up?

841
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,280
 What's up, Adam?

842
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,400
 Hello, Liz.

843
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,360
 Hello, Liz.

844
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,720
 Hello, Liz.

845
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,360
 Hello, Liz.

846
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,920
 Hello, Liz.

847
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,480
 John said you didn't want to be finished.

848
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,920
 No, don't touch me something.

849
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,760
 Shut my name a lot.

850
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,080
 Liz.

851
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,520
 And then you were going to do a fact.

852
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,960
 Oh, are we not supposed to be having like an actual recording?

853
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,840
 I thought we were going to record.

854
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,360
 John promised me he had the technology all sorted out.

855
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,560
 Which I think we need is recording.

856
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,000
 What's up somehow?

857
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,880
 Yep, on my eye.

858
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,520
 We are using John's eye pad on what's up.

859
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,560
 Can you take a photo of this very elaborate recording set

860
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,120
 for the chapter?

861
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,400
 Yeah, can you smile?

862
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,360
 Hang on, you're going to have to take a little bit of a smile.

863
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,240
 Lots of good mix.

864
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,800
 Hello, I'm doing a grimace, Liz.

865
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,680
 Grimace, surely.

866
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,520
 That's not what Caroline said.

867
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,440
 Just travel in places.

868
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,320
 I'm really sorry.

869
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,520
 Check, you're all into course.

870
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,640
 You almost certainly do not.

871
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,560
 Claire is ducking like it's World War 3.

872
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,760
 She's in a shelter.

873
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,280
 Okay, it'll be just like David.

874
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,800
 Not what you're doing this kind of kid.

875
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,400
 I'm happy with that.

876
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,760
 If I look like David Mitchell.

877
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,640
 Yeah, he's married to Victoria Carm Mitchell and that's...

878
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,520
 Oh, I do.

879
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,400
 Yeah, you do.

880
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,200
 Yeah, I'm a homo.

881
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,760
 What would I do?

882
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,400
 I'd say that.

883
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,560
 Liz, what do you do Victoria Carm Mitchell?

884
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,040
 It's what she would have wanted.

885
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,480
 Yeah, it's got my cake.

886
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:50,880
 What?

887
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,600
 Who's your type?

888
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,480
 Of the current taskmaster contestants, who is your type?

889
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,760
 Good question.

890
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,760
 Oh, interesting.

891
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,240
 Do you want to say it very well?

892
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,360
 Oh, Desiree, yeah.

893
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:03,840
 Fair enough.

894
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,280
 Yeah, there is a group consisting of...

895
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,960
 I would have gone for Alan Davis,

896
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,040
 but I think that says more about me than...

897
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,240
 Look, he's just got lots of very nice floppy hair and he's adorable.

898
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,240
 So, just a very attentive?

899
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,040
 Yes.

900
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,960
 And no, she would not be very attentive.

901
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,480
 She'd be more aggressive.

902
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,360
 More attentive.

903
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,000
 Yeah.

904
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,360
 Alan would just be lovely and he'd give you woolly slippers when you went to his house.

905
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,760
 Oh, David's just got to have a QA for 16 years.

906
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,000
 I think we'll see if you miss dressing out.

907
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,240
 So, I'm watching Alan Davis.

908
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,360
 But he wouldn't wonder it.

909
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,960
 Oh, that was weird.

910
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,920
 That whole 16- year thing was weird.

911
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,040
 So, we miss you.

912
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,640
 We are an actual convention with real people.

913
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,760
 So, did we have shown it?

914
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,400
 So, about...

915
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,840
 We do not have show-do's.

916
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,400
 Why would we?

917
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,920
 It's two fifteen in the morning and I've had so much beer.

918
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,520
 15, with the people with polar reads of an hour, I just told.

919
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:57,760
 That's better.

920
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,000
 And that was...

921
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,200
 That was all the thought-life in the bar,

922
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:02,880
 Yes.

923
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,560
 And it's goodbye from me.

924
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,760
 It's goodbye from me.

925
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,320
 And it's goodbye from a bunch of drunken fans.

926
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,360
 Yay!

927
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,920
 And this.

928
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,440
 No, I think Caroline's, I think it was much better.

929
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,400
 And that's the end of the episode.

930
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:16,800
 Who's...

931
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,400
 Bye.

932
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:18,880
 No.

933
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:25,360

 Beep.
