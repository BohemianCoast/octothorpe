1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
 I just bashed my microphone with my cup of coffee.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,520
 Hello everyone and welcome to a very special episode of Octa Thorpe.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,920
 So it's a very special episode of Octa Thorpe on which we are going to play if I ran the

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,600
 con, the smoth con 3 game.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:36,880
 So back story to this, in the mid 80s at smoth con 3, the idea came up to have a game which

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,520
 would simulate con running and so they wrote a little con running simulation game which

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,960
 I think has been played at quite a few smoth cons since then and certainly I played it at

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,240
 some point in the run up to the London Worldcon.

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,560
 I think Alison's played it as well but since either of us have played it, it's been through

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:03,320
 multiple editions but in 2015 when Sasquan had a guest of honour, Lesi Cherich who helped

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,600
 out in a row at least some of the original game, I think the first edition, basically

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,880
 they then expanded and updated fourth edition which I think is so only needed because certainly

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,000
 the version I played which was basically the first edition having gone through some corrections

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,960
 and so on, hadn't really been updated to take into account things like the internet.

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,280
 What kind of databases desktop publishing?

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,480
 Yeah, it felt very dated and it felt very, I thought it felt very American, I think actually

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,400
 it's not that it's very American, maybe it's just that it's very Worldcon and Worldcons

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,640
 were and still are quite American, you know, that's dropping but I mean at the time when

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,400
 I, we did the London Worldcon, you know, you're having maybe two every ten years that were

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
 not in the USA.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,240
 So, so it's basically a game about playing, running a convention.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,560
 I am going to be the secret master of fandom.

23
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,400
 We've known this for a while.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,320
 John and Alison are going to be my committee.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
 In theory you have multiple committees but we're going to play it through with one and

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,400
 see how many points they get and then you listeners can play at home and see if you

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,080
 can get more points than John and Alison in running a convention.

28
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,240
 We should tell people that this is available to buy and they can go and buy it at a link

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,360
 that will be in the show note and you can buy a paper coffee or you can do what we all

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,160
 did which was to buy the PDF which is I think five dollars, it's not very much.

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,720
 Yeah, it's very reasonable.

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,400
 It's very nice and yeah, it comes with everything you need to play it, all the instructions,

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
 everything and you can even print out cards to select the scenarios if you like.

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
 So in theory we have two or more teams.

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,080
 I did play it I think in, must be 2011 or 2012 with quite a lot of different teams.

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
 I can't remember that we scored very highly.

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,640
 I think we got very, we scored very well for giving everyone beer I think and running lots

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
 of parties.

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
 Hey!

40
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,760
 Yes, the idea is that the committees play and each committee will alternate someone being

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
 the chair.

42
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,840
 So you're going to make decisions as a committee but the chair has final say if you disagree.

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
 We never disagree.

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,600
 Oh no.

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,960
 We have three phases, the bidding phase, the planning phase and the at-com phase and in

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,680
 each of those phases we have a set of scenarios.

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,360
 You will select a scenario and I will start by reading you the kind of setup in that scenario.

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,440
 You will make decisions for yourself.

49
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,360
 Sometimes the decisions will be randomized by D6 and then we'll keep moving through that

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,680
 scenario where you know the decisions you make early on will have consequences.

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,000
 And in fact some of the decisions you make in scenarios in the bidding and planning phase

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,720
 will have at-com consequences.

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,800
 So what will happen is we will do each scenario and at the start of each phase you will get

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,680
 a set of resources and these resources are people points, financial points and goodwill

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,760
 points.

56
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,040
 And usually to take an action it may require people points or financial points.

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,520
 If you have them, if you do not have people or financial points and the action you would

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,800
 like to take requires them you can't take that action.

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,360
 And what you're aiming to get is mainly goodwill points.

60
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,120
 You really want goodwill points not to have negative financial points but also you will

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,960
 lose points if you have too much money because you actually don't want your convention to

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,120
 make too much money you want to spend it all.

63
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,360
 And really you want your people points to be positive because that means you had lots

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,000
 of helpers and they all had fun.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Yeah.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,560
 In reality there would be someone keeping score.

67
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,560
 In fact I'm going to be the secret master of fandom who also keeps score.

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,760
 Let's see how we get on.

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,680
 So I think we start with a bidding phase scenario.

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,160
 There are and we're going to probably do at least one bidding phase scenario maybe one

71
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,280
 or two planning phase scenarios and hopefully one or two at con phase scenarios depending

72
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,520
 on how long it takes.

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,200
 There isn't an official time limit but basically if I think you guys are taking too long to

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,560
 make a decision I'm going to start singing the countdown tune.

75
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,520
 Hey.

76
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,600
 I think this will instill the appropriate sense of urgency in you.

77
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
 This is very much an experiment.

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,320
 Listeners we have not tried this before.

79
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,280
 I as I said have played this game once and we didn't do a very good job of it and this

80
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,320
 is a new edition that none of us have played.

81
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,200
 So let's see how far we get and I will tell you who wrote each scenario is also has credit

82
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:25,320
 authors so I'll tell you who wrote each scenario as we get to it.

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,440
 The bidding phase I think we're probably going to play one scenario out of 12.

84
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,120
 Would you like to give me a randomly chosen number between one and twelve?

85
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,600
 Hey Siri give me a randomly chosen number between one and twelve.

86
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,680
 A random number between one and twelve is eight.

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
 Eight.

88
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,000
 I heard that.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,200
 We are doing scenario starting at number 3401 pre-supporting memberships.

90
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,960
 We are doing pre-supporting memberships in our notes.

91
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
 Pre-supporting memberships.

92
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
 Because this is a well-con.

93
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,840
 I mean I would say that this is we are never running a well-con.

94
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,080
 So do we need to find three so oh yeah.

95
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,240
 No no no you should not find 3401 because it will tell you what's going to happen.

96
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
 Okay fine.

97
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,440
 You're just going to tell us everything we need to know.

98
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
 Yes.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,360
 It's not like a smoth.

100
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,920
 What do you do about pre-supporting memberships?

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,760
 You can choose not to have them.

102
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,800
 Charge $10, charge $20 or charge $40.

103
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
 Erm.

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:34,480
 I assume you're a modern world-con here and so it's like more than world-con prices.

105
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
 Or rather 2015 anyway.

106
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
 Yeah we're going to charge $20.

107
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
 $20?

108
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,320
 Yeah $20 seems good.

109
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,640
 $40 seems too much and $10 seems too little so.

110
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,400
 Can't we have like a couple of friends tears and like supporters tears and things as well?

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
 Just $20.

112
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,600
 No you can only.

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,200
 I think what Alison is asking is can we make running the world-con slightly more complicated

114
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
 please.

115
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,240
 In return for a load of startup care.

116
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
 Er no.

117
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,160
 No okay right $20 we're going with $20.

118
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,640
 Alright we are charging $20.

119
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
 So $20.

120
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,680
 I'm just going to by the way this is a society I'm noting down kind of the route we take

121
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
 through this scenario.

122
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,200
 We are charging $20 so I go to that one.

123
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,880
 You gain income and committed supporters.

124
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,360
 We're charging three financial points and one goodwill point.

125
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,320
 Okay so we are on six and three now right?

126
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,720
 Because you said three and one.

127
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,840
 No gain three financial points and one goodwill point John.

128
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,440
 Oh so we're on five financial.

129
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,960
 But you're keeping a spreadsheet in the show notes so we don't need to individually do

130
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,320
 this because Liz is doing it for us.

131
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,040
 Well I'll do it or John can do it.

132
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,800
 I could do the points I'm happy.

133
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,920
 It'll keep me focused.

134
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,000
 I also realise that the art for this episode is going to be the branding for the convention

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 which we can't call Octicon.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,240
 Puctuation the world con.

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,160
 Alright so well done we have gained some finance and goodwill.

138
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,760
 Sorry you have gained some finance and goodwill.

139
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,720
 I obviously am neutral and do not care whether you do well or badly.

140
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,600
 So keeping track.

141
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,040
 You'll care where we're running the world con Liz.

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,200
 Keeping track of the pre-supportors cost you effort.

143
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,600
 Lose one people point.

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,880
 Are you going to give your pre-supportors a discount on the convention rates?

145
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
 No.

146
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
 Oh yes.

147
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,280
 They should have bought a friend membership shouldn't they?

148
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,120
 That we haven't sold them.

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,200
 Yeah no we are because otherwise we're going to lose a ton of goodwill.

150
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
 True.

151
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
 Fair enough.

152
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
 Yeah probably.

153
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,880
 Is it just this is just a yes or no at the moment.

154
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,200
 Yes you can say yes or you can say no.

155
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,280
 We're going to go with yes because it could be quite a small discount.

156
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,840
 Let's go yes and hope that we get the option for it to be a small discount.

157
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,440
 Remember when you decided to give your pre-supportors a discount on the convention rates lose three

158
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
 finance points.

159
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,080
 Oh what do we do that immediately or you remember it?

160
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
 We do that immediately.

161
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
 Oh man.

162
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,760
 Well you gained three and now you've lost three.

163
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,440
 Okay now roll a dice and give me the number between one and six please.

164
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,960
 I've rolled a two goblin.

165
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,400
 Everything works smoothly.

166
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
 Gain one goodwill point.

167
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
 Hey.

168
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,960
 And that is the end of the scenario.

169
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,720
 Have we time to do one more bidding one because that was pretty simple.

170
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
 I think we can do another bidding scenario because that was pretty short yeah and not

171
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
 the most interesting.

172
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,600
 We are going to do a scenario called Kill the Wabbit which is by Priscilla Olsen, John

173
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
 Pomeran, Sergio Turic and Mark Olsen.

174
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,320
 A newspaper article captures your attention.

175
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,680
 A rabbit breeders convention has just decided to hold its national convention aka Bunnycon

176
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,080
 in your locale.

177
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,800
 You happen to notice that the prospective convention date overlaps your own.

178
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,040
 Will the bunny birthers be a bitch?

179
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,600
 Sure enough your hotel rep calls you to tell you that the bunny birthers are very interested

180
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,880
 in using them as their major convention facility.

181
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,960
 In fact they have made an excellent upfront money offer of 20k to reserve space and the

182
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,280
 hotel wants you to match it within the week.

183
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,520
 If not they will give the hotel to the bunnies.

184
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,960
 Or in shock you thought you had an agreement but then your stun mind begins to function.

185
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,440
 Do you agree to match the payment?

186
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,080
 In which case you will lose two financial points or ask the hotel for a meeting to discuss

187
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
 this.

188
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
 Oh god.

189
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,000
 Well we think we've got a contract so like can we do you think the best plan is to try

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,920
 and get them to discuss it and then try and get them to stick to the original contract?

191
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,280
 Yeah let's have a meeting to discuss it.

192
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
 Let's have a meeting.

193
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,320
 A bit worried about this.

194
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,360
 Alison has a worried face now.

195
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
 I say now.

196
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,080
 Yeah because the meeting could go in a number of difficult ways.

197
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,920
 Anyway let's have the meeting.

198
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,760
 Alright roll to see the next answer.

199
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
 I get a 3.

200
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 That doesn't seem good.

201
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
 Nope that's fine.

202
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,320
 Sure they are willing to talk to you.

203
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,480
 If you're older one or two they just wouldn't talk to you and say no we want 20,000 so yeah.

204
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
 Jesus.

205
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,800
 When you meet with the hotel you make a strong pitch that your convention will be much better

206
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,320
 for the hotels and the bunnies.

207
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,920
 Just think of the cleaning bill.

208
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,680
 Roll to find out the hotel's answer.

209
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
 Five that doesn't sound good.

210
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
 Sorry the hotel likes you but it's a business decision.

211
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,760
 They want the money.

212
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,200
 No.

213
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,840
 So the hotel is holding firm and requiring a 20k payment to hold the space.

214
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,640
 Do you?

215
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
 Fold up the bid.

216
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
 Brackets.

217
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,440
 This will have dire consequences.

218
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,360
 Find a new site.

219
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,520
 Pay up if you have at least two financial points and you would lose those two financial

220
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,240
 points which you do but that would leave you with not much money.

221
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
 Decide not-

222
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
 But it's the end of the bidding stage.

223
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,680
 We're not going to do another scenario after this right?

224
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
 It's not.

225
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
 We're not going to do another scenario.

226
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,840
 We're going to move on to the convention phase.

227
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,080
 You could decide not to pay and see how it goes or look around for alternative facilities.

228
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,720
 The thing is that going into the convention phase with no financial points also seems

229
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
 like a bad thing.

230
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,120
 We're going to get some new ones.

231
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
 Do they?

232
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
 I assume they.

233
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,800
 I assume anything that we have carries over though so um equally.

234
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,880
 Yeah I assume you get extra so you'll get another two but also you also get extras for

235
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,600
 kind of- you basically will get the set amount it gives you in the beginning of the thing

236
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,840
 which is you'll get another two financial points for planning on one for Atcom.

237
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,040
 But then if you have- oh it's just three down here is that wrong?

238
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,680
 Oh sorry I was doing the wrong thing.

239
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,760
 No it's three I'm reading one for three committees and then basically if you have lots of goodwill

240
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,280
 you'll get more people and more money at different points.

241
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,320
 Probably changing the site this late is going to lose us goodwill.

242
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
 And money.

243
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,240
 It could easily cost more than 20k to switch sites.

244
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,520
 Yeah we probably just need to-

245
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,040
 I think we are just going to suck it up at this point probably.

246
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
 Yeah.

247
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
 As we can.

248
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,120
 So you're going to suck up and pay up and lose two financial points?

249
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,920
 Yeah fucking rabbit.

250
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,280
 Of course the news gets out to the finish room and Mill that you're having hotel problems.

251
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,760
 It doesn't matter that everything settled now.

252
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,240
 People here that your hotel didn't trust you and held you up for a big payment.

253
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,120
 Lose two goodwill points.

254
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,000
 Hey he he he.

255
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
 Oh no.

256
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,440
 So you lost two financial points and then you lose two goodwill points anyway.

257
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,840
 Oh I know why we've given it.

258
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,600
 I know why I've given up con running.

259
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,560
 Yeah you pay up and you're screwed anyway.

260
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
 That's hard.

261
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,320
 I don't know what you do with that.

262
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,400
 Yeah.

263
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,480
 This is what con running is like with sites.

264
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,720
 That's why you run virtual cons.

265
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,160
 That's probably a better path through.

266
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,760
 I mean there are better paths through which is you know you can if you try and find a

267
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,480
 new site sometimes it goes very badly and sometimes it goes better.

268
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,520
 If you keep going sometimes the the bunnies decide to go somewhere else and then you

269
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,520
 can switch back to your hotel unless you burned all your goodwill with the hotel and

270
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,520
 then you know if you've already got a new hotel do you go back to that hotel?

271
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,600
 It all just gets very tricky.

272
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
 There is there is a good path through it but again there's a lot of luck involved.

273
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,680
 So this was the bidding phase.

274
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,840
 You almost had your hotel swipe from under you and you did pre-supporting memberships

275
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,480
 but then gave them all the discount on the actual con.

276
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:35,120
 And so you've got some goodwill but not much finance.

277
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,160
 We're now entering the planning phase.

278
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,440
 So do our people and goodwill add to the numbers that are there?

279
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,760
 I'm pretty sure you get now basically the next line added up.

280
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,320
 So it's seven people, three finance and four goodwill.

281
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,800
 Yep and then you get an extra people point for every three goodwill points you have at

282
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,600
 the time rounding up so I think you get another two people points.

283
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 Excellent.

284
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,080
 That should make up for not having any money.

285
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
 Yeah.

286
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
 Yeah.

287
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,520
 So you've got nine people points and not much money.

288
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
 Yay.

289
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,760
 We just have to basically throw people at the problems rather than money in the next session.

290
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,120
 Sorry for the million.

291
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,560
 So we're going to enter the planning phase and in the planning phase there are 26 possible

292
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
 scenarios.

293
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,360
 We are going to do scenario 22, 01, the relationship.

294
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,000
 And relationship is in quotes.

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Their relationship.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 All right.

297
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Oh no.

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,920
 The head of the art show is pushing for a policy which would charge a percentage commission

299
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,600
 instead of a fixed panel fee.

300
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,320
 This is very unpopular with the rest of the committee.

301
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,760
 In spite of this opposition at the division head of exhibits inexplicably insists upon

302
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,680
 supporting the unpopular policy proposed by his area head to the extent there is repeated

303
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
 heated debate on the subject.

304
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,600
 Do you tell the division head that committee consensus must be followed?

305
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,040
 Do nothing now and hope that things settle down a few weeks or support the division head

306
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,760
 and allow the policy to be instituted.

307
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,040
 Percentage policy, right?

308
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
 That's what we're doing Britain.

309
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,800
 I don't know what we're doing Britain.

310
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
 Art shows 10%.

311
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,120
 Let's go with that one.

312
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
 All right.

313
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
 What could possibly go wrong?

314
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
 Yeah.

315
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
 What do you think, John?

316
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
 I think that's fine.

317
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
 I can't see it being.

318
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,560
 I really think this is just been blown out of proportion and we should just like simmer

319
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
 down.

320
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,040
 But also how do UK World cons do this?

321
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,720
 Do they go with a panel fee or a percentage fee?

322
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,560
 Because British conventions are always percentage fees.

323
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,040
 Yeah.

324
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
 That's interesting.

325
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
 I don't know.

326
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
 I had no idea.

327
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,600
 This is something I didn't know about.

328
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,200
 I didn't know about this either.

329
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,400
 I'm now looking up World con Art Show applications for 2024.

330
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,680
 I can't see what's going on.

331
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,320
 We're going to go with percentage on the ground so that's how it's done in Britain

332
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,480
 and I'm sure the art show head is right and it's got nothing to do with some secret relationship

333
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,520
 they're having with the exhibits head.

334
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,720
 Anyway, so we're going to support the division head and allow this policy to be instituted.

335
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,520
 Please, is that okay, John?

336
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
 Yeah.

337
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,800
 I think that makes sense to me.

338
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 Alright.

339
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
 Roll to find out how the committee reacts.

340
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
 Okay.

341
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,920
 D six is another three.

342
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,200
 A rumour surface is that division head and his art show area head have been enjoying a

343
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,480
 clandestine relationship.

344
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,080
 The shit hits the fan.

345
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,040
 Brackets the division head.

346
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
 The rest of the committee becomes convinced that the exhibits division head is merely the

347
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,240
 puppet of the art show head.

348
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,200
 The exhibits division head loses most of his effectiveness and credibility.

349
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,800
 It's one people point.

350
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 Oh no.

351
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,040
 Oh, we've got loads of those though, so that's fine.

352
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
 Do you?

353
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
 Yup.

354
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,360
 Fire both the exhibits division head and the art show head, in which case you will lose

355
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,240
 a further people point.

356
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,000
 Fire the art show head, do nothing or talk to both individuals and ask them to cool things

357
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,120
 down until after the problem has blown over.

358
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,520
 Oh, I don't know.

359
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
 What do you think?

360
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,720
 I think I probably want to fire someone because like it's not.

361
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,080
 I feel like if it's not a problem that they're dating with, they're not telling everyone

362
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,760
 that they're like dating and it's affecting the convention, that's going to be a problem

363
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
 down the road.

364
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,680
 What do you think, Galasan?

365
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,440
 Sometimes you move one of them, but if you've got a division head who's not performing,

366
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,640
 moving them to another division probably isn't the solution and that's not really one of

367
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,200
 the options we're given is to move one and not the other so they're no longer in a line

368
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
 of control.

369
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
 Yeah.

370
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,360
 We're not giving the option to fire the exhibits division head only and keep the art show head.

371
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,280
 Oh, so we can either fire the art show head or both.

372
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,160
 Yes, which I think is a bit of an error.

373
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,440
 You should be able to fire the division head.

374
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,760
 Because you should never fire the junior, should you?

375
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
 You should always.

376
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
 Yeah.

377
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,160
 I'm just thinking back to like real life World Cons.

378
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,600
 I know I've been on conventions where there's been a, you know, no couples on the committee

379
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,960
 policy, but not a no couples on the in the division policy, which is trickier.

380
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,160
 No, well, like the problem is like I said, I've been the problem is that there's a couple

381
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,480
 of the problem is that it's like a couple that are not being forthcoming with the fact

382
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,960
 that that's affecting if the, if the exhibits division head is going back for someone and

383
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,000
 not disclosing that there's like a conflict of interest there.

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
 That is when it starts getting into like trust issues with that division head.

385
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
 Yeah.

386
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,200
 Because you don't know whether they're doing the right thing or whether they're just going

387
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,200
 to do things for reasons you can't see.

388
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,200
 So if it's a choice between if we can't move that person, if we can't move the division

389
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,680
 head and we can't fire just the division head, I guess I favor firing both.

390
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,400
 But I was going to say I'm coming around to the idea that we just far both of them because

391
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
 we have a ton of people points.

392
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,920
 Actually they're a problem and it's possible that they can come back later, but we've

393
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:57,880
 already said we've already lost the credibility of the division head already.

394
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,040
 So I feel like we might as well just far them both.

395
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,200
 But with an asterisk that that might not be my choice to try to help being given better

396
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
 options.

397
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,440
 We're dissatisfied with the options given to us in this role playing scenario game.

398
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
 Yeah.

399
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,440
 Always, always true in all games of this kind and indeed real life.

400
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,320
 Well, to be honest, I think that so if we choose that one, you lose one people point

401
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,920
 and I think the response is possibly what would have happened if you just fired the

402
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,480
 exhibits division head anyway, which is rumours spread about committee instability.

403
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,400
 Lose one goodwill point.

404
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
 No.

405
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
 Yeah.

406
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,000
 I think that's not a bad outcome.

407
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
 Even the amount of stuff that could happen.

408
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,920
 Okay, we're going to have another planning phase.

409
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,280
 We are going to have another planning phase scenario.

410
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,720
 Oh no.

411
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,480
 For our second planning scenario, we are playing the BNF by Priscilla Olsen, Fred I6 and Lizzie

412
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
 Turret.

413
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
 Hey.

414
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,880
 A big name fan, BNF in your area, recently turned pro, wants to run the Hugo Awards ceremony

415
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
 right.

416
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,880
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

417
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,240
 He is known to be a loud mouth, rubs people the wrong way.

418
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,800
 So far he's given out lots of advice but never attended a work session or taken on even

419
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 minor responsibility.

420
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,080
 You have reeled out about his competence.

421
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,360
 On the other hand, he's a major figure in local fandom and is assuming that he has his

422
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,720
 pick of jobs for the cop.

423
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
 Do you?

424
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
 No.

425
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,600
 Explain that this job must go to someone with more experience.

426
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,120
 Wait and see whether he starts showing more interest in the con as a whole.

427
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,760
 Bouch the inevitable and offer him the job, plan to keep a close eye on him or ask him

428
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,320
 what he has in mind.

429
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,920
 Erm, it's got to be either, I feel like it for me, it's wait and see you'll ask him.

430
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,120
 It's definitely not.

431
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,640
 Ask him seems too nice.

432
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,520
 Wishing and seeing.

433
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,280
 Oh, waiting and seeing is just hiding for disaster.

434
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,000
 I would ask in a kind of, oh, we hear you're interested in this.

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,720
 Can you send us a position paper by datex saying what your plans are?

436
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,200
 And then when that doesn't come, you can give the job somebody else, which is kind of

437
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,840
 what asking what his plans are.

438
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,080
 Erm, so that's the last option, right?

439
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,400
 Yeah, okay, let's do that.

440
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
 I'm up for that.

441
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,160
 Alright, so you ask him what he has in mind.

442
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
 Please roll.

443
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
 Six.

444
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,760
 That's six.

445
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,400
 He has reasonably good ideas, but there's one hitch.

446
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,000
 He really wants to invite his colleague and good friend, Dick Heller, to be the Hugo

447
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,720
 ceremony MC.

448
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
 This gentleman has never been seen going on stage sober and is known to be even more

449
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,040
 obnoxious drunk than he is sober.

450
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
 Now what?

451
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
 Pass.

452
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,040
 Agree and accept both your BNF and Heller.

453
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 Turn down this dynamic duo or try to get the BNF to select someone else.

454
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,480
 Erm, the third option.

455
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,460
 I'd go ssssssssss, yes see.

456
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,920
 Try and get this BNF to select someone else.

457
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,040
 Okay, please roll.

458
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,400
 Okay...

459
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,660
 FIVE!

460
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,260
 The BNF won't give up the plan to use Heller.

461
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:10,480
 What's worse, he already told Heller that he's on the consideration for the job and has invited Heller to participate.

462
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,640
 Now what?

463
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,500
 We're all quinching 'cause this sounds painfully familiar, doesn't it?

464
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,260
 Yup!

465
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,180
 (laughs)

466
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,540
 Two options- okay.

467
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,760
 You grit your teeth and tell him that he had no authority to make such an appointment,

468
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,960
 and insist to explain to Heller that it's all a mistake.

469
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
 Now there's no way you will appoint him to the position.

470
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,860
 Or you figure that now your stock will try to make the best of it.

471
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,960
 Maybe you can get him to invite a better speaker to serve as the MP,

472
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,420
 MC, and relegate Heller just to the actual UQG award presentations.

473
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,400
 No, it's gonna be the first of those.

474
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,640
 'Cause otherwise we know what's gonna happen because we've sat there while it happened.

475
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,800
 Yeah, I'm just- I'm- I'm um...

476
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,920
 So this came out in 2015, which was before

477
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,080
 like a lot of the code of conduct revolutions we've had in the scene.

478
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,120
 And yeah, no, not a chance in hell I'm gonna let an obnoxious drunk guy

479
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,600
 be involved on stage at the UQGos.

480
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,680
 Uh, so that's a hard pass.

481
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,360
 Alright, so explain he had no authority to make that appointment,

482
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,920
 and you will no way have him in the position.

483
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
 He's got a big fan base, oh god!

484
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,720
 (laughs)

485
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,360
 And- and then I hide under the table because it's very awkward and I don't like it.

486
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,280
 Heller is offended.

487
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,040
 Lose one goodwill point.

488
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,320
 (gasps)

489
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,280
 Well, just straight off, blind me.

490
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,640
 And we're not finished yet,

491
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,760
 'cause that was- it leads to a further section.

492
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,320
 You now have to find someone else to run the UQG awards ceremony.

493
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,080
 Lose two people points.

494
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,880
 Okay, that's fine.

495
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,400
 Got people for days, mate.

496
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
 Hmm, not the way we're going.

497
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 What is worse, you now have a well-known fan in touch with your committee

498
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,360
 who is not on your side.

499
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,960
 Every time there is a glimmer of a problem within the committee,

500
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,280
 he's on his phone to his favourite news-in-editor,

501
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,240
 telling all.

502
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,080
 Lose one goodwill point.

503
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,960
 Oof.

504
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,720
 Yeah, no, the mightglies special.

505
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,760
 (laughs)

506
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,480
 That's quite a good one.

507
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,760
 There's a lot- there's a lot of different ways this could go.

508
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,560
 But if we had him,

509
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,160
 that'd be like little time bomb waiting for the convention.

510
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,040
 Yup.

511
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,400
 So, uh, do you want to do one more planning phase one?

512
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,440
 Yeah, okay.

513
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,360
 Some of them have to be good, right?

514
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,160
 No.

515
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,720
 (snorts)

516
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,000
 I wonder if you might have had a-

517
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,640
 (laughs)

518
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,840
 a good thing.

519
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,680
 Again, this does feel very realistic.

520
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,120
 It does, actually.

521
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,040
 I think it always did feel quite realistic,

522
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,000
 and that's a good way.

523
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,200
 In a kind of-

524
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,840
 everyone should play this game a couple of times before deciding to run a world card.

525
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,120
 All right, let's play scenario we're in the money,

526
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,320
 which was definitely written in 2015.

527
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,760
 This is written by Glenn Glazer and Lazy Chiric,

528
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,600
 and I think Glenn Glazer was the chair or involved in Sasquam.

529
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,080
 A political group has started paying serious attention to a voted award you give,

530
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,240
 the prestigious Cithers Award.

531
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,440
 They've rallied their followers,

532
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,040
 and in response, people of opposite politics rallied their followers in opposition.

533
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,320
 Besides headaches for your election administrators and social media teams,

534
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,960
 this situation has also buried registration under an unprecedented deluge of what you call

535
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,000
 voting memberships.

536
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,560
 These entitle the member to vote, but not to attend the con,

537
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,040
 and unless they specifically ask otherwise,

538
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,840
 they receive electronic publications and not print ones.

539
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,760
 This in turn means an unprecedented amount of money to budget with.

540
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,840
 So you're in the money.

541
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,760
 Gain six financial points from all of these unexpected memberships.

542
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,800
 Woohoo!

543
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,200
 Wait, nothing can go wrong.

544
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,280
 I wasn't paying attention in 2015, guys.

545
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,600
 It's not the worst problem to have.

546
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,200
 It's not the worst problem to have.

547
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,520
 Sugarplums dancing the dreams of your division heads

548
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,120
 as your finance team wants about overspending even the surplus you have.

549
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,240
 Oh, that is the worst problem to have.

550
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,360
 Do you?

551
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,800
 You've got four options here.

552
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,360
 Go conservative by keeping to the original budget

553
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,120
 and just enhancing a few line items.

554
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,520
 Do the traditional thing cons do with last-minute income

555
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,640
 spend it on food and beverage?

556
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,720
 Allow exhibits to rent the entire prop and wardrobe set

557
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,080
 from the popular TV show Game of Privy's as they want to.

558
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,160
 Or do you allow events to stage a live concert

559
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,880
 featuring S.F. author Peter Peacock and his heavy metal band Pigeon Wind.

560
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:21,240
 I went to the last of these in 1987 when that was how old were you then, John?

561
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,040
 Minus one.

562
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:29,080
 But I went to see Peter Peacock, Peter Peacock and his heavy metal band Pigeon Wind.

563
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,600
 Though in fact, it's Pigeon Lords when Peter Peacock plays with them.

564
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,440
 I mean of those I'd probably go for option B, but...

565
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,320
 Yeah, as I'd like option B please.

566
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,680
 Yeah.

567
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,840
 I mean you know what we're like guys, right?

568
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,480
 Alright, so we're spending it on food and beverage.

569
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,960
 That's right.

570
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,120
 Though I mean having said that I did run an easter con

571
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,440
 where the entire purpose of running the easter con was to bring a band I like to play.

572
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,480
 So the facilities people provide menus and their

573
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,800
 dreams of lobster and caviar in the staff den.

574
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,520
 You figure you can spend about half your windfall on food.

575
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,880
 Do you?

576
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,080
 Do you want to do?

577
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,520
 Modously increase food and drink items across the board.

578
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,880
 Put it into the con suite or ramp up private events like staff den

579
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,120
 and the scissors award ceremony pre-reception.

580
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,640
 And you're going to do one in this case.

581
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,880
 Across the board, I would.

582
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,640
 What would you do, Alison?

583
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,960
 I think I'm going to do it across the board.

584
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,440
 Yeah.

585
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,520
 Alright, please remember modest food.

586
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,200
 But modest increased food.

587
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,480
 Yeah, yes modest increased food.

588
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,680
 But please remember you did that because it will come back at con.

589
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,440
 Oh no, modest food.

590
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,960
 Just this could be more.

591
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,040
 There was something else we had to remember on a food on it.

592
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,440
 So, you know.

593
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,280
 I don't think we have to because we...

594
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,200
 And have we spent our three finance points?

595
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
 Or is that something that's coming back at the con?

596
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,640
 Which finance points?

597
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,800
 It said you could spend half your windfall.

598
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,560
 Oh no, you haven't, you haven't spent that yet.

599
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,640
 Alright, so do you want to spend more of your windfall money?

600
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,560
 Choose one you haven't chosen before.

601
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,320
 And your two options are basically renting all the props and

602
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,680
 wardrobe from Game of Privy's or having the live concert.

603
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,320
 I'm going to guess that either of those can increase goodwill,

604
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,160
 but they could also go wrong.

605
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,920
 I mean, if I was doing it in real life,

606
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,000
 I'd probably go for the Game of Privy stuff on the basis

607
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,320
 that we might attract some people to the convention

608
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,360
 who wouldn't normally come and we might grow the community a bit.

609
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,720
 And I think the gig won't really move the needle on much,

610
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,040
 but I might be wrong.

611
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,920
 I mean, I think the Hawk Wind gig really,

612
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,080
 you know, it was something that people talked about

613
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,360
 four years afterwards.

614
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,000
 It wasn't, you know, it did kind of do its job,

615
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,560
 but I'm not sure how many people it brought into the convention,

616
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,640
 whereas having a lot of stuff from Game of Privy's.

617
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,640
 I remember at 2014 when the committee,

618
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,440
 the board were kind of like,

619
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,920
 "Oh, I don't know if we want to get the throne because,

620
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,640
 because everyone's seen it before a lot of times."

621
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,640
 The Privy, I mean, ever...

622
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,160
 And I'm not sure about having a big Privy in the middle of the van village,

623
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,400
 you know, but in fact, the giant Privy was extremely popular

624
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,880
 with lots of fans, including lots of kind of,

625
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,920
 actually, smuffy fans.

626
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,800
 It wasn't just that the random members of the convention,

627
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,680
 it was everybody.

628
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,840
 So I'm going to get the props and costumes from the Game of Privy's.

629
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,040
 That sounds good.

630
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,440
 But not more than three finance points worth of them.

631
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,280
 I am not sure we're going to get to pick, but yeah, I agree with that.

632
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,360
 Let's have a giant Privy in the van village.

633
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,920
 That sounds good.

634
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,680
 People could queue up to use it.

635
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,400
 Right, so we spent modestly on food,

636
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,320
 which by the way, we have not spent yet, but we'll spend that calm.

637
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,720
 And then you're going to let exhibits rent all the proper wardrobe sets from Game of Privy's.

638
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,080
 Yep.

639
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,600
 Now I'm a spin back to the Game of Privy's bit.

640
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,680
 Everyone in exhibits is super excited and gets to work immediately.

641
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,080
 Roll.

642
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,800
 Five.

643
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,440
 The studio is cautiously interested.

644
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,240
 They name a prize for the rental and shipping of the artifacts of the show.

645
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,520
 It's a big number representing most of your windfall income.

646
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,440
 Do you say yes and sign the contract, in which case you lose four financial

647
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,520
 points or get cold feet and consider other options instead?

648
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,400
 Four financial points seems like that seems good to me.

649
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,120
 Yeah, let's go with the four financial points.

650
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,000
 You've got loads of money.

651
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,760
 What could go wrong?

652
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,680
 Why not?

653
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,320
 All right, roll.

654
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,760
 So we've lost four financials.

655
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,400
 So we're down to five financial points.

656
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,200
 And I'm rolling a four.

657
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,240
 A four.

658
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,120
 All right, things go smoothly.

659
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,120
 Hey, please remember, Privy's props.

660
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,920
 Okay, the art for this episode is now going to be a job Privy in the fan village.

661
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:46,680
 Can you paint me and John on the Privy in the manner of, I think, what is still my

662
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,480
 Facebook profile photo where I think John is sitting on me on the Privy?

663
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,720
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

664
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,880
 [laughs]

665
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,160
 It might have to be all three of us on the job Privy though, I think.

666
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,440
 That is fair.

667
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,800
 That's all right, you could have one of you poking around there.

668
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,160
 We'll find a way to do it.

669
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,960
 But we're not finished with Game of Privy yet.

670
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,880
 Someone at the studio is a fan.

671
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,320
 They love your card and want to help.

672
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,200
 Not only can you get the props, you can get most of the cast as well.

673
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,560
 There will be a slight extra cost though.

674
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,280
 You can either, we've struck entertainment gold,

675
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,800
 lose one financial point and say yes or politely decline.

676
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,320
 Yeah, no, we're going to shake it.

677
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,640
 Yeah.

678
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,080
 We are going to be overrun with 10,000 Game of Privy's fans, but we'll cope.

679
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,520
 It's all right because they will offset the sad puppies in the scissors voting or whatever

680
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,720
 the award's called.

681
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:46,040
 They will and also, I have been to parties run by the Game of Privy's fan club and they are awesome.

682
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,120
 All right, we say yes to the cast, Liz.

683
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,720
 To them, please also remember as well as Privy's props.

684
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,160
 Remember, Privy's cast.

685
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,960
 Did we have to take a point off for...

686
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,280
 You have to take a point off, yeah.

687
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,880
 So we're actually down to four.

688
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,360
 And now you have another choice if you want.

689
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,680
 Do you want to have your live concert?

690
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,920
 Right, no, we are not going to have the live concert.

691
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:12,600
 This was a hopefully, hopefully Peter Peepcock won't get too upset with us.

692
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,640
 I absolutely love, by the way, that Michael Moorcock's Facebook told him he couldn't call

693
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,760
 himself Jerry Cornelius.

694
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,520
 So he changed his dayboard Facebook to Buggyly Otherly, which is another Moorcock character.

695
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,160
 It's quite good.

696
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:32,680
 I'm just checking, I'm playing this correctly because obviously there will be a sort of point

697
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,720
 where we come back.

698
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:41,800
 So you now have basically a suspended @com scenario, which I can resume at any point in the @com phase.

699
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,840
 Okay.

700
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,280
 You're going to resume it at the most inconvenient point, aren't you?

701
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,440
 Well, Murphy is allowed to resume it, which I think means I am allowed to resume it at the most

702
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,720
 inconvenient point.

703
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,800
 And I may have some information about how much money you've spent.

704
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,200
 Anyway...

705
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:07,880
 Shall we move on to the convention?

706
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,080
 I think we should.

707
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,040
 Yes.

708
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,440
 So we're going to add the five and the four and the one to our @com.

709
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,000
 Yes.

710
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,360
 Yes.

711
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:24,680
 So you're at @com money and also there is a special note, which is for every three good

712
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,800
 will points, you add one financial point.

713
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,920
 We do not have... does it round up or down Liz?

714
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,040
 It rounds up.

715
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
 Oh, so we get one financial point.

716
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,440
 Nice.

717
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,560
 So you're low on goodwill, but you're quite high on people and money, so that's good.

718
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,640
 We can throw some cash at this one.

719
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,920
 Let's try this one, which I think will be quite short and funny.

720
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,000
 We're going to play The Lady and the Snake by Mark Alton and Lesi Turic.

721
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,120
 I think that's quite an old one.

722
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,640
 That's one from the original one.

723
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,840
 Do you remember the scenario or do you just remember the actual situation?

724
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,600
 No, no, no, not enough.

725
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:56,920
 Okay.

726
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:02,520
 The lady in the snake, a lady wearing a snake, is reported in the hotel lobby.

727
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,160
 The hotel is concerned, do you?

728
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,720
 Tell the hotel to go ahead and remove them, send out ops looking for them, or ignore the situation.

729
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
 Well, the hotel can piss off, right?

730
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,720
 Because they charge us an extra 20 grand, so they should be nice to us.

731
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,640
 So I'm not letting the hotel do nothing.

732
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,240
 So what are the last two?

733
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,840
 Yeah, okay.

734
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,280
 So now a day, I mean, so we definitely say there's a code of conduct issue, and if we send...

735
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,600
 'Cause...

736
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,480
 Well, only if she's only wearing a snake.

737
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,480
 No, I mean, I think it's a live animal at the convention, and we're definitely not having pets

738
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,560
 attack her. But it could be, but it could be a service snake.

739
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,560
 No, it could not be a service snake, they're wild.

740
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,680
 They're not trainable, not bloody service snake, come on.

741
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,280
 Well, it's possible someone would argue with you about that, but anyway, that is not an option.

742
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,240
 You can either, if you're not sending the hotel, you can send out ops to look for them or ignore it.

743
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,440
 We're going to send ops to look for them.

744
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,920
 Or we could ignore it, we could just ignore it.

745
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,720
 What'd you think, John?

746
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,320
 He's too busy googling service snakes.

747
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,280
 I'd probably...

748
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,240
 Yep, it turns out that snakes can be official emotional support animals,

749
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,320
 so it is entirely possible that it is one.

750
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,720
 Have found that out.

751
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,800
 Did not know, but did suspect.

752
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,480
 Yeah, I knew you'd...

753
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,040
 You had that "I am googling" now, look on your face.

754
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,280
 Yeah, well, I was curious.

755
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,960
 I think, like, it depends, right?

756
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,240
 'Cause if someone's setting a python on attendees, we need to be aware of that.

757
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,200
 So we should probably send ops just to have like a little quick look to make sure that's not the case.

758
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,600
 But if it's just a lady with world-behaved snake...

759
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,000
 Not, I don't know.

760
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,160
 But I think we need to be aware either way.

761
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,440
 Right, yeah, no, we're going to check, so we're going to send out ops to have a look.

762
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,040
 All right, you have...

763
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,480
 Could not go possibly wrong, right?

764
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,920
 Sent ops looking for them.

765
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,680
 This could not go possibly wrong, right?

766
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,600
 And they get eaten.

767
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,320
 Instructions to the searches were unclear.

768
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,560
 Nobody planned what to do when the snake was found.

769
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,280
 So the lady and snake wind up being brought to ops.

770
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:07,160
 [Laughter]

771
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,440
 Yup, no, that would happen.

772
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,480
 That would definitely happen.

773
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,240
 [Laughter]

774
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,080
 Entirely legitimate.

775
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,080
 All right, please roll to find out what happens to the snake.

776
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,560
 One.

777
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,600
 One.

778
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,200
 Someone from program happens to be in ops and offers to put the lady and the snake

779
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,800
 into a herpetology discussion group.

780
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,200
 Do you accept the offer with release or relief or turn down the offer?

781
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,880
 100% accept.

782
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,600
 Yeah, like that's just a win for us.

783
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:42,040
 I'm not sure it is because I have vague feelings about some of the ways in which this one goes wrong.

784
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,200
 Have you even seen the film snakes at a con?

785
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,160
 [Laughter]

786
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,360
 So you're accepting the offer of a herpetology discussion group?

787
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,840
 Yup.

788
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:55,160
 I mean, hang on, now, before I do that, what is a herpetology and why do we discuss it?

789
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,920
 Reptile science.

790
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,640
 Yeah.

791
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,160
 Yeah, that seems good.

792
00:37:59,160 --> 00:37:59,880
 All right.

793
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,000
 That had considered a scenario where John has not heard the word herpetology before, but you know,

794
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,400
 you'll want to taste 10,000.

795
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,080
 It's an educational game.

796
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,080
 All right, you gain two good will points for a fascinating program item.

797
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,160
 Hey, see?

798
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,560
 We were only on two before, now we're on four.

799
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,360
 Ooh.

800
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,800
 And then roll to find out what happens next because the snake is still here.

801
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,960
 [Laughter]

802
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,280
 All right, watch me roll a one, guys.

803
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,360
 I've rolled a four, Liz, by the way.

804
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,080
 You've got four.

805
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,120
 All right.

806
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,320
 Some...

807
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,440
 He eats everyone.

808
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,680
 Sometime later, the snake is found curled up on a sofa in the sufferer suite.

809
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,640
 [Laughter]

810
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,200
 Do you call the hotel to take care of it,

811
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,760
 send ops to do something about it, or ignore it?

812
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,640
 After all, it doesn't seem to be bothering the fans.

813
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,760
 Uh, what, where is the option for locate the lady whose snake is?

814
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,680
 [Laughter]

815
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,840
 I'm going to send ops to do something about it.

816
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
 You can't locate people at the world, God.

817
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,520
 Yeah, that seems like very much an ops thing that ops should do.

818
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,800
 We sent ops to take care of it.

819
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,640
 It's just not going to go well.

820
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,080
 Uh, roll to find out if ops succeed.

821
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,920
 [Laughter]

822
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,640
 Six.

823
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,440
 They don't.

824
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,800
 Snake gets away.

825
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,880
 Roll to find out what happens next.

826
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,280
 I think you can possibly get an infinite snake loop here,

827
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,640
 so let's see if we can break out.

828
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,160
 Okay, so it's my roll.

829
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,440
 What happens next?

830
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,200
 Three.

831
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,480
 Three happens next.

832
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,400
 Uh, snake is found wrapped around real two of Star Wars.

833
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,600
 Do you call the hotel, send ops, or ignore it?

834
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,400
 Send ops.

835
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,080
 We're going to send ops.

836
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,760
 We'll keep sending ops until they fix it.

837
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,320
 All right, let's send ops again.

838
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,240
 All right, one more roll, please.

839
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,360
 That's a four.

840
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,080
 You're old for it.

841
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,600
 The snake gets away.

842
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,840
 Roll to find out what happens next.

843
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,160
 Oh, technically we should have been in an extra roll here,

844
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,200
 and I realize I've missed out.

845
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,640
 Uh, one.

846
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,520
 One.

847
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,120
 Okay, roll again.

848
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,840
 Is that Alison's turn now?

849
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,920
 Six.

850
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,840
 Sometime later, the snake is found receiving a whole costume award.

851
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:12,200
 Again, do you call the hotel, send ops, or ignore it?

852
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,160
 Send ops.

853
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,960
 Eventually they've got to be able to do something.

854
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,720
 Send ops, is there anything ops ever does about this?

855
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,160
 Yeah, if you don't roll terribly, they're not,

856
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,000
 you know, do opsy things.

857
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,320
 I've rolled a six, but we know what happens with a six.

858
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,200
 So should I roll again?

859
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,080
 Um, roll one more time, yeah.

860
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,880
 Four.

861
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,680
 Yeah, it's the same one.

862
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,640
 All right, should we have the other option from ops?

863
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,680
 You roll the one.

864
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,920
 Ops succeeding, capturing the snake to the cheers

865
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,120
 of the assembled multitudes.

866
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,240
 The snake has moved to ops.

867
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,720
 Aah!

868
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
 And efforts are made to contact the owner.

869
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
 Lose one people point.

870
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,120
 As it ends a person.

871
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,800
 And in theory, you can go, you can go round around again with the snake,

872
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,680
 just endlessly calling ops to try and capture the snake

873
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,120
 and then escape the game again.

874
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,840
 But let's assume the lady retrieves the snake from ops

875
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,520
 and is never heard from again.

876
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,560
 Hurrah!

877
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,840
 Okay, that was just a good time for everyone.

878
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,880
 I'm just for interest.

879
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,920
 What happens if you get the hotel to kick them out of the first place?

880
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,280
 Uh, if you get the hotel to do it.

881
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,640
 Hang on spoilers.

882
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,160
 I want to, I want to spoil it for next time I do this, uh, game.

883
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,840
 Because we might play, we, there is some merit in just playing this again,

884
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,720
 every time we need a...

885
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,600
 Yeah, but we won't do the same scenario again,

886
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,480
 there would we?

887
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,640
 We won't do the same smoth either.

888
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,320
 And eventually you can get, you can basically get stuck in a big loop.

889
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,080
 We could be a committee as the three of us,

890
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,920
 we get a, get Esther to be a smoth.

891
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,160
 Okay, we're going to do another at-con thing.

892
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,960
 We are going to go and see what happened with all of those decisions you made precon

893
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,480
 about your spending money.

894
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,880
 So, you have modest food.

895
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,160
 So remember when you decided to spend some of your windfall income

896
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,560
 to modestly increase food and drink items across the board?

897
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,560
 People seem mostly happy.

898
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,880
 There are some rumours of secret concom stashes,

899
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
 but no one really takes them seriously.

900
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,560
 Lose three financial points.

901
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,320
 Okay, that makes sense.

902
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,440
 That's what it said it was asked.

903
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:08,920
 Yeah, that's what we wanted to do.

904
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,760
 That is performing us advertised.

905
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,000
 We're down to four financial points listeners,

906
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,200
 but it should be fine.

907
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,800
 How could we possibly need more money than that?

908
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,240
 Game of Privies.

909
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,520
 Remember when you paid to bring in the props of Game of Privies?

910
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,120
 Roll.

911
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,680
 Oh, I think it's Alice and Turn.

912
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,000
 Full.

913
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,840
 It was worth the expense.

914
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,880
 Everyone ooze and ooze of the gorgeous costumes and realistic props.

915
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,560
 And of course, everyone wants their chance to have their picture taken on the full size,

916
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,560
 replica porcelain throne.

917
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,000
 Game two good world points.

918
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,840
 Hey.

919
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,600
 And remember...

920
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,800
 We're up to six.

921
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,400
 Remember when you paid to bring in the cast of Game of Privies?

922
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,280
 Yup.

923
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,720
 How does that go?

924
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,040
 Roll.

925
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,960
 Five.

926
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,960
 Many of your attendees are thrilled,

927
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,040
 but others are appalled that you have turned the world con into a media convention.

928
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,840
 Lose one good world point.

929
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,280
 Oh for fuck's sake.

930
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,760
 Fuck 'em.

931
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:10,680
 Everything that's wrong with our community encapsulated in a sentence.

932
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,400
 Yeah, because people get into science fiction by watching shows like Game of Privies.

933
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,000
 Disappointed by how real life is not like Westeros.

934
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,600
 Alright, so that was a pretty good outcome I think for your extra cash.

935
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,320
 Yeah.

936
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

937
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,440
 We're now, we're now sitting pretty actually.

938
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,720
 Because I'd say four on finance would be a defendable outcome.

939
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,320
 So shall we do one more at Con Scenario to see if I can make you lose all your money?

940
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,520
 Yay.

941
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,000
 Let's spend a little bit more money, get some goodwill.

942
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,040
 What about the dungeon master?

943
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,880
 That sounds like a good one for us.

944
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,640
 Yes, I'm down.

945
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:51,000
 Ah, we're going to do Scenario 1101, The Dungeon Master by Joe Rico.

946
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,080
 It is Saturday morning and you and your cohorts are pouring caffeine into yourselves

947
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,680
 in an effort to convince the rest of the convention that you're not dead.

948
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,000
 All Friday nights you have been hearing reports

949
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,440
 that four strange mundane looking types had registered at the door.

950
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,280
 This foursome had then spent most of their time showing a picture of some kid to various

951
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,960
 fan in the games room.

952
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,600
 Someone mentions that a couple had tried to play some D&D,

953
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,520
 but had proven to be rank novices.

954
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,480
 Now the foursome is in the hotel coffee shop and their leader is coming up to you.

955
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,480
 My name is Club, Cow Club.

956
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,760
 I'm a PI.

957
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,080
 I and my associates are looking for Dennis Dork, a 12 year old genius who has last seen in his

958
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,760
 MIT dorm room two months ago.

959
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,920
 We have reason to believe that Dork, a D&D fanatic, is attending your sci-fi convention.

960
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,600
 Your convention is responsible for Dork in local parentis wise.

961
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,120
 We expect your full cooperation or criminal and civil remedies may be applied.

962
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,840
 You have two questions to answer.

963
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,560
 Is Club right? Are you or your convention responsible for a runaway child at your convention?

964
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,520
 And what are you going to do about finding Dork, if anything?

965
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,680
 Is Dork a member of the convention?

966
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,800
 Do you agree with Club that you are liable for his presence?

967
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,480
 Disagree with Club or want more information on the penalties by consulting a member of your

968
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,280
 committee who is a lawyer, in which case you meet him at noon and you lose one people point?

969
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,040
 Ah, less lawyer.

970
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,160
 Definitely lawyer.

971
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:11,960
 Oh my god.

972
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,600
 We lawyer up.

973
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,520
 Okay, lose a people point.

974
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,720
 Deal.

975
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,720
 Alright, we're all six.

976
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,000
 We were on seven.

977
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,120
 Attorney Rick Lates can be found in the pool where he is in charge of the jacuzzi track of program.

978
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,280
 He listens as you tell of your meeting with Club.

979
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,400
 He considers your problem carefully and then renders his opinion.

980
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,240
 Simple answer, Club is full of hot air.

981
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,080
 In local parentis is a principle that is not half as meaningful today as in the past.

982
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,520
 As far as the con goes, we never assume responsibility for any attendee is other than

983
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,560
 kids in babysitting.

984
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,200
 However, you and I know that miners come to our con without supervision and we would never want

985
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,480
 any type of litigation.

986
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,000
 My advice, is how Club you don't consider yourself liable in the least, but as concerned citizens,

987
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,840
 you would be happy to aid in any attempts to find this lost child.

988
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,120
 Yep, let's do that.

989
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,760
 Thanking him, you give a two litre bottle of Pepsi to the half submerged counselor and

990
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,440
 do you decide to help him anyway or refuse to help him?

991
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,120
 Saying you don't think you're liable anyway.

992
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,480
 I'm going to take the lawyers advice.

993
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,520
 I am not a lawyer.

994
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,360
 That was a lawyer that's on a advice.

995
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,880
 We spend some people points on this.

996
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,080
 Let's go with that.

997
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,120
 Your lawyer is currently drinking Pepsi in the jacuzzi though.

998
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,800
 I would know that one.

999
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,840
 It's okay, still a lawyer.

1000
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,840
 Even if submerged.

1001
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:28,280
 Yeah, this one is clearly going for like the sort of feeling to the scenario.

1002
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,080
 Quite like it.

1003
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,480
 You're going to say you're not liable and help him anyway.

1004
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,600
 Is that okay, John?

1005
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,400
 Yeah.

1006
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,000
 You have a following options to find him.

1007
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,640
 It costs one people point apart from option F, which costs two.

1008
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,040
 You know from club that doc realizes people are searching for him and that

1009
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,800
 doc cat doesn't have much money.

1010
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,160
 Choose which options you will take.

1011
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,280
 And I think you can have as many, I think you can have as many here as you want.

1012
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,400
 So you can look at your registration records.

1013
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,120
 Look at the hotel register for the room block.

1014
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,440
 Post a poster with his description.

1015
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,920
 Alert the hotel to the situation.

1016
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,360
 Show Doc's picture at staff headquarters and let all convention personnel.

1017
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,360
 Or assign a person to club to help him search, which costs you two people points.

1018
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,960
 I don't think we should put a poster up.

1019
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,360
 I think that's kind of excessive.

1020
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,560
 Yeah.

1021
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,960
 I think we should check our registration data under the hotel data to see if he's in the thing.

1022
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,200
 And I think we should tell our staff.

1023
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,960
 Do I assign a person to club?

1024
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,000
 Is that a bit much?

1025
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,120
 Oh no.

1026
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,400
 Did we have an option for going to look in the con suite?

1027
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,360
 No you do not.

1028
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,640
 He's probably not got a hotel room.

1029
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,360
 He's got no money.

1030
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,040
 So let's not bother with the hotel room.

1031
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:47,880
 Just is he a member and is he a member and tell our staff to keep an eye out for him?

1032
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,320
 Yeah, that's two.

1033
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:49,640
 All right.

1034
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,400
 That cost you two people points.

1035
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,880
 Roll a D6 twice and add the results.

1036
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,000
 Oh, I'll do one.

1037
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,880
 You do one?

1038
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,200
 Yeah.

1039
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,080
 Six.

1040
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,520
 I get four.

1041
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,120
 So that's 10 in total.

1042
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,600
 Brilliant.

1043
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,000
 And your modifier would have been two.

1044
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,480
 Because you chose two effective options.

1045
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,400
 Just to say that the hotel register,

1046
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,360
 your correct has no effect because he's not using his own name.

1047
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,640
 They can't afford a hotel.

1048
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:21,480
 And the posters lower your score because it tips him off that you're looking for.

1049
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,200
 Mm.

1050
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,480
 Anyway, you rolled a seven or more.

1051
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,960
 So your effort succeed and Dork is found.

1052
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,480
 Gain one goodwill point and one financial point because there was a reward.

1053
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,440
 Oh, one goodwill and one financial.

1054
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,000
 Going up on that goodwill track, we're at six now.

1055
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,760
 And you gain another one goodwill point because Club will write a book on this case,

1056
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,440
 which attracted national attention and he will praise your efforts.

1057
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,600
 Wow.

1058
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,480
 Okay.

1059
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,800
 So we get up to seven goodwill points.

1060
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,000
 Six, five, seven.

1061
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,480
 Wow.

1062
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,120
 Okay.

1063
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:03,880
 Because we basically we narc and that's what you should do, kids.

1064
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,600
 Well, I mean, we're not going to, it's under 13.

1065
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,160
 I mean, I feel like, yeah, there's no way.

1066
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,720
 No, don't.

1067
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,680
 It's fair.

1068
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,440
 You know, if it was like a 17 year old, then I think we'd have a big ethical issue.

1069
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,880
 But for a 12 year old, I think we have to, you have to try and get them back.

1070
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,440
 Yeah.

1071
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:18,440
 Yeah.

1072
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:18,920
 Yeah.

1073
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,480
 Yeah.

1074
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,720
 So I think that is the end of our scenarios for today.

1075
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,120
 I'm just, so I just tell you because they're quite,

1076
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,240
 quite good ones.

1077
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,920
 What happens if you don't do things?

1078
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,720
 Basically, if you don't consult your lawyer and you admit liability,

1079
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,760
 that goes badly.

1080
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,760
 It was right the following out a thousand times.

1081
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,800
 I will never ever admit liability in any circumstances.

1082
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,720
 You can either do that on your own, lose one people point or pay me one financial

1083
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,640
 point as a retainer and I will do it for you.

1084
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,040
 If you're, if you're wrong, he's angry.

1085
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,440
 If you're correct, but you don't consult him, he's like, yeah, you, you have to do

1086
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,080
 the ego.

1087
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:01,080
 And if you, um, in some scenarios, the police arrive and then hotel security,

1088
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,600
 check all your rooms because the kid was sleeping and registered on someone's floor.

1089
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,680
 You can lose a lot of points on that one.

1090
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,360
 So basically we took a very good path through that and we're also a bit lucky.

1091
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,240
 You took a very good path one, but you were a little bit lucky.

1092
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,280
 Yeah.

1093
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,640
 So I think that's the end.

1094
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,480
 So we should add up your total score.

1095
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,840
 So presumably giving helping club would have helped.

1096
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,640
 Would it's giving assigning somebody to club to serve?

1097
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:23,880
 Yeah.

1098
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,240
 You get basically, you spend two people points on it and get two extra points.

1099
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:27,640
 Hmm.

1100
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,440
 Okay.

1101
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:28,680
 Okay.

1102
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,640
 That makes sense.

1103
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,600
 Um, that one actually helps, but you're way over there anyway.

1104
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,920
 You only need seven and you're rolling two de six.

1105
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,080
 So you'd be quite glad to do it if you don't do anything.

1106
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,480
 So to get your final score, start with the number of goodwill points.

1107
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,760
 Seven.

1108
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,160
 Yes.

1109
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,760
 And what your finance, and your financial points are five.

1110
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,640
 Yeah, we can't make him money.

1111
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,200
 Yeah.

1112
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,240
 Divide the, if your financial points are greater than four, divide the excess by two,

1113
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,360
 rounding down and subtract that from the score.

1114
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,360
 So it's not good to make too much money.

1115
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,520
 So the excess is one divided by two is half rounded down to zero.

1116
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,880
 So still seven.

1117
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,360
 Yeah.

1118
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:06,600
 Yeah.

1119
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,080
 Okay.

1120
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:13,880
 So we, we made, so my theory that four was probably about the amount you were okay to make.

1121
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,800
 Of course, in fact, exactly right.

1122
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,320
 And that was not a memory from the eighties.

1123
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,600
 That was just kind of feeling about conventional finance.

1124
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,800
 We can pass that extra along.

1125
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,600
 It's not a problem.

1126
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,720
 And then people points, our people points are positive.

1127
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,000
 So divide them by three, rounding up and add them to the score.

1128
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,360
 Oh, so that is two, because we had six people points.

1129
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,000
 Yeah.

1130
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,280
 Your helpers all had fun.

1131
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,640
 So you get a total of nine points.

1132
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,800
 Hey, that's good, right?

1133
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,440
 I mean, we're not competing with anybody, but that was a good con.

1134
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,160
 Everyone enjoyed the, the work on that John and I ran.

1135
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,680
 I know it was a freedom con.

1136
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,160
 Yeah.

1137
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,520
 You brought as a giant toilet.

1138
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,800
 You didn't lose any children.

1139
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,640
 You didn't cause ruckions by over filling the con suite with food.

1140
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,640
 And I've got an art prompt.

1141
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,680
 So I could do that.

1142
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,360
 Yeah, I think that was quite successful.

1143
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,280
 Just going to be punctuation con the world con.

1144
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,560
 A badder saying that with like a, a giant privy with three of us on it somewhere.

1145
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,760
 Nine points.

1146
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,000
 Okay.

1147
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,280
 So listeners, I guess how do you play through?

1148
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,480
 Hmm.

1149
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,600
 I guess we just have to tell them like what pages to go to.

1150
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,440
 And then they play through and then listen.

1151
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,160
 If they want to try and beat our score, because if they listen,

1152
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,840
 they'll know what the right answers are.

1153
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,360
 So they should play before.

1154
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,040
 Yeah, but you also need a, you need a GM really because it's hard to do it without

1155
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,720
 kind of seeing what the next step is.

1156
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,200
 But no, no, people who've played this game, write in and tell us your experiences.

1157
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,320
 And what was particularly funny about when you played?

1158
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,680
 I mean, I'm going to say, I do think this 2015 update is a fast improvement for me

1159
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,960
 on the previous versions, because yeah, it's a lot more up to date.

1160
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,680
 Yeah, there was a lot of stuff that was very old fashioned.

1161
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,800
 There is still quite a bunch of stuff.

1162
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,320
 I mean, we didn't do it this time, but there is a scenario about like how much effort

1163
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,840
 you should you put into like your software and ask for sweets, which is very American centric,

1164
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,560
 because in the UK, you're going to put much less effort into those, for instance.

1165
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,040
 And there's also, I think, a lot where it's about unionized workforces,

1166
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,920
 which have basically, there's like different implications for having a fully unionized

1167
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,760
 facility in the US and there are in the UK.

1168
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:25,320
 I spent a lot of time flirting with the leader of the bunch of people who were setting up

1169
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,480
 the exhibits hall at Chicon, and that all of that time was very well worth it.

1170
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,400
 I'm not proud.

1171
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,600
 But basically, he was kind of like, you didn't move a sofa, did you?

1172
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,520
 And we were like, oh, oh, I'm so terribly sorry.

1173
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,160
 And, you know, and oh, you guys are lovely.

1174
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,880
 And oh, I really, I can only really move so fast if I have a hefty,

1175
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,720
 a couple of hefty chaps to help.

1176
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,480
 And he kind of went away going, just remember that we'll always come and help you lift

1177
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,160
 sofas rather than, oh, no, let me put this on the list of things that this convention is doing,

1178
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,360
 whether or not supposed to.

1179
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,200
 And I think there's, yeah, I'd not, I'd not be to a convention in a

1180
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,400
 strongly unionized convention center before it was a shot.

1181
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,200
 Yeah.

1182
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,400
 Yes, that's it.

1183
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,080
 But it's just that there are things to consider in the US when you're in a unionized

1184
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,240
 facility that I've not come across in the UK one, like, you know, is there been a problem,

1185
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,000
 you know, moving furniture and plugging stuff in in such a strict way.

1186
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,920
 But that's just the different systems.

1187
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,400
 But that's why it's such a shock to me to see like conventions,

1188
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,640
 advertise that they have a non-union facility.

1189
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,000
 And I'm like, try that.

1190
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,960
 That's a negative thing, which, I mean, think it is.

1191
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,320
 And indeed, union is good.

1192
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:37,400
 We approve of unionized facilities, but we understand that it can be quite difficult for

1193
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,720
 some aspects of conorally.

1194
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,840
 Yeah, basically for your building up your exhibits, all and so on.

1195
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,360
 That was quite fun.

1196
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,840
 We'll put a link for you to buy it in the show notes.

1197
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,480
 And thank you to everyone who has written scenarios or contributed scenarios to this

1198
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,400
 across its four editions.

1199
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:59,640
 Yes, thank you to everyone who has been responsible for the events that caused

1200
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,560
 the scenarios to be written, having carefully pliled off serial numbers.

1201
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,400
 Yes, that is all so fair.

1202
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:12,520
 Yeah, I think your goal, your goal is to never be the inspiration for an if-I-run-the-con scenario.

1203
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,440
 Yeah, that does seem reasonable.

1204
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,080
 Oh yeah, if you're listening here and you've actually been the person in a scenario,

1205
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,920
 to let us know, were you the 12-year-old in the games room?

1206
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,680
 Were you the lady with the snake?

1207
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:33,080
 So that has been a very special episode of What to Thorpe, and it's goodbye from me.

1208
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,600
 It's goodbye from me.

1209
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,880
 And it's goodbye from me.

1210
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:57,000

1212
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,040

 I'm Liz Batty.

 I'm John Coxon.

1215

 And I'm Alison Scott.

1216
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,960
 Yay, okay, we managed.

1217
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,480
 I've uprooted the natural order of things.

1218
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:13,960
 I'm sorry.

1219
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:20,440

1222
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,640
 Beep.

1223
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:32,640
