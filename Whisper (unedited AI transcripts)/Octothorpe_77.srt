00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,140
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 77th episode of Octa Thorpe. This episode is coming

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,120
 to you on the 16th of February 2023 and if you're on the way to the UCU picket line

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:31,120
 solidarity comrades. I'm Jon Coxon, I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and we have some

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,640
 letters of comment. We've got a toot, a tweet and an email. What's the difference between

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,800
 a talk and a talk? I don't know Jon what is the difference between a talk and a talk?

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,000
 It wasn't a joke, I just think we need different acronyms for toot and tweet. A talk and a

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,520
 talk, a toot and a tweet. And we need them toot tweet. Oh dear. That wasn't where I was

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,400
 going with that but staying in the edit. Boom. It's fine. Raj messaged us to let us know

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,760
 that they are going to write a proper lock later but they loved the episode art for number

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,880
 76. That was done by my wife, Ispania. I will pass on your compliments Raj. And it

11
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,280
 was a very good picture of three groundhogs which look suspiciously like us looking at

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,440
 their shadow and I did not get it at all. I did not understand it. I had to look at it

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,560
 several times and eventually ask Jon what it meant and he told me. Oh I also didn't get

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,960
 it till later but why I very cleverly put the title and the alt text in the show notes

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,080
 so that people would read the show notes and be like oh I bold of you to assume that people

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,080
 read the show notes Jon. That is true. It's true. But all of you just assume that I read

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:44,560
 the show notes Jon. Also it provoked Alison to come up with a joke because it is said

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,360
 that if the three of us see our shadows on Groundhog Day it means we'll have to talk

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,200
 about China on the podcast every fortnight until the end of the year. For shadowing. But

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:05,760
 don't fish. We also heard from Hugo Girl. Firstly Hugo Girl mentioned us in their most

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,840
 recent episode or possibly the second to most recent episode depending on when you listen

22
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,400
 to this listeners about weird crisps and Amy and Haley have volunteered to try full haggis

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,040
 so that's exciting. They're like we love some awful and I'm like cool that's good.

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,800
 And also I mentioned to Laurie who does their audio transcripts that we have started doing

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,040
 transcribing with whisper and you can do this as well. I will put a link in the show notes

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,320
 to the GitHub repository that I'm using. They got into a discussion on Twitter about

27
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,600
 this so it's worth noting we're using the C++ port of whisper which means instead of

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,480
 being limited to transcribing it to X speed you can do a full 45 minute episode of Octo

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,400
 Thorpe in like three minutes which is quite useful so I tuned through all of our episodes

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,880
 and now we can like search when we said things like China or Guff which is useful. I've used

31
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,640
 it at least once already but if anyone wants any tips on how to use this software do to

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,040
 me. Sounds rude than tweeting you for some reason. Yeah two me listeners. We'll get used to it.

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,960
 It's like the fart signal. We also heard from Christopher J. Garcia who signed his email

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,200
 Chris who is also apathetic about things having meaning so that was like the best end off

35
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,160
 to an email. Chris says that there is both haggis and vegetarian haggis in a can. We

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:33,160
 Mexicans are not barbarians Chris says we eat our brains and lungs in soup which fair

37
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,360
 he also says I'm wrong because gurps is the one true way. When are you running a gurps

38
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,520
 campaign then Chris get on it. You told me why gurps was rubbish and it was completely

39
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,040
 compelling I totally agreed with you. Yeah you were right I only liked gurps because it

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,200
 was the 80s then. Also it rhymes with burps. I wasn't sure if anyone would have one in

41
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,260
 the tank. Oh I'm glad you did. Always always. Liz must remember not to mess with the time

42
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,320
 screens as the clock is running at both ends. So Liz don't do that. I will not do that.

43
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,120
 Having started burping I can't stop so I may be a while. What have I done? I would like

44
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,800
 to pull out some random quotes from Chris's letter James Mason is basically a beard that

45
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:24,160
 delivers lines from a script. And I'm also creating a museum about things of my life

46
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,000
 Thank you Chris. It should be good. I would go to the Museum of Christopher J. Garcia.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,320
 I've been to Chris's house which I imagine would be similar. I bought tacos. There's

48
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,840
 a good taco place near Chris's house. There used to be good Chinese food near Chris's

49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
 house but firstly that Chinese restaurant went away and secondly he moved and those two

50
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,400
 things conspire to mean that is no longer true but the peanut dumplings were the best

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,800
 Chinese food I ever ate in my entire dang life. I was very tired I was on my tough trip.

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,200
 It was great.

53
00:04:51,200 --> 00:05:02,160
 Shall we discuss Chida because we saw our shadows?

54
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
 Specifically we're discussing Chengdu right we're not discussing the entirety of China.

55
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,600
 That is true we're discussing Chengdu. Did you hear this light note of worry in Liz's

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,520
 voice there that we might somehow get comfortable? We don't have much to talk about China this

57
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:29,440
 week. What we do have is a post by Dave McCarty on Facebook that Liz found.

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,800
 I mean my point is if we're talking about you know if we're talking about like you know

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,640
 the Denver Worldcon we don't say this week we're going to talk about America like it is not a monolith.

60
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,280
 Would you like me to do my joke again?

61
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,960
 But this is my point I don't know it just feels a bit weird to say we're going to talk about China

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,400
 when we know we're not going to talk about a billion people we're going to talk about the

63
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,360
 Worldcon. Yes no fair enough. I will now proceed to tell you about Dave McCarty so rather Dave McCarty

64
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,200
 on Facebook here's the Hugo Administrator for Chengdu and he said they're in the process of testing

65
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,880
 nomination page should be readied by the end of February and given that the dates have moved

66
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,600
 October nominations will stay open through the end of April and then voting on the ballot will

67
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,400
 happen in June so that all sounds well and good. Why is this announced on Dave McCarty's Facebook

68
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,920
 page and not like the Chengdu official Facebook page or any other any other forms? Who knows but

69
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,920
 it is nice to have some of you so thank you Dave. I guess it would have been as accurate to say

70
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,440
 that we were going to discuss Chicago. For those who don't know Dave McCarty lives in Chicago.

71
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,000
 It's not a funny joke even if you know that but it's much less funny if you don't so

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,640
 might go to negative fun. Well done. I'm rocking it this week but yes thank you very much Liz. No

73
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,560
 I mean it is good to know however I agree with everything Liz said. I'm going to snip that out

74
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,480
 and keep that on a soundboard for later. Yep. So yes we should have nominations opening fairly soon.

75
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:07,440
 Fingers crossed. And from that we can seamlessly segue into discussing what we're going to nominate

76
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,440
 for the Hugh Goes. Now this week we're going to mostly focus our best dramatic presentation

77
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,000
 short form on account of how we're all under red crocodiles. Is that fair? It's fair I feel I need

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,520
 to I have a wider selection of you know stuff I have read to think about then I have things that I

79
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,600
 could plausibly nominate in dramatic presentation I think. So yes basically yes. Liz is less

80
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,680
 troggler.ie. It's not less troggler than you. I haven't started my pre-dobulation reading yet but

81
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,920
 I have watched them telling. Thank you Renee and the many volunteers who put stuff in the big spreadsheet

82
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,800
 of things that are eligible for the Hugh Go awards. It's really helpful when it comes to try and

83
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,760
 remember what year anything was released in and how long things were and whether like queering

84
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,720
 whether things are actually eligible or not. So thank you very much. Who wants to go first?

85
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,880
 John pick one and then I'll pick one how about that and we can go round for a lit. A draft!

86
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,040
 A draft! Alright we're going to draft listeners. The way this works is we're all going to pick one

87
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,040
 and we can't pick one that someone else picked and we're going to put the draft picks in the show notes

88
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,120
 at the end. Okay. Ah and I go first. Fuck this is a lot of responsibility. Well I've got to pick

89
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,480
 something that is good because I can save my crap picks for after Liz has gone because she won't

90
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:31,200
 pick any crap because she's Lady of discernment. I've only got like three picks as well so. So do I

91
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,960
 go for what I think is the slam dunk? I'm going to go for one that I think I think this might win

92
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,960
 and I don't know whether I think it should win but I think it's got a very good chance of winning

93
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,000
 and that is Babylon's Ashes from season six of The Expanse which is the finale of that season and

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,760
 is a 2022 work. I think it will be on the ballot even if I don't nominate it and I think it has a

95
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,560
 very high chance of winning this category as the Kappa 2 basically six seasons of Delhi and also I

96
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,000
 think the Expanse has done okay in short form previously but yes I will pick Babylon's Ashes.

97
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,680
 Has it won? Has it the Expanse ever won a Hugo? I think it has but I might be wrong.

98
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,680
 I thought did it not win last year? Nemesis Games won in 2022 and that is the only other

99
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,520
 Oh and Leviathan wakes won in 2017 and those are the other two times the Expanse won in best

100
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:34,640
 dramatic presentation short form. So Leviathan wakes was the first season finale and Nemesis

101
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,240
 Games I think was the fifth season finale. If you give the Hugo I'm getting all philosophical here.

102
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:49,440
 If you give the Hugo for best dramatic presentation short form to the final episode of a six series

103
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,600
 television show are you really giving it to a short form item at all really or are you in fact

104
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,640
 celebrating a long form item? We have neatly encapsulated a debate that has been had for about

105
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,720
 the last decade and a half. The best short form dramatic presentation award has gone to a standalone

106
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:19,200
 short form piece of science fiction twice. Oh when? Gollum's acceptance speech at the 2003 MTV

107
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,840
 Movies Awards and Dr Horrible's single long blog. Okay that's not a strong argument for giving the

108
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,680
 Hugo to standalone short forms. The Gollum's acceptance speech was quite clever. I think the

109
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,040
 thing is that in practice short form has never been about short form science fiction it's always

110
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,640
 been about TV. I mean and I think like it depends right because we have seen TV win in long form

111
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,120
 and that will come up again as a discussion later and like I do think all of the things that have

112
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,200
 one in short form have been astounding standalone pieces but like it's real tricky because they're

113
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,400
 part of longer works but we award novels that are part of series all the time so I don't know.

114
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,640
 I think this could be a future episode. Yep yep. But I think yeah Babylon's Ashes is my first pick.

115
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,480
 Yeah I feel like there should be a place to reward good episodes of TV. If you don't think

116
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
 Babylon's Ashes is particularly good but you like the last season they're expanding too much to

117
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,240
 put it in long form. I think working against it might be that you know the Expanse finished

118
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:26,640
 very early in 2022 it is a long time kind of outside out of mind there so that might work against it.

119
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,880
 True, true, true. My first pick is it's going to be an episode of Andor. I'm just deciding which one

120
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,800
 I might pick as my top one. And this is interesting because one of the things I thought was quite good

121
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,000
 about Andor was that it did manage to do some distinct episodes while being serialised.

122
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:55,360
 I would probably pick one way out from Andor as my top pick which if you have seen it is basically

123
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,280
 the one with the prison break and a succession of great monologues. So that would probably be my

124
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,960
 first pick there. So that's the prison break episode with Gollum's acceptance speech in it.

125
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:18,800
 See what you did there. Yes. So Andy Serkis is extraordinarily fantastic in that episode as far as

126
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,720
 I know he is not wearing a motion capture suit. No so I would have picked one way out as my first

127
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,120
 pick except that I knew Liz would pick it so I was like but yes I think it is. So one way out is

128
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,840
 amazing it is one of a series of sort of amazing standout episodes of Andor and I think it would

129
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,120
 be a worthy winner. Yeah no I also think that I think it's probably my favourite single episode

130
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:51,280
 of Andor and yeah. So my first pick is going to be the final episode of Severance and you guys are

131
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,840
 going to have to tell me what it's called because I'm not doing any heavy lifting

132
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,280
 ass at this episode. Somehow disconnected from Wikipedia.

133
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,080
 I still have disconnected from reality in a big way. It's called The Way We Are. The Way We Are.

134
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,160
 So it's quite hard to talk about the last episode of Severance without spoiling it which I'm not

135
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,000
 going to do but what happens in the last episode is that the various things, well I suppose always

136
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,760
 happens in the last episode of series but the various things that have been happening come

137
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,440
 together in a really spectacular way which is not like anything I've seen done in television before

138
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:37,600
 and is both very entertaining and very thought-provoking and just generally wonderful and it's a brilliant

139
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,440
 piece of television. Definitely the best piece of television short form I watched in 2022 and yes

140
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,720
 it was the final episode of an extremely tight series so we'll get back to that in long form.

141
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,520
 Yes so it is I mean obviously very good, directed by Ben Stiller and I find Severance, one of the

142
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,800
 reasons I find Severance very interesting is that I think that if you look at Ben Stiller's career as

143
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,400
 like what he's done outside of acting he's clearly had an interest in science fiction for a very

144
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:10,160
 long time but he's also had an interest in very weird science fiction so like he was the person

145
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,440
 who gave Rob Shrub and Dan Harmon money to do Heat Vision and Jack which was a TV series about Jack

146
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,040
 Black and a talking motorcycle and so Stiller's obviously had like a slum or offbeat sense of SF

147
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,760
 nor humor for a while and Severance seems to be like a very good vehicle for that and so yeah I

148
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,360
 have enjoyed Severance greatly and again we will come back to that later. But also you say humer,

149
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,200
 Severance is a very funny show but it's also an extremely unsettling and scary show in lots of

150
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,600
 ways it's doing a lot, a lot of different, a lot of different things going on there.

151
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,120
 I think humor can often be very unsettling. Well when you do it,

152
00:14:47,120 --> 00:15:02,240
 that my second pick therefore is going to be I am going to go with Defiant Jazz. Defiant Jazz,

153
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,920
 it's a bit boring because we just talked about Severance but I will pick Defiant Jazz

154
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,800
 because it's the best episode of Severance and I loved it. Just great. Just the very episode title

155
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,920
 sums up everything I love about Severance so much so yes I'm going to pick Defiant Jazz and I guess

156
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,240
 I might be the one I nominate if I only nominate one it might be that one instead of the way we are

157
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:32,080
 but it's the one with the music dance experience which is very good. So I get to pick a mix I think.

158
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,960
 So again it's quite sometimes quite difficult to pick a particular episode so basically I am

159
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,960
 trying to pick one episode of what I think was a bit of an up and down season but I think I might

160
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,480
 pick here or trust nothing from Star Trek Lower Decks which is the one where they go to Deep Space

161
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,320
 Nine and it's lots of fun. Yep that is entirely legit. I mean there's really no really not a great

162
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,680
 deal else to say which is it's loads of fun and it uses the Deep Space Nine characters well and

163
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,040
 it's nice to see them again and they're in Garden Form and it's just fun. It would either be that one

164
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,960
 or the one which is called the Mathematically Perfect Redemption which is the evil robot

165
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:18,480
 peanut hamper. That is bloody great. Which is also a solid one so I might in fact go for that

166
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,480
 instead but I did it but it would probably be one of those will be on my ballot I think. Okay I will

167
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,680
 take the Liberty Liz of putting both of those in the giant Hugo Spreadsheet because I don't see them.

168
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,880
 No I don't know they are in there so yes go for it. And they probably ought to be because they are

169
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,760
 both solid solid picks and I think this kind of I don't know I think comedy and animation are both

170
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:51,200
 parts of the genre that are treated less well than their cousins so I do think it's good to

171
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,880
 recognize them. I mean there's also an aspect of gaming what I think will be on the ballot in a way

172
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,680
 and I do think that Lower Decks having been on there before has a good chance of being back on.

173
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,800
 I mean to be honest I'm not sure I've seen anything obscure enough that it's not going to have a

174
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,080
 lot of support from other other areas but it's true there are a lot of Star Trek episodes in the

175
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,400
 Spreadsheet right now but not the ones from Lower Decks so we'll put those in. I think that episode

176
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,000
 would have landed much better for me how do I see Deep Space Nine? I loved it anyway but I really

177
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,360
 wish I had seen Deep Space Nine before. Yeah if I had one criticism of Star Trek Lower Decks it's

178
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,120
 the way it shows up my inadequacy as a Star Trek watcher generally. I'm just too much of a

179
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,240
 dilatante to really get the most out of the series. So then it is over to Alison. I am riffing off

180
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,880
 the Spreadsheet but I think I'm picking something that's not actually on it which is the Christmas

181
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:50,880
 special of ghosts called It's Behind You because I am a terrible hugo nominator and I think that

182
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,520
 ghosts is a great series that really ought to get more science fiction love for what it's doing

183
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,760
 for what it's doing in fantasy and and the space and again comedy I like comedy I want to see more

184
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,760
 comedy on the short form ballot because I think that comedy is something that science fiction

185
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,600
 tends to do quite a lot better in short form than it does in long form. I'm not sure I've heard

186
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,440
 of ghosts. It's a TV series about a couple who buy a house that's sorted. Oh yeah you have it's

187
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,160
 done by the horrible histories people. Is it? I should probably say that. Yeah have you not

188
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,560
 have you enough familiar with ghosts at all and then it's been remade for America with quite a lot

189
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,200
 of the funniest jokes taken out. I think the thing is you haven't mentioned it on the pod.

190
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,280
 Ghosts? Whatever. Nope. I don't think so. Okay right. I don't remember but Don can in fact

191
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,360
 transcripts. Oh he can. Is it good? Should I watch it? Well watch it to see if you think it's funny.

192
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,240
 It's about a couple who inherit an ancient house and they discover that it's inhabited by a load

193
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,320
 of ghosts who are the horrible histories team and they're and all the ghosts are very funny because

194
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:59,840
 they've all died in in terrible horrible histories type gruesome deaths at which you gradually

195
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,800
 discover you to gradually discover what it is that's causing them to haunt this mansion and

196
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,560
 one of the couple can see the ghosts and interact with them and the other one can't and and humor

197
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,240
 happens. It's just a funny show. It's just a funny entertaining show that's been running for I guess

198
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,680
 three and a half seasons but slot was beginning. Watch the first few if you don't like it stop.

199
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,520
 I will also say I feel like I would have remembered you mentioning it because having just read the

200
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:31,040
 cast I am excited. It has Lolly Adafrope and it has Katie Wicks as main cast and it has

201
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,880
 Jeff McGivin, Jessica Knappett and Bridget Christie's recurring cast and I'm like I am here for these

202
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,040
 people so yes I will look this up. Thank you and because it's British there's only like 24 episodes.

203
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,720
 Yeah it's not going to take you long. Hey oh shoot it's background to me. What is Liz going to pick next

204
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:57,040
 and can I snipe it? Probably not. Oh hello interesting. Now why does Liz think I can't snipe it?

205
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,880
 I'm going to pick a Strange New World episode and then the question is which Strange New Worlds

206
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,680
 episode do I pick? It's tricky. There are a lot of good ones. We have been recently watching Strange

207
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,720
 New Worlds by which I mean we have watched the first eight episodes in the space of our week

208
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,280
 and have been enjoying it quite a lot. I'm going to pick Spock and Muk. I think probably it's supposed

209
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,120
 to be pronounced Spock and Muk for the rhyme but I usually pronounce him mukkamuk so um but

210
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,840
 basically it's great. It's just hijinks. Hijinks in space in all the ways that discovery doesn't let

211
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,760
 itself be silly anywhere near often enough. Spock and Muk really embraces the silly side of Star Trek

212
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,880
 and I bloody loved it. So yeah I'll pick that one and also Nurse Chappell is the best and I love her

213
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,160
 very much. So don't you you're correct that that does not snipe me on account of your past pick is

214
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,400
 falls into the genre of things I cannot legally watch because they're not available anywhere.

215
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,920
 I think ghosts might also fall into that. Oh I thought you'd watch Strange New Worlds. No

216
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,480
 Paramount Plus limited limited market so far. Haven't bothered rolling out to kind of watch it

217
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,160
 so yep I haven't seen that at all. Okay so I'll have to go with something else. So I am going to go

218
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,480
 with some more comedy because I'm going to go with what we do in the shadows episode go flip

219
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,080
 yourself. I don't know there's a episode in season four I felt were a little bit uneven and some of

220
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,600
 them have great moments but also some less great stuff going on but Go Flip yourself is done like

221
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,960
 in the style of a sort of home renovation show. So basically Laslo the vampire has been obsessed

222
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,160
 with a home renovation show and he thinks he has got the home renovation show in to come and renovate

223
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,320
 their mansion and so the first put is done as though you know you are watching the home renovation

224
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,160
 show where all the crew are getting killed kind of you know behind the scenes and so on but it all

225
00:21:52,160 --> 00:22:00,160
 turns out that it is more of a plot to bring back in a character from previous seasons which is very

226
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,560
 funny because they just ran the whole character incredibly funny and so that's probably my pick

227
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,320
 of the fourth season which aired in 2022. I have not seen I could not have picked that because I

228
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,080
 have not seen well I've not seen what we do in the shadows. Yeah I figured you hadn't so you

229
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,320
 wouldn't pick it so I was pretty confident you weren't going to snipe me you probably should

230
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,920
 watch it though it's good. I watched I watched the movie and I loved the movie and I watched the

231
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,920
 first episode of the TV show and I was like this is not as good as the movie and then I didn't watch

232
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,000
 anymore but I have heard from many people that it gets better so maybe I should give it another

233
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,320
 try. I was really like I'm not going to watch it because the movie was so good this all just

234
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,320
 be rubbish and then it's got Matt Berry in so I do love Matt Berry yes I can hear you Clem Fandango

235
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:51,440
 as Panya has that on a mug. Right Alison your next pick. Right my next pick for best dramatic

236
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,880
 presentation is short form is the first episode of season three of Mythic Quest across the universe.

237
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
 We left the Mythic Quest people at the end of season two really scattered to the four wins and

238
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,080
 and they're not all doing the same thing anymore and they're not all working on Mythic Quest anymore

239
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
 and they've gone off doing all sorts of different things so they had to find a way to bring them

240
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
 all together at the beginning of season three because this is basically an ensemble cast it's a

241
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,240
 comedy about an ensemble cast and they did it very well and they did it in a way that was quite

242
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,240
 science fictional actually. I mean I know it's technically is it genre it's a it's kind of

243
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,160
 quite close to genre is Mythic Quest it's a comedy show about a bunch of people who make video games

244
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:39,440
 so you know one of whom has been a science fiction writer before writing for video games.

245
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,600
 And it's a good episode I really really enjoyed it and I was kind of like sitting down going

246
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,480
 oh don't know how Mythic Quest is gonna cope now it's all gonna be bad and then at the end of the

247
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,560
 episode I was like oh no it's gonna be great it's gonna be fantastic so I loved it there are some

248
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,000
 spoilers which I'm not going to again not spoil if you haven't seen Mythic Quest it's good it's on

249
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,920
 Apple TV so a lot of people haven't seen it um in general you know you want to get Apple TV plus

250
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,040
 to watch Severance and then you should watch Mythic Quest as well and then there's a few other

251
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,360
 things you should watch I probably watch for all my kind haven't watched it yet but you should do

252
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,880
 and I will do but haven't yet um there may be a reason why I've been watching a lot of comedy

253
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,120
 so far I think all my short form nominations may be comedy apart from if I short form

254
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,560
 nominate Severance which I'm not intending to do because I'm planning to love form nominated

255
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,960
 anyway spoilers for shadowing so I have a question for you with that foreshadowing which is if you

256
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,440
 have a spot left on your short form will you still not um nominate Severance or will you be like

257
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,800
 or nominate the best episode two cracks of the apple I don't know what happens doesn't it all get

258
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:50,960
 transferred and discounted um Liz Bat I was gonna say I don't actually know because like you can't

259
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,840
 you can't end up giving yourself six nominations in best short form by transferring everything from

260
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,800
 best long form or vice versa I don't think but I think if you left a space if I give you put

261
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,440
 long let's say you put an episode of Severance in best short form but you haven't filled up best

262
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,960
 long form I think it will get transferred so I think I think like they won't if you've nominated

263
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,360
 it in both they won't they will treat that as a nomination in both because it's very clear what

264
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,240
 your intention is but if you've nominated it in short form and then long form like two nominations

265
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,000
 off I don't know whether they'd get transferred if they weren't enough to get on the final ballot

266
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,040
 yeah I think it's quite possible then that my short form ballot will include what I think is the best

267
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,360
 episode of each of Andor and Severance which we've already talked about but we've already talked

268
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,080
 about both of them in fact so we've each got two picks left I haven't seen Star Trek Discovery

269
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,040
 season four so I can't nominate from that I haven't seen the Sandman and I haven't seen I haven't seen

270
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,960
 the latest season of the of For All Mankind sorry and I know what I want to basically is between

271
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,880
 three and the next one I'm going to pick is Asylum from Moon Knight now not everyone loved Moon

272
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,040
 Knight but that is because not everyone was correct because Moon Knight was amazing

273
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,600
 it was my favorite empty-youth thing basically I've always had a soft spot for Moon Knight and

274
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,520
 seeing them actually fucking do it in all its weird glory on a big screen with Oscar Isaac was

275
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,480
 just like what's going on it was amazing I can't can't adequately state how amazing it was to see

276
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,640
 like something I love that much like done so so seriously I'm not no seriously because it had

277
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,080
 jokes in as well but like it wasn't ironic I think it would have been very easily easy to do it

278
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,440
 ironically and they didn't and I respected that a great deal Asylum is I think the best episode

279
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,200
 but I loved all of them very very much and as I put it to my friend Ian when I guest start on

280
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,040
 become the teapot imagine that they'd made an iron fist tv show and imagine how good that would

281
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,880
 feel Ian because you love iron fist and imagine imagine when or if they ever make an iron fist tv

282
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:02,400
 show how good that will feel and for some reason he seems sad that's my pick yeah I mean I think

283
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,360
 I like I like Moon Knight less than you which is not difficult I mean I basically thought it was

284
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,280
 pretty great whenever it was doing stuff with Oscar Isaac but a lot of the stuff that wasn't Oscar

285
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,000
 Isaac less good I like Ethan Hawke a lot as well I liked him I thought there was some interesting

286
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,600
 things but he didn't I don't know I didn't feel he got a ton of great stuff but just basically

287
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,360
 Oscar Isaac was so good at portraying the different aspects of Moon Knight that I really enjoyed that

288
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,320
 bit so I think you're right thinking about that that is the best episode yeah it's probably a solid

289
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,160
 pick if you're gonna pick anything we have not picked a lot of stuff from Marvel haven't we

290
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,080
 no I mean I think they had a week year but like I don't think I'm gonna put any particular

291
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,040
 episode of like spoilers Ms Marvel or She Hulk on there because they just did not quite reach the

292
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,200
 top of my I don't think I'll nominate anything for She Hulk I do think I was dithering so like

293
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,400
 spoilers for my final pick I was dithering between the partition episode of Ms Marvel which I do

294
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:07,440
 think was really good TV like even though I don't think Ms Marvel as a longer piece was amazing

295
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,720
 that episode was pretty damn good but I am going for a different one I might go well we'll see

296
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:22,240
 you can leave them to Spence it's Liz's pick it is my pick I was thinking what to pick I mean

297
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,800
 it's possible that I will end up with multiple episodes of Andor on there it's possible I also

298
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:36,320
 haven't watched Station 11 which is supposed to be great yeah I haven't seen that either but I think

299
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,120
 it is quite possible that I will end putting an episode of For All Mankind on there the problem

300
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,960
 is that in season two the episode that got nominated was like absolutely this season was not the

301
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,040
 season was not always great and then the last episode pulled it all together and then I think

302
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,840
 series three well not quite as good but I guess it would probably be if I nominate anything it would

303
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,880
 probably be Stranger in a Strange Land which is the final episode of the season again because it

304
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,560
 pulled some stuff nicely together and set up some interesting stuff for the last series and

305
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:16,880
 yeah when they basically the resolution of Margot's plotline in that sets up some really

306
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,440
 interesting stuff and I thought she was really great so I would go with that one Margot is

307
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:30,160
 amazing I haven't seen season three season four season three but Margot is just so great and I

308
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,320
 love the way I mean I don't know whether this holds season three but in season one and season two I

309
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,200
 love that both seasons start with Margot in exactly the same way but in different circumstances

310
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,320
 I thought I was a really nice touch I am looking forward to seeing that season of For All Mankind

311
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,120
 but we were busy watching literally all the other TV there's so much TV

312
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,360
 it's like I can yeah I mean I'm not sure I agree in you know you you have to kind of

313
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,240
 believe that maybe Margot was a little bit more naive than you actually think Margot as a character

314
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,520
 is to I'm trying very hard to do this without giving a big massive honking spoiler but like she

315
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,160
 is a little bit naive to not see what's going on but you kind of believe that she thought it would

316
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:20,720
 all work out okay right and then doesn't work out as okay as you would like I'm gonna be so sad at

317
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,840
 the end okay for our life yeah I was thought I'm gonna say then John can go and be sad and send

318
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 me messages about how sad he is when he gets to that point I do do that every time I'm sad I send

319
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,960
 Liz like infinite texts Liz I'm sad I should do that maybe I should start doing that Liz is

320
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,400
 give me a look you find John but just don't just don't get sad anytime after about like 5 p.m

321
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:47,680
 because I'll be asleep so that is your problem there and he gets sad during specific times

322
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,920
 you can send me infinite texts say you're sad after 5 p.m we could kind of type sub-time share

323
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,840
 arrangement and I in return will send back bad jokes how the turns table it's true I won't send

324
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,760
 you bad jokes that is Alison's domain no it's John's domain hands off my domain we're not when he's

325
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,200
 when he's sad he cannot be a joke creation machine that's the thing Alison is your pick

326
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,880
 when we have five picks each that's really a huge number because of course we're not repeating

327
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,200
 each other's picks we're a reality we are a tightly honed automaton who will absolutely

328
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,880
 replicate other each other's picks in the actual ballot so I'm really starting to think for things

329
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,560
 that definitely won't be all the ballots my pick is going to be Harry Josephine Giles reading of

330
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,520
 Deep Wheel L'Ocadia at the Edinburgh Book Festival which I found very interesting and very affecting

331
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:44,640
 and I loved hearing her perform the poem or parts of the poem obviously she didn't perform the entire

332
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,400
 thing and therefore I was very excited to see how it ended I haven't actually read the entire

333
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,240
 novel yet okay so I don't think anyone agrees with me on this and it's not going to be on the ballot

334
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,240
 the genre as a whole does not agree that this should be on the Hugo ballot in that it has not yet

335
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:09,600
 been on the Hugo ballot however I think is that only show or perhaps one of two shows that I can

336
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,720
 think of that is directly trying to talk about the current state of politics in America and talking

337
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,320
 about Trumpism and talking about the Republican Party and the way that corporations are distorting

338
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,480
 American freedom and that is the boys I think like for all its faults and I know that lots of

339
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,760
 people have problems with it it's extremely graphic and it's extremely colorful but it's also not

340
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,160
 trying away from actually talking about this stuff in a way that I don't really think anything else

341
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:46,320
 is doing and so I am going to pick Herogasm in the latest series of the boys which is just

342
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:56,080
 horrific episode it's the episode where it becomes clear the depth to which some people will sink to

343
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,320
 do what they think is right it's an episode which highlights all of the excesses of power and wealth

344
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:10,080
 it's an episode that highlights how those excesses end up ruining lives and I loved it I think it

345
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,640
 was amazing I mean I was a big fan of supernatural before kripkey left so I've always been a fan of

346
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,320
 Eric Kripkey stuff but the boys is like so so much better that supernatural but it's not funny

347
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,480
 and in some ways supernatural is the love letter to America where the boys is the savage criticism

348
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,840
 of America like a supernatural is a celebration of everything that kripkey loves about america and

349
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,680
 american history whereas the boys is the utter pelereing of all of the huge problems in modern

350
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,280
 american culture so yeah that would be my fifth pick I thought the boys have been nominated actually

351
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,720
 has it I did a control F for the boys on the dramatic presentation it hasn't but I'm surprised

352
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,480
 because I thought it had um no I think it and I really think it should have been because like

353
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,640
 even though I know not everyone gets along with it I don't know I just I feel like it is doing

354
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,280
 stuff that nothing else is doing even if you don't like how it's doing it I mean I've only watched

355
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:12,080
 season one so that's why I'm not gonna snipe you I mean I don't have a particular I mean I don't

356
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,000
 have a particular issue with it I didn't really I really didn't get along with the comics at all

357
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,880
 but I thought the the comics are terrible yeah that's why it took me so long to pick it up because

358
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:27,120
 the comics that I read I really didn't like at all and so that was why I was a bit like okay yeah

359
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:34,000
 the the comics are edgelordy nonsense in my opinion I think the comics are trying to talk about the

360
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,280
 same stuff but do such a bad job and also they're they're much more the comics are much more trying

361
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,920
 to talk about 9/11 but they're just not very good whereas the it's a really good example of a show

362
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:52,080
 taking the fundamental it's a bit like the kickass movie the first one it's it's it's a work taking

363
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,120
 the fundamental idea behind a comic and then like actually making something much better out of it

364
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,440
 than the comic managed and I think there is it's not a coincidence that both the examples I've given

365
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,840
 are very edgelordy comics that were less edgeldy in their adaptations because I loved Preacher

366
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:15,120
 but even that had like bits where you were a bit like really yeah I mean I was face basically

367
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:22,160
 yep yeah okay I am not yeah I mean it is ultra violent but I'm not I wouldn't be surprised if I

368
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,120
 did see it on the ballot but I wonder also if it had its heyday kind of in series one and series

369
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,400
 two especially I heard good things about but then maybe not so much season three series two is really

370
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,840
 good series two is really interesting because there is a do you mind spoilers either you're gonna

371
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,240
 watch the boys I can't imagine it'll be Allison's cup of tea at all it's probably a bit violent for

372
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,520
 me I mean I am but I know that I know that like there's a particular character in it if that's

373
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,000
 what you're gonna smile I was gonna talk about Stormfront yeah I have not managed to avoid knowing

374
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,120
 that so yeah and like I like how it's the only safe it's the only science fiction show on tv that

375
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,240
 openly says that the modern republic party has Nazis in it and no one else is doing that and I

376
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,240
 do think saying that out loud in fiction is probably good and I think it's something that the genre

377
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,440
 is shying away from which understandably so or no not a shying away from that's unfair but I think

378
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,160
 the boys is one of the only things that's like obviously enough about what we're living through

379
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,440
 that it can make statements like that which can't be misread if that makes sense and that's why

380
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,160
 everyone who liked Homelander from season one got really angry with later seasons I mean like

381
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,680
 Tom Landers no but there were people who were like Homelander's great right and then it's like

382
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,840
 no he's not oh why do you think that I mean they're watching the same tv show right where you're

383
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:49,600
 basically oh yeah oh yeah that's kind of why I think it's useful to have a character is like oh

384
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,800
 here's a character and then two seasons they should be like no he's evil how do you not get it

385
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,800
 his performance is so creepy that every time he's on screen with a baby you start worrying yes he's

386
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,600
 so good the actor is so good like either the actor is literally evil or the actor is a very good actor

387
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,280
 and I'm not ruling out either but like oh my god that portrayal was amazing he's so unsettling

388
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:22,160
 yeah anyway okay yeah so okay that's my pick Liz last pick last pick oh yeah I'm trying to think

389
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:29,600
 do I have any like totally left feel exciting picks and I don't think I do so I mean I think it

390
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:35,200
 probably is it might be just looking at the spreadsheet I mean things that I've they're on there that I

391
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,000
 think were pretty good and would consider nominating is slightly surprisingly I probably would nominate

392
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,360
 the episode of Stranger Things that is on there because no strange things was quite surprising to me

393
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,560
 in that I looked at series four and you know I was a bit like you know it's been going a while

394
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:01,200
 they keep getting episodes keep getting longer and longer they've basically got a kind of entire

395
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,000
 plot strand that really should be kind of done away with because they don't know what to do with

396
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,360
 the characters but they don't really want to do that so they just keep them off doing an entirely

397
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:17,760
 separate thing and I get bored with it so it's got lots of flaws but the episode which is nominated

398
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:26,880
 which gets Kate Bush back to the top of the charts is pretty good so I can't listen to Kate Bush

399
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,920
 because she gives me flashbacks to first year revision because I had a friend who basically just

400
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:39,120
 played Kate Bush songs and rocked for a solid two months and I have severe Kate Bush based PTSD

401
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,800
 so I've been sitting here for the last five minutes going what can I do for my last pick what can I

402
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,120
 do for my last pick oh what can I do for my last pick oh oh wait I know I haven't watched any of

403
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,480
 Stranger Things since season one because I thought it was a bit pants but but Kate Bush there's an

404
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,640
 episode that's got Kate Bush in I can do is my last pick the one with Kate Kate Bush in because

405
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,920
 because Kate Bush could do no wrong and running up that hill is my favorite Kate Bush song so

406
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,560
 the notion that it basically reinvigorated brought her music to an entire generation who had never

407
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,480
 heard any of it and and she's been completely revitalized that makes it a perfect spot for my

408
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,560
 fifth pick what I love about this is that you have somehow managed to you have somehow managed to

409
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,400
 sign each other on pick five not on pick like one or two five you both waited to the very end and

410
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,640
 then it got personal totally yeah but can't have seen it yeah that's why I don't feel guilty about

411
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,600
 taking the pick from you because you have not seen it but I feel very aggrieved to be

412
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,680
 to be sniped on pick five that was really shocking Kate Bush is in multiple episodes so you could

413
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,840
 just have one of the other ones that has the Kate Bush song in because you won't understand the

414
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,920
 emotional resonance of the Kate Bush song because you haven't seen the episode no I understand the

415
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,280
 emotional resonance of the Kate Bush song because I understand Kate Bush because I listened to it

416
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,400
 when it was new and it's really good in the but you don't understand the context of the show why

417
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,760
 the Kate Bush song is so good no I think basically the show has fundamentally jumped the shark and

418
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,920
 decided that the way it's going to get emotional relevance is by stealing us a piece of music that's

419
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,040
 far better than anything in the show you probably don't want to give it a hugo then do you oh I

420
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,000
 definitely don't want to guess as you go look right I think I speak for all three of us when I say

421
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,760
 that using music to elicit emotional responses in dramatic presentations is wrong and any show that

422
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,200
 does it should not be on the ballot I want entirely silent except for dialogue it's about the ideas

423
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,960
 people it's not about the feelings hashtag proper science fiction fan don't want to be nominating

424
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,040
 the wire if it was more science fictional then I've never seen the wire it does not seem like it

425
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,960
 would be my cup of tea so it famously has only music that occurs during the during the show there

426
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,080
 is no instrumental music oh interesting it is Alison's pick and she's gonna pick Kate Bush's

427
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:12,480
 discography yes and my last pick is all the other episodes of severance pick one any of them I

428
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,960
 think that is really like I think that is very very fair because severance was great that is

429
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,800
 what I'm going to do if I run out of that's what I'm going to do if I run out of nomination slots

430
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:29,440
 um okay so that was our picks shall we do picks I'm going to pick the Arthur C. Clark award

431
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,720
 shortlist from 2022 I read them listeners I read them and I am glad I read them do you have

432
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,880
 opinions John I have some opinions some more disclosure I did not finish reading a river called

433
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:50,000
 time I'm sure it was very good but I think it's got some interesting ideas in it that are perhaps

434
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,320
 ideas that would have been better explored by someone who was better versed in the genre and also

435
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:03,200
 I think the author says that they have decolonized their writing which I think is very admirable but

436
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,840
 all of the female characters exist to be there for the man I like I like books that have women

437
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:15,520
 and who are not just there for the men so that was that I also read Skyward in by Alia Whiteley

438
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,720
 which again I did not like I am not familiar with the Daphne de Morier book which it is in

439
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,720
 conversation with and it may be that if I have read that I would have liked it a lot more I

440
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,360
 thought the science fiction idea was interesting but I thought the characters were not people I

441
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,920
 wanted to spend time with and I think it would be much better as a novelt where they properly

442
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,320
 explored the science fiction concept because basically the first two thirds of the book

443
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,480
 build up to the last third where all the science fiction happens but because I fundamentally

444
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,320
 didn't care about the characters the last third is also like emotional payoff for the characters

445
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,120
 and I'm like but I don't care about them so this just feels very flat so it's a rare

446
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,440
 comment from me that I think it'd been better had a bit less character driven

447
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,560
 which is unusual but there we are I loved Vergen and I loved a desolation called Peace

448
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,800
 we've discussed a desolation called Peace on the podcast before but it is very good

449
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,360
 Vergen the alien love war is amazing it's a very good way of making you think oh no humans are

450
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:17,200
 the worst which was very fun and I liked the way it does that plow it and the sun was good

451
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,000
 again from the literary fiction angle but I enjoyed it I didn't enjoy it as much the other two that

452
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,280
 I mentioned but I did think it was quite good and then Deep Will Arcadia is very conflicting

453
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,200
 because it is a poem or as it refers to itself in the blurb a verse novel and it is clearly a

454
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,240
 work of genius and it is clearly incredible however I found the experience of actually reading it

455
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,760
 was difficult because I have ADHD and because you have to keep switching between the poem and

456
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,680
 the translation if you don't speak the Orkney language which I don't I found the actual experience

457
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,680
 of reading it was very difficult to get into and so I have no idea how to talk about it like

458
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,920
 clearly a work of genius but approach it more like you're in an art museum than you're settling

459
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,720
 in for a nice novel I think but it was very good but I didn't like reading it but it was very good

460
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,400
 I think it's a prose poem that probably repays study rather than a rollicking good read

461
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,000
 would be my guess but it was very good to listen to with it because of course you're listening to

462
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,360
 it being spoken in or cadian but with English translations at the bottom of the screen and that

463
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:30,080
 did help a whole lot I think it in some ways reminds me a lot of reading Shakespeare as a kid

464
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,360
 which is I found reading Shakespeare fine but watching Shakespeare is a lot better and in some

465
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,760
 ways it reminds me of reading the script like to good omens or something where like we're probably

466
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,600
 just script book and it's like why would I read a script book or I'd like to read the thing that

467
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:49,920
 originated from the script and not the script itself and so I do wonder whether as with many poems

468
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,320
 it works better as performance than it's writing John do you want to make joker's guide script book

469
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,080
 yeah but that's mostly because the stage directions are funny

470
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,080
 excellent pursued by a bear yeah Shakespeare occasionally has funny ones but John did you

471
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,520
 enjoy your six stealth picks there or rather three picks and two anti picks I think or three

472
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:16,080
 anti picks yeah yes well I'd buy a whistle to throw it yes you did whistle through it um but yeah

473
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,280
 for anyone else who hasn't read vergan highly recommend buying it and reading it is extremely

474
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,600
 good and I think it was much less talked about than many of the other books on the clerk's short

475
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,400
 list so I highly recommend giving it a look if I if I had to have one pick it would be that one

476
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:37,520
 Liz I am going to pick the most recent issue of Strange Horizons which is one of the criticism

477
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:45,360
 specials they did one in 2022 and they've brought out this one in 2023 it is also a tribute to the

478
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:53,680
 late reviews editor there Maureen Kincaid Speller and so basically it's got a few tributes to Maureen

479
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:00,560
 along with basically criticism that she would have liked to see and so it's got a great essay

480
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:07,280
 from friend of the podcast Neil Arison about his concept of overshoot novels which you must go

481
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,440
 and read the essays so you can find that one overshoot novel is and then completely misuse that term

482
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:20,640
 as a critical term forever yup it's got a good essay or essay I enjoyed on Becky Chambers Wayfarer's

483
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,440
 books which I think gets to some of my issues with their Wayfarer's books and even John enjoyed

484
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,440
 the essay even though he likes the books more than me so good because I think it's very I mean

485
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,760
 it's not a like a hatchet job I think it's not it's not doesn't end up being particularly positive

486
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:44,160
 about the novels but it really digs into kind of why why they are popular but why they why why the

487
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:51,120
 the author of the essay kind of feels they maybe fail to do what he would you would hope this kind

488
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:58,080
 of fiction can do that fair yeah like and the author convinced me of their opinion which is I

489
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:04,800
 think the hallmark of great critical writing in that they argue I think very well that the Wayfarer

490
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:14,800
 series is an expression of sort of current American liberalism and are not really sort of doing anything

491
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,480
 that can further us towards progression because they're reflective and not predictive and not

492
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,240
 trying to move towards a better state and in that way because of the way they're written it

493
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:33,600
 basically portrays current American liberalism as the ideal and I think and I think he really neatly

494
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,200
 hits the nail on the head why I'd really dislike the second novel because he's like this is an

495
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,040
 expression of the American dream and I read it and I thought this is wank and I really don't like

496
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,280
 novel number two I thought no one of three was confusing I love novel number one and I quite

497
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,520
 like novel number four but novel number two I really didn't like and I think putting it in that

498
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,480
 framework helped me understand why and I did I loved that essay I thought it was amazing I think

499
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,200
 yeah great critical writing does two things firstly it can convince you of the author's point of view

500
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,680
 and secondly it can make you think oh so that's why I think that and I think the second one is

501
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,240
 actually in some ways like the holy grail right like if you can identify a thought in the reader's

502
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,880
 head that they have not previously been able to articulate and render them able to articulate it

503
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,320
 that is a very good it was just it was very good even though it is incredibly negative about something

504
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:25,200
 that I do enjoy part of yeah I think ironically John has just expressed much better why I enjoyed

505
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,320
 the essay by picking out the things that I would have said about it so thank you John sorry Liz

506
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:37,200
 in a good way yeah Neil Neil's essay on overshoots is amazing firstly both because I think he's

507
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,520
 identified a thing in the genre that didn't have a name and given a name which again hallmark of

508
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,880
 very good writing and obviously Neil is genius anyway but also because the number of people on

509
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,480
 Twitter who haven't properly read the essay and are using that word in ways that he doesn't

510
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:59,040
 think it applies is truly hilarious so 10 out of 10 on both fronts so last week I said that my life

511
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:07,760
 had taken a dramatic turn for the worse and I had got deeply into um printed play games so in the

512
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,880
 subsequent fortnight my life has taken a dramatic turn for the worse again and I really upped to my

513
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,160
 lekken print and play games now um to a phenomenal degree I'm still not allowed to spend money

514
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,320
 apparently I was told I was told it was a hyper focus by John and he said you must not spend money

515
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,520
 for a month it's a hyper focus yep and Alison sent me a text message saying has it been a month yet

516
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,040
 and I sent a text message back saying no it has been 15 days which underlines what I say these things

517
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:40,320
 it has it has I think been the longest three weeks the last three weeks have been the longest three

518
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:46,720
 weeks of my life by some considerable margin except me you know so it's been it's been quite a shock

519
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:54,800
 guys yeah but any print and play games still good hey if I'm still doing printed play games in two

520
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,200
 weeks I'll try I'll try to do a proper pick sometime in the next two weeks I should get some time to

521
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,600
 read a book or watch some television or watch a movie that'd be good that was the old thought

522
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:21,520
 podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

523
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,240
 for listeners who are wondering I don't know if this is going to come out in the edit but if it is

524
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,280
 obvious how long my picks are taking after Alison is gone it's because whenever Liz and Alison say

525
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,640
 a thing they have invariably not added it to the show the the big spreadsheet of Hugo eligible

526
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,640
 things and so I am doing that before it gets round to me you're a good you're a very good friend I

527
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,760
 have not been paying a lot attention to the great list of Hugo eligibility thing because I just care

528
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:04,320
 about data unlike you two apparently I was gonna do it later when I'm not also doing a podcast

529
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:13,520
 job well look right we all know that I have bad impulse control the worst yep true the theme music
