1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 So John, you've just devalued the value of John Cox's nomination in my eyes.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,760
 How can I take them seriously now?

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,760
 Also, are you eating a mini-quass hunt?

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
 Yes!

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,560
 You may need to cut that bit too to the chewing noises.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,840
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 85th episode of OctaThorp, a podcast for Science Fiction

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,360
 and Science Fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 8th of June 2023.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,800
 I'm John Coxon.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,320
 I'm Alison Scott.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,440
 And I'm Liz Batty.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,080
 And we are in the summer of fun!

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,840
 Summer of fun!

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,040
 I guess it will be June by the time this is out, which counts as summer.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,040
 The summer has already begun, Liz.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,600
 Yeah, I mean, summer of fun is the period where everyone is having fun and scheduling

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,360
 becomes impossible, right?

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,360
 Yes, the summer of fun started on the 25th of May 2023.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,920
 And you can tell where the surf music.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:15,400
 Because I am in a covered garden outside of barn, in the bits of whales, where I've managed to find some wi-fi.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,800
 I am in Glasgow, in the Crown Plaza, attending Satellite 8, a convention.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,240
 And Liz is in Liz's house and is not such a coffee festival.

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,600
 So, sorry Liz.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,480
 Correct.

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,600
 What do you do?

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,840
 What's a coffee festival like then?

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,360
 Well, I don't know, I'm not there.

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,120
 But I believe it would have lots of stalls from different coffee shops and coffee roasters

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,160
 and lots of coffee to buy and I could get super caffeinated.

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:49,240
 Because I understand what a beer festival is like, but I feel like I could not do what I do

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,720
 at a beer festival, at a coffee festival.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,680
 Yeah, you can't do that unless you can drink infinite amounts of coffee,

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,600
 but you can try a few different coffees and there are more opportunities to say,

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
 buy nice beans and take them home to make your own coffee than at a beer festival,

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,800
 where you might be able to buy like a growlerful, but it's not going to be good forever.

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,880
 It's okay, there will be more coffee.

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,400
 Coffee will continue.

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,200
 So we have some letters of comments.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,840
 So we haven't done letters of comments since EasterCon, or sorry, since we did our

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,680
 EasterCon Roundup episode.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,000
 Tharra Mendelssohn writes in with a photograph of the International Centre

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,760
 of Telford, which reads, "Wales Comic Con Telford Takeover 13th to 14th May."

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,680
 So, yay, Wales.

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,000
 Sandra Bond writes in to say, "So much from my intention to write you a lock on your

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,840
 fan fun discussion in the previous one."

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,720
 Sandra, there's never, there's never not a time where we wouldn't love to get a lock from you.

46
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,560
 I did say that if you wrote us a lock in the next 48 hours after you made that comment,

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,280
 it would get into this episode. Another time, Sandra.

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,200
 You can write locks on episodes as old as you like.

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,480
 There's no statute of lock limitations.

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,280
 Yeah, they don't even have to be very closely related to the episode.

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,800
 It can be very tangential.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,920
 Just write to us, guys.

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,480
 We're very lonely and we like to hear from you.

54
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,000
 We have some emails.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,960
 We have a letter of comment from Chris Garcia.

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,920
 Another excellent episode, entirely focused like a laser with patents,

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,080
 with quite in particular expectations.

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,000
 Thank you very much, Chris.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,600
 And contributes some recommendations for things to nominate for Hugo's.

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,880
 But the nomination deadline has been gone.

61
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,560
 So, we're not going to read the about Chris.

62
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,200
 Also, if you want to know what Chris thinks, you should not know if Hugo's.

63
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,120
 I suspect that there is an issue of the drink tank you could read that would have a lot of detail.

64
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,280
 So, I encourage you all to go and read the drink tank.

65
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,240
 All of it.

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,760
 If you start now, you might have finished by the next episode dropping.

67
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,960
 Although, maybe not.

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,560
 Alex Holdren wrote in and Dave Mansfield wrote in.

69
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,440
 Now, Dave wrote in in the form of a link to an Instagram reel,

70
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,720
 which I am reliably informed by Liz's what happened,

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,240
 because from my perspective, he wrote a DM with no attachment that made

72
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,360
 absolutely no sense.

73
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,200
 And that is because apparently I have to check my Instagram DMs every day

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,840
 in order for reels to still be there when I check them.

75
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,360
 So, listeners, if you send me a message in a medium that requires me to check it on the same day,

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,600
 you may find that that doesn't work.

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,760
 Because I am an enigma.

78
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,880
 I am in the night.

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,360
 Also, I'm very disorganized and sometimes quite busy.

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,400
 So, yes.

81
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,040
 Sorry, Dave.

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,680
 Did not see the thing you posted, which Liz says,

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,880
 "Was you doing the astral pole?"

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
 And that does sound great.

85
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,280
 And I wish I had seen it.

86
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,200
 Because I mean, I assume it was real, but now I'm wondering,

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,400
 did Dave really send me a reel or did I just hallucinate Dave

88
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,760
 doing the astral pole?

89
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,240
 It was very impressive astral pole by I hallucinated, though.

90
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,840
 I regularly do that.

91
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,160
 I got an Instagram DM from Dave,

92
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,440
 but when we tell this to Alison, Alison was like,

93
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,120
 "Hang on, do we have Instagram now?"

94
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,920
 Which tells you how reliably Instagram DMs get through to Alison.

95
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
 But yes.

96
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
 No, he's then a DM with astral pole challenge,

97
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,640
 laughing face, which I assume he had listened to our episode

98
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,440
 and just decided that Instagram was the medium

99
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,800
 with which he would comment on it.

100
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,880
 And I was a bit confused, but I was like, "Oh, that's nice."

101
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,520
 But no, apparently now that I know there was a video there,

102
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,400
 that I now just can't see, it makes way more sense.

103
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,720
 Yeah.

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,840
 No, I check Instagram once a week and I don't normally bother to check my messages

105
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,600
 because they're all gentlemen who tell me the time lovely

106
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
 and would like to get to know me better.

107
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,280
 And I'm not interested in any of them.

108
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,960
 So, sorry, sorry, Dave.

109
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,040
 Mine is mostly scantily clad ladies with a lot of numbers

110
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,680
 after their names being like, "You could get into crypto."

111
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,800
 And I'm like, "No, thanks."

112
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,680
 And that is segmenting marketing.

113
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,320
 I don't get any of these.

114
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,200
 What the fuck have you done to your Instagram saying, guys?

115
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,600
 Because I'm not getting all this kind of shit.

116
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,000
 I don't get many spam DMs.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,080
 Like, I would say I probably get one a month,

118
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,360
 but they are all of the DMs I go on Instagram.

119
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,480
 So like, even though the quantity is not high,

120
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,040
 the ratio is very bad of content to nonsense.

121
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
 Fair enough.

122
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,000
 All right, on to Alex's.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,280
 Alex sent us an email.

124
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,400
 A traditional form of DM.

125
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,320
 About a YouTube video.

126
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,720
 Yes, Alex said he put an email of him doing self doing the astral poll on YouTube 17 years ago,

127
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,120
 but has now unlisted it and very harshly didn't send us the link.

128
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,440
 So you'll have to imagine a very young Alex Holden doing the astral poll.

129
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,800
 I think that will be excellent content for your Instagram channel all about concertino's Alex.

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,160
 Can you use the concertino's to do the astral poll?

131
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,080
 Probably not very good idea with your precious concertino, is it?

132
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,720
 I mean, I do check Instagram once a week and it's nearly always,

133
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,560
 nearly entirely so that I can check out Alex's hot pictures of concertinos.

134
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,640
 That is an entirely different sort of spam DM, I listen.

135
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,200
 So if you're looking for hot pictures of concertinos, I recommend Alex's Instagram.

136
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,680
 But unfortunately not Alex doing the astral poll.

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:13,800
 We got letter from Chris Garcia, where he, I think, is on the John end of the COVID spectrum.

138
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,960
 He writes, "I find it odd that España is the calm, rational voice of reason.

139
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,720
 I don't know this world anymore.

140
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,920
 And Chris, she would say the same thing about you.

141
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,000
 But he does say he doesn't like going to green rooms because it might be his improv training.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,880
 And I'm like, I feel like you can improv in a green room, Chris.

143
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,680
 We did get quite a lot of locks saying that I was totally wrong about COVID.

144
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,920
 So, you know, I might have been.

145
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,400
 We got a variety of locks, which we're not going to go too much into detail because

146
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,200
 I feel like having seen this unfold of various forums, it could go on infinitely.

147
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,800
 That idea fills me with dread.

148
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,480
 Yeah, I don't think, we've had a lot of people's thoughts,

149
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,800
 but I'm not sure we're adding a lot of content to the debate at this point.

150
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,760
 I do think I want to pull out one thing from one of our letters of comment,

151
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,440
 and not because I encourage Abigail to put this in an email.

152
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,040
 We got a letter from Abigail Nussbaum and specifically she was saying that

153
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,280
 Hugo Award-winning fan writer Abigail Nussbaum.

154
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:21,000
 Indeed, Hugo Award-winning fan writer Abigail Nussbaum who points out that the conversation

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,440
 used to come mask policy ended up kind of abandoning panelists on panels a bit,

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,040
 and that she really did not like the option of allowing panelists to ask people in the room

157
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,800
 to mask, which I think we covered, but I think it's worth noting, you do not want to

158
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,640
 have your panelists a con feeling like you have kind of abandoned them for COVID.

159
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,800
 So, I think that is something kind of future.

160
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,960
 Future policies need to take into account, which is like your panelists are showing up

161
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,360
 and basically doing a job for the con, and generally, if they can't do the job for the con

162
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,760
 without feeling like they might get COVID, then they're not going to want to do that job for the con.

163
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,400
 So, it is always a balancing act, but I kind of put a bit more weight on the feelings of the panelists

164
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,640
 than kind of the feelings of the audience watching them in this field.

165
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,920
 I'd agree with that. I mean, the panelists were well spaced from the audience in large,

166
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,840
 well-ventilated rooms, but we were expecting, I think, people to mask more than they did,

167
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,400
 as we said last time. Abigail also said that she really enjoyed conversation.

168
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,320
 I thought it was one of the best conventions she's attended in every other respect apart from this,

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,840
 so, you know, that was kind of nice, but still, sorry, Abigail.

170
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,680
 I'm going to raise one thing, which is we keep saying large, well-ventilated rooms, but

171
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,520
 I think, as we said before, we don't really have a standard for ventilation or any good way of

172
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,880
 doing this. So, I think at some point, fans are going to have to work out what we mean by

173
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,160
 large, well-ventilated rooms, and does that mean going into those rooms with the CO2 monitor at

174
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,720
 some point or asking for specs on the ventilation of the venue, which hopefully venues are going to

175
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,200
 get better at providing, because, you know, we could say large, well-ventilated rooms,

176
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,640
 but I don't think we actually know how much the air is recirculating in there, and so on.

177
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,840
 I like big rooms, and I cannot lie. You other brothers can't deny.

178
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:15,080
 We also heard from, I can't remember if he's written in before, Christopher Garcia,

179
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,320
 who wrote in saying that he liked the special episode, and a face like Glass is the kind he'd

180
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,720
 loved to read, but never seems to get around to, instead it bumps up against me on audible.

181
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,800
 I quite like what he says about, it sounds like a book that pumps ideas into the air,

182
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,560
 and then he spends a week thinking about them, and then kind of they infect his brain, and I know

183
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,040
 what he means. Some of the stuff in a face like Glass, when I was really listening to the conversation

184
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,640
 when I was editing it, I was struck by like how much it had made me start thinking about like

185
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,880
 the power of people to inform the conversation, and how biased the media is towards the powerful,

186
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,160
 and those are all thoughts that are still bouncing around in my head.

187
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,640
 And so I do think there is something there with the infectiousness of the ideas in that book,

188
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,600
 that I don't know whether we touched on last episode, because we record that quite quickly

189
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 after finishing the book, I think. And like that was, oh god, when was that? Like a while ago,

190
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,680
 listeners, I don't want to take you too far beyond the curtain, but suffice to say, it was like

191
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,480
 months, and those ideas have been bouncing around in my little cranium for a while since, so

192
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,480
 yeah, no, I think he's got a point there. Oh, and the mastodons, we got two.

193
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,760
 Tammy Goxon wrote in to say that it was an excellent octop, thank you.

194
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,280
 Zambia programming software came out of Erisia, and they had a registration system that was called

195
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:45,080
 Congo, as in Congo, and then Zambia was the system they made to fit into it in a sort of,

196
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,600
 you can see how that ended up happening, but yeah. On the naming of things.

197
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,280
 And so yep, no, that is that is fan history we were unaware of. Thank you very much, Tammy.

198
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:02,120
 I still think Ariadne is good, and then you could rename the registration system like

199
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,520
 after a different spider, like Boris or Charlotte. We got a letter from Randy Smith, and I'm not sure

200
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:16,920
 Randy's written to us before saying that when he stood for TAF, around for TAF in 2015,

201
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,160
 he chose nominators based on who do I think I can get? That is a model.

202
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,920
 No, I think that is very reasonable. I read a new fan scene by a new person. Martin Petto.

203
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,240
 Martin Petto, just the other day. Yes, so Martin has done a fan scene called Moon

204
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:44,040
 Moot, and it has the return of fanboys and Alison has spoiled my pick, but oh, sorry, shit.

205
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,920
 No, that's all right. I've said to have a letter of comment. Andrew Hogg has

206
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,120
 redone some fanboys books, books, comics, which is very good. And no, it's very well designed.

207
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,600
 It is its landscape. Yes, it's designed for reading on iPads.

208
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,760
 Oh, it is. Yeah, I approve. He says a podcast is a fan scene made of talking,

209
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,720
 and Nick Fairey would have issues with that, Martin. But anyway, yes, so there are new fanzies,

210
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,720
 and one way, one of the best ways of getting your fan scene into in front of the eyeballs of

211
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,120
 people who read the old fanzies is to send it to Bill Burns to push it on efansy.com,

212
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,400
 which is what Martin Petto did. I don't think I know Martin. He made us some lovely slides for

213
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,360
 Eastercon. Yeah, no, I mean, part of the fan scene is about your lovely slides. The last thing I was

214
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,280
 going to say on nominators is so, guys, if you're thinking of running for a fanfunk, get in touch.

215
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,080
 We will, we may not nominate you, but we will put you in the direction of likely nominators.

216
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:50,440
 So we heard from Raj. Raj agrees with Alison. He's got his first con since the before times

217
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,400
 coming up soon, which is the con I am at now listeners. And he says he thinks he's coming down

218
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,120
 more on the Alison side of the argument than mine. Fair enough Raj. We are now nemesis.

219
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,440
 And he says, I raise a good point. I know with friends again about getting boosters from boots,

220
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,520
 which yes, if politicians keep comparing COVID to flu, they need to explain why we can't get the

221
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,320
 same projections as the former as we can against the latter. There's a very nice point Raj.

222
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:23,640
 I liked that sentence a lot. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. And also they love the private sector. Why can't

223
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,160
 the private sector sell us a load of COVID jobs? In the show notes for the last episode,

224
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,480
 or no, sorry, in the show notes for the episode before last, we said there are no picks this

225
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,280
 episode. What have you been reading? And Raj was the only person who wrote in. So Raj is going to get

226
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:44,040
 to have his pick on October. He has picked the very secret society of irregular witches by

227
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:51,800
 Sangumandana, which is a cozy fantasy that melted his heart. So, I might look that up. It sounds

228
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,120
 interesting. It's a great title. Yeah, I'm going to say I've not heard of that. It sounds good.

229
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,840
 Thank you, Raj. Soon we will be obsolete because soon the podcast will just be locks.

230
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:09,560
 I say soon. This episode listeners, this episode DC wrote in saying that they enjoyed the last

231
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,360
 podcast and they agreed that conversation did the hybrid convention thing. Excellently

232
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,520
 is also reminding themselves to read more Francis Harding. She's so good. And she also seems to be

233
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,240
 lovely person. Agreed on both fronts DC. Oh, that was a lot of locks. Yeah.

234
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:37,400
 This morning, while I was at breakfast at the convention, I got an email from Chicon 8

235
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,280
 announcing that they are doing partial membership reimbursements. So, if you volunteered or were

236
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:53,000
 on programme for Chicon 8, keep an eye on your email. They say that you will, they are offering

237
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,960
 a standard reimbursement amount to all qualifying staff, volunteers and programme participants as

238
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,920
 follows. And it's between 60 and 80 dollars, depending on how many people choose to take up this offer

239
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,280
 for adult attending. And if you have virtual attending, it's 40. So, hurrah.

240
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,840
 I think it's very nice of them to include the virtual attending members as well. I mean,

241
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,240
 obviously it's not really been a decision previous cons for to make, but it's nice to reimburse them,

242
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,240
 especially as you know, lots of volunteers and programme participants would be doing a lot of

243
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,000
 work virtually. Mm hmm. Oh, it's good. It's good stuff. Yes. Tell us about the convention.

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I am at satellite eight, which is the eighth convention in the satellite convention series,

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,600
 which are held at the Crown Plaza Hotel in Glasgow. Guests who honour Christopher Priest and fan

246
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,040
 guest of honour, Michelle Cuddles, Dreeton Harald. Chris Priest is being very Chris Priest on all

247
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,680
 of the programme I have seen him on, seen him on, which is very good. Meg McDonald managed to persuade

248
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,080
 him to give a reading at the start of his guest of honour interview, which he introduced by saying

249
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,680
 I hate doing readings. And then Meg was like, but I did ask very nicely. And then he stopped. And

250
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,880
 then he said, I'm going to stop there because I hate doing it. And I'm like, fair enough.

251
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,800
 It was good. But yeah, lovely little, lovely little relaxer con. How many, how many people

252
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:24,120
 are there, would you say? Mm hmm, 100 maybe. Also, it's tiny. Yeah, it's nice. Oh, and there's

253
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,320
 a scavenger hunt and more conventions should have scavenger hunts. If you're running a scavenger hunt,

254
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,720
 and you haven't got a convention, no, wrong. If you are running a convention, you haven't got a scavenger

255
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,560
 hunt, fix that now, now. So basically they've hidden, it's not really, I guess it's not really

256
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:45,880
 a scavenger hunt. So treasure hunt. They've hidden pictures of astronauts around the hotel and you've

257
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,320
 got to find 42 astronauts. And there's a prize. Don't know what the prize is. Don't care. The

258
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,880
 point is filling in the list. The prize is the satisfaction. But yes, found the last three

259
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:04,040
 yesterday in between karaoke. So it was good. And yeah, so the satellite conventions are all themed

260
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:11,240
 around like space exploration, or kind of, well, fastest space exploration. So they're kind of my

261
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:19,640
 bag anyway. And I volunteered for ops. Oh, do you get like a walkie-dockie and a shiny vest? No.

262
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,200
 For 100% conventions, that would be excessive, I think. You get it's a badge. I get a badge that

263
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,480
 says ops. Oh, I get to sit behind a desk and people come in and say, can I sign up for a thing? And

264
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,440
 I'm like, yes. Except for if they want to sign up for the cheesecake tasting, in which I'm like,

265
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,000
 no, because it was full. I went to the cheesesteing. It was bloody brilliant.

266
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,840
 How was the cheese? Good cheese. We were driving to the middle of Wales on Friday. And I noticed a

267
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:55,080
 size saying cheese making next right. And so we stopped doing what we were doing and drove to the

268
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,000
 place of cheese making. And they were not cheese making, but they did have a lot of their own

269
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,240
 cheese. And they said, would you like some lunch? And I said, what sort of lunch do you have? And

270
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,560
 they said, well, we have a cheese platter for two. And I said, that sounds very good. So there was

271
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,600
 so much cheese. I had to bring cheese away with me. So I have, I have cheese tucked into the fridge

272
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,640
 here, despite the fact that they're also feeding us a lot here as well. So cheese, cheese is good.

273
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,960
 Yep. But it was cheese as I've never, cheese as I've never had before that I made it this one

274
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,560
 dairy that just makes cheese, local cheese for local people. It's practically on their mission

275
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,240
 statement. It's like we will make, we will make cheese and distribute it within herrifucher.

276
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,480
 I was like, okay, that's, that's fine. That's a take. I like herrifucher. Speaking of cheese,

277
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,800
 I just want people to know the types of the last, the cover for the last episode entirely on my

278
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,240
 phone on the train, which I think is a first for me. I was so proud of myself. And it has cheese on

279
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,960
 it. Imaginary cheese. Does have cheese. Good. Cheese. It's, it's kind of a relatively small

280
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,800
 convention. There's two or three program tracks, depending on how you look at it. And there's nothing

281
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,320
 opposite the guest of honor items, which I kind of love. At 11, there is a program item

282
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:16,280
 about moving to Scotland. So, you know, it's a recruitment drive. Scotland does seem nice.

283
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:23,560
 A data point, Liz. I went to a bar in Glasgow that was selling beer for £7.20 a point.

284
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:29,560
 Yeah. This has been beer price roundup with Liz. We're going to need a chapter art,

285
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,480
 Alison. Beer price roundup, right? It's very high.

286
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,160
 Bredeemer the crown plaza. Is it a venue for Glasgow in 2024?

287
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,720
 It is. I mean, Bredeemer will be a hotel for Glasgow in 2024.

288
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,400
 It is both. I don't know how much of the space is being used for conventionally things.

289
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,040
 They are. They are, in fact, using all of the spaces in this hotel for Glasgow in 2024.

290
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,760
 I don't know exactly what they use in the fort. I don't think program have gone on the tour of the

291
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:06,440
 venue to work out what is being used for what yet. So like, I don't know. I don't think areas

292
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,760
 have been bagzied for specific uses yet. But I know I think they have the entire SECC. And I

293
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,960
 think they have all of the space in this hotel except for maybe one of the big halls which they

294
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,440
 have an option on but they haven't committed to yet. I believe is the case. But yes. So lots

295
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,560
 of program space in this hotel, which is very nice. I mean, there's an Easter cons worth of

296
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,560
 program space as long as your Easter cons quite small in the crown plaza.

297
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:38,200
 Yeah. I don't know if it's had any change or updates since I last went to it in 2006. But I

298
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,640
 mean, I know the area has because they've obviously built like the Hydro and I think some more hotels

299
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,600
 in the car park. But I would assume the crown plaza is largely the same. They might have painted it.

300
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:55,480
 Well, and also you get free stuff. I mean, free are users of term neglecting the price of the room.

301
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,320
 But it's nice that you get like loads of light bottles of like water and a couple of

302
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,240
 bottles of beer and a couple of cans of wine and stuff. So that's been quite cool.

303
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,920
 Which means you can dip up to the room and like have refreshment, which is lovely.

304
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,680
 And the breakfast is very good. It doesn't have mushrooms, but it does have haggis.

305
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,720
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it cans of wine?

306
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,520
 Yes. Are you sure that's not a mini bar and you'll discover you'll be in charge for the

307
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:28,200
 ball at the end of your stay? Rang down a nest. But yeah, no. I can't remember. The cans of wine

308
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,800
 have a pun on them, but the cans are wearing no longer in the fridge on account of how we drank

309
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,600
 them. So I can't trade what the pun was, but there is a pun. I mean, like it's not fantastic.

310
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,760
 I mean, obviously the tea cakes, which are great. I don't know how much of this was here

311
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,040
 when I was here for satellite four, because when I was here for satellite four, I was a PhD student.

312
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:52,680
 And so my like ability to go out for dinner was less than it is now. But there's like a lot of

313
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,400
 restaurants on our Gile Street, which is like a 10 minute walk away. And there's just like so

314
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,080
 much good food and drink there. It's really nice. I mean, for the world con, I guess you're going to

315
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,920
 need to like try and book and make sure that you have a table planned. But that is really,

316
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,920
 really good. We went to a place called the Tap House. Was that what you had? You said

317
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,840
 £7.20 a pint of beer? Yep. It was very good though. Local brewery. I think it's bad to say that

318
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,560
 they also did pines for like £5.20. But that was if you wanted like a pint of Blue Moon or a pint

319
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:32,200
 of like something equally generic. If you wanted good beer, it was more. But that is kind of the

320
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:39,160
 that's kind of the way of nice beers unfortunately. Yes, it's like this lovely pub in Paddington that

321
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,720
 Claire has found. It's like a pub except perfect in every respect. And the one respect to which

322
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,040
 it might not be absolutely perfect is that everything is very expensive. Yes. Yeah, I, the only satellite

323
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,360
 I've been to is the Eastcon. Every single time I think, oh yes, that would be good. We should do that.

324
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,800
 We've never managed it. I don't even make it to the Eastcon because that was the year of Worldcon.

325
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,960
 And so I was spending all my free time and money on Worldcon. Yep. I mean, I really did enjoy the

326
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,280
 Eastcon that there was there though. It was fantastic. I'd be very also bought a house. So

327
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,880
 that took up a lot of my time and attention rather than a thing to come.

328
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:31,000
 Mm-mm. There has been some discussion about whether or not people think that the Hugo award

329
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,520
 nominees will be highly skewed towards Chinese language works or not in the last few weeks.

330
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,680
 We are recording this before the lists are up. We are mindful of the fact that the episode might

331
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:50,280
 come out after the list has dropped. So we're going to do some discussion of that without knowing

332
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:57,480
 what will happen listeners. Oh, oh, oh. Octa thought pontification corner. Basically,

333
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:06,120
 we're either going to look super smart or completely opposite. So let's do it. Alison,

334
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:14,360
 what is your view of this? My view of this is that there will not be any or maybe one or two,

335
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:22,040
 but almost certainly no Chinese language finalists on the Hugo ballot. And my reason for thinking this

336
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,360
 is that I don't think the vast majority of Chinese SF fans have any concept of what the

337
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,280
 hugas are or what they do. I don't think they're very interested in it. And I don't think they are.

338
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,680
 I'm not seeing any evidence that there's any sort of science fiction world magazine

339
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:46,840
 right could have could have run a campaign to get Chinese fans to nominate. And I think if

340
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,480
 you'd have done this, they would have done. And we would we would know it was happening.

341
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,760
 And we have not seen anything of that kind. And so I don't think it's going to happen.

342
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:03,880
 So I think I agree. And part of the reason I agree is that there have been two previous years,

343
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,480
 the Japanese Worldcon and the Finnish Worldcon have both occurred in my time in fandom.

344
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,400
 And obviously I suspect a lot of Japanese Finnish people do speak English. But what we didn't see in

345
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,800
 either of those years was a lot of Japanese or Finnish language science fiction on the ballot.

346
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,760
 And now I don't know whether that's because those countries just don't have as much science

347
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,800
 fiction as China does because I don't have a good view of international science fiction listeners.

348
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:39,240
 But I do it would it would be interesting if China is the one that proves the exception to the rule

349
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,920
 because so far the Hugo has been remarkably resilient to being held in countries that

350
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:51,000
 are not first language English. And like I don't know. Maybe that is a fool's extrapolation.

351
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,440
 But that is just kind of where I'm at. I wonder whether the same thing will happen this time.

352
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,800
 What do you think Liz?

353
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,600
 Well I mean it would be quite easy for me to at this point say I think there will be at least one

354
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,040
 Chinese language nominee on the ballot. And then since you guys have picked zero I will look smart

355
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,400
 if there's any. So I'm going to do that. Yep. But no I think I think it's might be the year. So I think

356
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,680
 in the year of Helsinki the thing is I think because all the Finnish fans firstly the Finnish

357
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,640
 fans were still a minority of the people nominating you know because there were huge numbers of

358
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,320
 British American fans who had signed up for the vote and not and they many of those voted for

359
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,920
 Helsinki. It wasn't purely Helsinki fans whereas in Chengdu it was a lot more. The Helsinki fandom

360
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,160
 as far as I know basically when I met at the convention was through in English and while they

361
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,960
 were reading Finnish language and Swedish language science fiction they're also reading a lot of

362
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,920
 English language science fiction. And also I will say for Chengdu I just don't really have any insight

363
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:55,240
 into what's going on because I just cannot read any of their social media. I can't read any websites

364
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,800
 so I see any discussion. So I think given the number of them who are fully signed up as members

365
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:08,760
 thanks voting in DC and given that some of the categories have incredibly low numbers of

366
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,880
 nominators either they just have a very low number altogether or they have a really really broad

367
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:20,360
 spread like in short story where you have a lot of nominators but a massive spread. I think there

368
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:26,920
 will be some categories with Chinese language nominees or Chinese people who blog or podcast

369
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,640
 or write in the Chinese language. Possibly in things like short story where I don't think it would take

370
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,480
 a lot of votes from China if they coalesce around a small number of stories. You know if there are

371
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:46,120
 3,000 votes from Anglophone readers but we pick 300 stories and then there are 200 votes from

372
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,960
 Chinese members who pick a small number even with the purpose you go still in effect I think that

373
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,440
 would still get them a nominee. And then when you get down to categories like best fan artists,

374
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,760
 fan cast, fanzine, fan rights and extent where you don't need a huge number of nominations

375
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,800
 then I can easily see that they might might only need 100 people to get you on the ballot and that

376
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,960
 seems completely possible. So I think there's going to be more than what. What I can't explain

377
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:19,560
 really is why in 2007 there were not any Japanese language nominations but I don't know enough about

378
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,600
 the situation then and you know how many of them had joined up to vote in site selection and things

379
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,720
 like that to really know if it's going to be a big difference but I will stick my neck out and say

380
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,000
 there's going to be some Chinese language nominees on the ballot. Okay so I have a question for you

381
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,440
 Liz. Why were there none last year? Because there were lots of Chinese fans who had joined for site

382
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:46,280
 selection and who could have nominated Hugo's and there were no Chinese language works on the ballot

383
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,880
 then. So what do you think has changed in the intervening year? Is it just that the ratio of

384
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,440
 Chinese to American fans? Because I think we know that there were more Chinese fans who had signed

385
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,440
 up to that Worldcon than American ones for site selection but I don't have a feel for like what

386
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,960
 the absolute ratios were. Yeah okay you do have a good point there which may undermine my theory

387
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,360
 but my other theory would be that as far as I know when Chai Khan sent out you know email communications

388
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,880
 and opening nominations and so on. So what I don't know is whether the fact that Chengdu will

389
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:24,120
 have been emailing all its members in you know their native language will have made a difference

390
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,480
 of their kind of awareness about being able to vote in the Hugo's being able to nominate stuff

391
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,920
 and whether there is a set of fandom who just weren't aware that they had those you know nomination

392
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,440
 rights for Chai Khan. I sort of agree with that but in the last five minutes I have been checking

393
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:47,160
 the internet and have also checked the nomination lists for the two Worldcons that were non-anglophone

394
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:57,240
 countries before John's memory which were Python in 1970 and Confiction in 1990 and none neither of

395
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,600
 those ballots contained any non-English language works as far as I can tell. So that's true but I

396
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:09,480
 think it's also like I think the landscape has totally changed since Worldcons of the 1990s

397
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,840
 in terms of how many people nominate and I mean also the voting vote counting has changed.

398
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:23,400
 And also I would say I don't know I mean I know there is like a thriving kind of you know there is

399
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:31,160
 a German language SFC and there is a Dutch language SFC but how much of that is there and how much

400
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:36,680
 crossover is there between fans of that and also fans who are reading in English language as well.

401
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,520
 Like I can believe there is a big segment of fans who are signed up to Chengdu Woken who do not

402
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,560
 habitually read any science fiction in English and I suspect a lot more of the German and Dutch

403
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,600
 fans were reading things in English. I think all of them were maybe not absolutely all of them but

404
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,320
 the vast majority of Dutch fans at Confiction and almost certainly also the German fans at

405
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,640
 Hijkon of whom there weren't actually the old not many were reading English language SFCs

406
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:11,000
 even in 1990 remarkably little SFC was available in Dutch translation this was one of the things

407
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,080
 that the Dutch fans complained about a great deal. I mean there is a thing on

408
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:24,120
 on file 770 just to remind me is that there was no like Chinese language ballot for Shikon and

409
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,520
 apparently there had never been one previously so when they're in Germany in the Netherlands they

410
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,520
 also didn't translate the Hugo ballots and I'm pretty sure they didn't do it for Helsinki either.

411
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,640
 So I think this Worldcon maybe the first time they've actually had a bilingual ballot could be

412
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,440
 interesting. I thought that was a Finnish one. Finn's right in. Yeah I did think there was a Finnish

413
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,680
 language one but I don't know I mean so much that Helsinki was done in English it almost felt like

414
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,560
 there are like Worldcons which have had the program tracks in other languages but it's always been

415
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,160
 very much a kind of minority thing and I think most of the people you know on the

416
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,280
 banish or Polish or Irish language tracks have also been taking part in the English language one.

417
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:16,200
 Yeah Pics he wants to do their first pick. So you would think I would have a good pick at this

418
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,720
 point but apparently I've spent the last month and a half reading non-science fiction books

419
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:28,360
 watching non-science fiction television and films playing non-science fiction video games or

420
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,360
 doing all those things but not wanting to actually recommend them. So you're going to get a podcast

421
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:38,120
 recommendation which feels very cheeky so it feels like I'm piggybacking on everyone else's

422
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:44,040
 podcast recommendation but essentially lots of people last year recommended the Going Rogue

423
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:50,120
 podcast by Tanzi Garden who did a podcast all about the making of Rogue One which I have not listened

424
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,680
 to yet because I feel I need to rewatch Rogue One before I listen to it so it's on my list but she

425
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,560
 has a new podcast series currently running which is called Striking Out and it is all about the

426
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:09,320
 2007-2008 writer strike through stories of the shows and films that were running at the time so

427
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,720
 it's obviously very timely given we're in the middle of another writer strike and the first few

428
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,440
 episodes are out and there's no about you know Quantum of Solace the the bomb film and how the

429
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,240
 writer strike affected that and then also about the office the US one which is very interesting

430
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,720
 because I hadn't realized it was such a big thing in the very early days of streaming and it was

431
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:36,120
 really interesting to hear about kind of you know how they felt getting the the right residuals for

432
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,840
 streaming episodes of the office was a big thing in 2008 and obviously has paved the way for what

433
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:47,160
 is now a massive massive thing is an entertaining podcast Tanzi Garden is obviously very well read

434
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,920
 well informed and fun to listen to and I recommend you give it a go I may be nominated for Hugo next

435
00:34:52,920 --> 00:35:00,280
 year now I'm going where we use on my list of things to listen to but I'm a bit behind on podcasts

436
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:08,520
 ever since I discovered that you can watch all of Durham County cricket clubs matches on YouTube

437
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,040
 because then I do that instead of listening to podcasts and there's bad I listen to them on my

438
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,640
 commute and my commute is very short so that's the problem now actually the problem is that you

439
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,360
 know during cycling when tours I try and listen to like two and a half daily podcasts so that's

440
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,080
 the problem I mean that does sound like a very interesting podcast it is go and listen to it okay

441
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:35,160
 shall I do my pick so I am going to pick another Apple TV show I do I do watch other TV that's not

442
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:41,320
 Apple TV sometimes but anyway this was recommended to me by Abigail Nespam who said this is Sunk Below

443
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:48,920
 Trace it is Shining Girls a eight part series based on Lauren Buke's book and starring Elizabeth

444
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:58,360
 Moss as a woman who some years ago was attacked by a psychopath and survived and is now trying to

445
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:06,360
 piece together what appears to be a series of quite strange serial killings I think it's not you know

446
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,160
 I'm picking it so it is genre it sounds like it's not genre but it is it is science fiction as well

447
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:18,520
 as being a thriller obviously it is all very beautiful and very put together and all of the

448
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,000
 performances are marvelous and I have a slight hesitation about it because A) I haven't quite finished

449
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,840
 it yet so this is another pick where I am halfway through a series and picking it but B) it does have

450
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:35,560
 quite a lot of emery-drating content about dead women and stalking women which is not my favorite

451
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,640
 topic but everything about else about the show is so good to the time colour letting it

452
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,880
 off a bit but it's very good and almost nobody seems to have mentioned it it's sort of come up

453
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,080
 it came up in Abigail's Hugo List but that was the first I'd heard of it and I don't think I've

454
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,600
 seen anything else about it on any of my socials so so I feel like yeah this is this is something

455
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,680
 that you might be interested in especially if if you like that kind of thriller science fiction

456
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,720
 crossover genre thing which you might I was surprised you liked it because you are a

457
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:16,840
 confirmed wuss which is a word you have used to describe yourself and this yeah wait till we get

458
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:23,480
 to me talking about six weeks Boiler you never did six weeks oh wow okay you are more of a

459
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,840
 but hang on okay so you your finalist but China goes way worse than six weeks I mean I've only read

460
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:34,840
 the book I haven't watched the TV series yet but like um China goes it's like really creepy yes I

461
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,120
 think the TV series is quite careful right yeah no China girls is super creepy six weeks is not

462
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:46,520
 so creepy but no so China girls is is incredibly creepy we're having to watch an episode of Lower

463
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:53,400
 Decks immediately after it every time so that it is not sitting in my brain at bedtime so so it is

464
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,000
 like it's a kind of guarded pick right it's right at the edge but I think they've been careful I

465
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,720
 think they're kind of they're trying to make prestige TV and so they've been quite careful

466
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,400
 about the ways in which they're doing all the really scary stuff and I know that some people

467
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,480
 have bounced off the novel for this but for this reason as well that they found it too too horrible

468
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:26,840
 yeah I read Moxieland when it was it was the free book at the Eastercon in 2009 I can't remember

469
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,720
 going back a while and I read it and then when Zu T came out I read that and then when China

470
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,960
 goes came out I read that I am I am but I knew they were doing a TV show of it

471
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:43,640
 but Aaron is like not bubbled to the top of my two watch list yet yeah same for me I

472
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,920
 I read the book I'm aware of it I just haven't got around watching too much stuff not enough time

473
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,680
 yes so I don't know how it finishes yet so though I have a I have a guess I have a

474
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:59,960
 spoilery prediction for how it's gonna all unravel I am gonna pick so an anecdote I went to the house

475
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:08,440
 of noted critic Neil Harrison and noted critic Nick Clark and noted critic Mosker the Cat

476
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:16,360
 and breakfast and we watched movies we were stormy Monday with sting and a very young Sean Bean

477
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,560
 which is very good ah and we watched the menu and we watched a random episode of the West Wing

478
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:29,400
 and over breakfast the conversation turns to how we haven't picked all these worlds reviews and essays

479
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,960
 by Neil Harrison yet on this very podcast in fat listeners you may not be aware that Neil

480
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,320
 Harrison has written a series of reviews which is then collected into a book which is called

481
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,520
 all these worlds reviews and essays by Neil Harrison and I have finished the book it's quite good

482
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:53,560
 and this is the sort of incisive criticism which is why I do not have a collection of my criticism

483
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:02,920
 written into 161 000 words of genius but no it is extremely good don't you find you want to argue

484
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,880
 with him on every single page because that's what reviews of critics criticism do for me generally

485
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,160
 I go oh yes well there he's so wrong about all this stuff no I think good so I think this is the

486
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,360
 difference between good criticism and bad criticism which is I think bad criticism makes me want to

487
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,320
 argue and I think good criticism introduces me to a viewpoint I hadn't considered before

488
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,840
 if my first instinct is to argue I think it means you haven't properly explained your point

489
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,120
 because it means it's not in my brain enough because I think I would have to be and I think

490
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,800
 trying to think of a way to say this nicely I think I would have to be very sure of the

491
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,920
 primacy of my own opinions for someone very wise to say something and then for me to be like oh

492
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,200
 but you haven't considered it properly and argue with them okay so the very first thing I would

493
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,720
 recommend to you for reading non-fiction with a critical eye to start to develop your critical

494
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:59,880
 skills is to always be thinking who is this person and why are they lying to me you know what is

495
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,040
 what are the holes in the things that I am reading where can I find the holes in this argument have

496
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,680
 they been patched why have they not been patched this is like this is like what critical analysis

497
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:17,960
 is it's like the number one thing you do is go right what this is a point of view so I listen I

498
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,760
 don't know if you know this but I've been a scientist for 11 years now and I read scientific

499
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:29,640
 journals so I am aware of this thank you you don't need to explain it I think that a good critic

500
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:37,160
 doesn't make me think that they are deliberately including part of the discussion in order to try

501
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,840
 to light me I think a lot of critics do do that and it drives me up the fucking wall the thing I

502
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:49,080
 love about Harrison's criticism the thing I absolutely adore about it is that he actually admits the

503
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:55,880
 parts where he is taking a line and he thinks about all of these books as a holistic whole and

504
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,760
 instead of trying to sell you his opinion of them he talks about them in a way that's full enough

505
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,000
 that he can explain what his opinion is but he can also explain why his opinion may not be your

506
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,280
 opinion and take other people's opinions into account as he does it and he does that fantastically

507
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,480
 and so I don't need to do that when I read Harrison's criticism because Harrison is doing it for me

508
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,000
 and that is what makes him one of the preeminent voices of his generation I mean I have not read

509
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,480
 this book yet there are two copies of it on myself uh waiting for me to read it I'm very

510
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,840
 sorry getting around to reading books on paper nowadays maybe I should just buy the Kindle copy

511
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,920
 as well then I will read it why have you got two copies one of them is is me um shuffling one to

512
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,360
 the opposite side of the world on a planet trip later this year there is a reason for it one of

513
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:47,720
 them is not technically mine this is a book mule the fur zat yeah and bookmule fur zat I mean in

514
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,560
 some ways it'll make sense but I know I will see him in a few months time and so it made sense for

515
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,200
 me to take one at the time get it signed and hand it over to him I thought we were going to have a

516
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,840
 podcast where all three of us picked but I have the I have three copies of Neil's book so I outrank Liz

517
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:09,080
 I have the ebook and then I have the paper book that's signed and then I have the paper book that's

518
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:15,800
 unsigned you've got the rare on side copy yes well I bought it well no I didn't buy it I've

519
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:22,600
 bought one copy but I have three copies because I did the type saying so I got a contributors copy

520
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,360
 and Neil gave it to me in his house I forgot to come to sign it and then at east to come we bid on

521
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:34,760
 the one that came with the free review or more more he's reading ijedi by michael staepole oh yeah

522
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,840
 okay because we are bad bad men is that not a particularly good book

523
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:51,080
 that was very good laugh john loves it very much so there's a thing here which is that my

524
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:57,560
 star wars fandom is like partly the films like the original trilogy and it's partly the new

525
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,400
 the sequel films but then the other strand so like I got into the original trilogy when I was like

526
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:10,200
 a kid like like you know it must have been what a seven no nine I enjoyed the very much

527
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,120
 and then like you fall off the wagon a little bit and then when I was a teenager I read the

528
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,720
 rose quadrant novels by michael staepole and they kind of re-ignited my star wars fandom and ijedi

529
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:27,560
 is kind of the fifth book in that sequence but kind of not it's kind of part of a series of books I

530
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:35,400
 loved very very much but I can't pretend it was good I strongly suspect it's bad but Neil's gonna

531
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:42,600
 read it and it's only 200 000 words long 200 000 words yeah well because it's because it's the

532
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:48,600
 sequel to a four book sequence and it's also telling the same story as a trilogy of books which

533
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,720
 are happening at the same time but it's telling it from a different perspective so it's a good

534
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,360
 self-contained novel to get Neil to read we're basically just very bad friends

535
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:04,840
 or good friends but he hasn't started reading it it's on his um table

536
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:12,120
 well does he have like a succession of to be read does he have a complicated to be read system

537
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:21,720
 don't know actually he like I don't know but I think yes well so they've just recently decluttered

538
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,520
 a lot of books and like I know several of those books are books that were on the 2b read pile

539
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,560
 and are now on the this will never get read pile which is why they're being decluttered

540
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,440
 so I think their 2b read pile is like definitely non-trivial but I haven't asked

541
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,200
 Neil if you're listening write in with a detailed explanation of your 2b read system

542
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,160
 it's also a very fetching shade of green yeah no I'm sorry for setting you off John

543
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,920
 that's right I'm sorry for being set off yeah but you did you had just gone said yeah it's good

544
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,160
 I like it so you know well it is good Alison I do like it

545
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:01,880
 well I mean I would agree with you that Neil is one of the foremost critical critics of our age

546
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:09,000
 I was so you should say um on the pod because I think I mention it in the third row panel

547
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,040
 but I should say it somewhere like out loud which is the reason that this book exists

548
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,640
 and the reason I think a large part of the reason I don't know if it's the whole reason I don't want

549
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,040
 to speak for Neil but I know a large part of the reason that Neil has returned to write a column

550
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:30,520
 for Strange Horizons and has returned to criticism in recent months is the fact that

551
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:36,120
 conversation invited him to be a guest of honor because I think he felt it was a very great I

552
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,840
 think he felt it was like a validation of him as a critic and a validation of his place in the field

553
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:46,040
 and in an external way where he he said to me one of the reasons why he decided to do a book is

554
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,760
 that being invited to be a convention guest of honor felt a bit like a publisher expecting interest

555
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,480
 in a collection he was like this this shows the community interested in my criticism so like

556
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,040
 it shows that I can do this book and then I think but all this to say I don't think we would have

557
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,800
 the book and I don't think we would have Neil doing more and more criticism now if it wasn't for

558
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,920
 the fact he had been a guest of honor and so I will say I want to say thank you to conversation

559
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,080
 for doing that because I think it is for the good of the field that that has happened but also I

560
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,280
 want to say to conventions who are considering the guests of honor this is something you might

561
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:25,720
 want to consider when selecting guests of honor is selecting guests who might find the honor

562
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,520
 invigorating in a way that will mean that they return to what it is they're known for in a way

563
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,160
 that does benefit everyone and I think that is a very that is a very powerful thing to be able to

564
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,400
 do if you are a convention committee and it is a gift you have that not many do and so yes thank

565
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:48,920
 you to conversation and perhaps who's thought for others ties neatly into my kind of philosophy on

566
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,440
 what being an east con guest of honor should be which is that it it should be an honor that it

567
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:01,800
 that we should be picking people who who we honor by by having them as as our guests and and then

568
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:08,120
 the convention should work with the person so that they're what they do is is brought out in the way

569
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,840
 in which they are celebrated as part of the conventions program and I hope we did that with

570
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:18,600
 all of our guests but I think we did do it particularly well with Neil as it happens and if you are

571
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:27,320
 interested in hearing Neil's desert island books then you can go and listen to the sixth episode

572
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,080
 of the critical friends podcast which is the strange horizon's criticism podcast which has an

573
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:43,240
 edited version of the interview and if you're interested in the third row fandom panel it is

574
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:50,760
 now up online on youtube as part of fanak.org's fan history events because it fitted absolutely

575
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,120
 into their um rationale so they were very pleased to have it and thank you to everyone who's on

576
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:02,120
 the panel for letting it go up there so that's those are two examples of stuff from conversation

577
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,480
 that's being preserved um there there will be more but quite a lot of it's sitting in my intro

578
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,680
 which we sorted out at the moment so that was the art of the podcast and it's goodbye for me

579
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:18,040
 it's goodbye for me it's goodbye for me

580
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:36,600
 [Music]

581
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,960
 I don't mind we could we could touch on Hugo we could do like 10 minutes on Hugo's and then do picks

582
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:49,720
 do you want to do i got an idea do we all want to make a guess as to something about the Hugo's

583
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,960
 let's make some kind of guess that can be then easily falsified before this podcast comes out

584
