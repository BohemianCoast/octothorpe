1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
 We are not up to that bit. Stop segueing!

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,240
 Look, right, we read down...

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,960
 So there's this list, and we read down the list in order until we get to the end, and that's how we do.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,320
 I wish Tush has choose your own adventure. If you would like to talk about Joff-Bex, please skip three paragraphs through the show notes.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,360
 Hello everyone, and welcome to the very 31st episode of the OctaThorp podcast.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,080
 This episode is going out on the 13th of May 2021. I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,080
 I'm Alison Scott. I know I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:55,760
 And today we have some letters of comment from our listeners. So firstly, Phil Dyson says that the typical EasterCon tech budget will only buy 40 to 50 Oculus Quest 2 headsets,

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:06,880
 and therefore, I assume what he's suggesting is that we have some sort of sharing arrangement where only 40 or 50 people are allowed to move around the EasterCon space at a time, which, you know, could work.

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,520
 Could be the good ones. Could be the interesting people.

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:21,040
 But that's fine. In year one, we have 40 to 50 people. In year two, we buy another 40 to 50 Oculus Quest headsets, and by like year five, we've got quite a lot of EasterCon going.

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,800
 I mean, even by year five, you've still only got 250, right? Let's not.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,320
 Eh, they're gonna get cheaper.

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,280
 Well, we could do a bit of bring your own device, really, because who would want an Oculus Quest headset that would be passed around the average EasterCon?

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:46,640
 I mean, I'm sure that in our world of coronavirus and the associated trauma, people will be very happy to glue things to their face shortly after they have been on someone else's face.

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:02:02,000
 God, that sounds weird. But yes, no, good point. No, but I think it is safe to say that we are not seriously advocating for the purchase of Oculus Quest for everyone unless an EasterCon chair wins the lottery.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,400
 However, I've just realized that as a whole market for alien face huggers, skins, for Oculus Quest and other VR headsets.

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:18,960
 Hmm, make your technology look more fleshy. Make your technology look more like you've got something hideous stuck to your face.

19
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,600
 Right, speaking of something hideous stuck to your face, we have a lot for Chris Garcia.

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,640
 Now, that is quite the segue. That is quite the segue.

21
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,120
 It's okay, though. You won't mind. I promise you won't mind. I'm fairly pro super mind.

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:43,920
 He says a lot of good things, but the one that stands out to me is he asks, Robin Hobb is a jigsaw fan. Weird. I don't think she'd be a sore enthusiast.

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:52,880
 And that leads me neatly onto. I'm so excited that Spirald is out with Samuel Jackson and Chris Rock. I can't wait. I might actually go see it in the cinema if I get my jabs and it's still in the cinema by then.

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,680
 Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, I love the saw movies. I don't know what the rest of the podcast's opinion on the saw movies is.

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,160
 Are they horror?

26
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,280
 Yeah. Yeah.

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,800
 Yes, I don't know.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
 Fair enough.

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
 And there are eight of them.

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,960
 Then eight, eight times. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,160
 Excellent stuff.

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,600
 Octa no.

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,360
 Far her.

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,880
 Also wrote to us to say that itterbium radically simplified its birth redistribution in October 2018.

35
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,960
 So the things we said about that, they did eventually change it.

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:34,720
 And she also says that she would have had a lot better a time at confusion if they'd had an FAQ sheet with fun things you can look for in gathertales.

37
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,520
 And then we did it again at Follicon.

38
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,960
 And those who went to Alison's excellent Follicon will remember that they did "Eis by the EasterCon".

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:54,880
 Follicon did "Eis by the EasterCon" as a promotion for Follicon because we were a bit at the time at Ennominate, which was at the Hilton Metropolitan in 2017.

40
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,520
 And then we did it again at Follicon.

41
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:05,440
 And I think I have committed to doing one for reclamation and you could easily adapt this for virtual.

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:14,400
 I think if you adapted it for virtual, you'd probably want to engage with the committee to find out what they were going to be doing so that you could put it in your thing.

43
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:27,120
 But the idea of "Eis by" for people who are not familiar with English traditions is that you give a small child a book before you go on a journey or some other boring activity

44
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
 with a long list of things that they could spot on a subject and what's their spot of a sufficient number of them.

45
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,520
 They traded in for it was like membership of the big chief "Eis by tribe".

46
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,880
 But I don't think we do any of that sort of thing anymore.

47
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,560
 So for the EasterCon, we've traded them in for a badge.

48
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
 And that was what we would do again.

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,680
 And it was pretty good.

50
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,800
 People like it, kids like it, newbies like it.

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,720
 Lots of people who need the kids on newbies but like collecting things like it. So yeah, it's pretty good.

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,680
 Do it again.

53
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
 But you definitely want to do it to virtual con.

54
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,480
 So I guess we should probably have a nice spike punctuation and I think I may have given myself an action.

55
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,120
 Oh dear.

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,360
 So yes, "Eis by the badge in ribbon" works perfectly well because as anyone who's seen at WorldCon,

57
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,520
 small children with enormous ribbon collections will know they really like collecting ribbons.

58
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,320
 And some adults also have enormous ribbon collections and really like collecting ribbons.

59
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,080
 I also thought I would just draw out Farah's point from her letter that the extra money they had from the

60
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,600
 "Eterbium" bursaries they spent on additional access support, including paying for all of the scooters,

61
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,760
 which I think is actually a good place that Eastercons with surplus money can put their money

62
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,200
 because they do tend to be quite expensive and for a lot of people it's basically an extra cost

63
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,320
 that falls on those with access needs that we can do something about.

64
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,080
 Now you may segue.

65
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,880
 No, it may sense.

66
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,160
 So Roman Orzansky emailed us about Octop 28 and we unfortunately missed it last episode,

67
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,680
 but we're going to read this episode, which is that he writes to us about...

68
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,920
 "A really contentious issue."

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,240
 Yeah, he writes to us about the Ditmar Award for Best Spanish Cat.

70
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,920
 And he...

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,760
 and he...

72
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,400
 alleges that a cat that is not badger is the best Spanish cat.

73
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,720
 And all I can say is that if the owner of said "Cat" wants to donate 70 quid to the League of

74
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,320
 Fan Funds to have us change our minds, then we are happy to be bought.

75
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:35,360
 But for now our allegiances must and will always remain with badger until our financial pickles are tickled.

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,120
 Yeah, we do accept sponsorship though, not so much sponsorship we will become a professional publication.

77
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,640
 Oh no, we don't get any of the money.

78
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,680
 The fan funds, the fan funds get all the money and we get nothing.

79
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,120
 That I feel like we should offer a regular sponsorship as well, you know, it does be clear here.

80
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,520
 But only for cats.

81
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,280
 Yeah.

82
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,080
 B.S, thank you very much Roman. I did not know we will put a link in the show notes

83
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,720
 to the File 770 article on the Best Spanish Cat.

84
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,000
 And thank you very much to Roman for bringing us to... for bringing that to our attention.

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,560
 Roman speculates that badger is not so far won an award for Best British Spanish Cat.

86
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,720
 And now I'm wondering is there an award for Best British Spanish Cat?

87
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,080
 Do we want to speculate on who would be on the shortlist for Best British Spanish Cat?

88
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,440
 Bearing in mind that there are, I would guess, semi-official octa-thorpe host cats.

89
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,320
 So I think what we really need to do is we need to launch a campaign for the B.S.F.A.

90
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,400
 to introduce a new B.S.F.A. award for Best Spanish Cat. I'm sure this will go well.

91
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,960
 But if the dipmars can have brilliant awards, then why can't the eastercon?

92
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,360
 That sounded like I was casting more shade on the B.S.F.A. than I intended to.

93
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,160
 Announcing the octos, the official octa-thorpe awards, there is only one category which is Best

94
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,200
 Spanish Cat. Best British Spanish Cat, obviously.

95
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,000
 Anyway, yes, let's do octa-thorpe awards because the B.S.F.A. probably won't do a Best

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,520
 Cat. I think the problem I would have with a Best Spanish Cat award is unless I could vote for

97
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,880
 all of the cats. It would be really difficult. I mean, imagine having to like rank cats in rank

98
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,280
 order. Yeah, no, that is true. That's fair. So ranking is ranking cats more or less difficult

99
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:35,440
 than herding cats? Yes. Mark Plummer writes an excellent letter of comment in the vein of his

100
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,920
 previous letter of comment. Claire and I were playing Arkham Horror the other day. It was my turn.

101
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,040
 "Have you got Mrs. Cthulhu, the Great Old One's wife?"

102
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,560
 This game is very gendered, said Claire, what with the way all the female characters are

103
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,240
 described by reference to their relationship to male characters, surely it should be Ms.

104
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,720
 Cthulhu, the Great Old One in her own right. Hey, I'm just following the rules on the box.

105
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,800
 It's not as if canonically Cthulhu even has a wife, and is he even a he?

106
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,880
 Well, the Cthulhu's do seem to be a family of sorts. Nuktosa and Nukt Kohu are twin daughters

107
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,120
 of Cthulhu. Kithaig is a half-sister and Yogshofarth and Shavnigar are

108
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
 author grandparents. Nug, however, was merely described as a parent of Cthulhu,

109
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,120
 and Cthulhu was spawned by pathonogenesis. You're just reading the Wikipedia page now,

110
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,960
 aren't you? No, no, it's all here on the box. Anyway, have you? No, my turn. Have you got Mrs.

111
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,960
 Ferdinand C. Ashley, the Miss Catonic University professor's wife. Mark. It's very good. I like

112
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:38,000
 to mark, sent it to us during the last live recording, and I giggled on air. But I will say,

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,840
 one of the things I do adore about the Arkham Horror card game is that it does roughly have

114
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,280
 gender parity in its playable characters, and so it is less representative of the

115
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,040
 Cthulhu mythos in terms of gender and ethnic representation than, well, it's just good.

116
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,720
 They've done good things in that regard. So, you know, hurrah, women and stuff.

117
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,520
 So, you're saying that it's less gendered than happy families?

118
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,080
 I appreciate that's a low bar. Just checking.

119
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,680
 What I like from Mark's letter is that I'm not sure, apart from the name

120
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,840
 "Fulu Yogshofarth and Shavnigararth", which I recognise, I'm not sure which of the other ones

121
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,720
 he has actually read of Wikipedia and which ones are completely made up.

122
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,040
 Oh, I assume it's all 100% true, which one day Mark will use to his advantage

123
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
 to get me to do something unspeakable, er, into my own gullibility?

124
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,880
 I mean, I was going to say that I didn't think you'd practiced all the words before

125
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,400
 reading out the lock, and I had practiced Mark's one last time, and I still made mistakes,

126
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,520
 because I have great difficulty pronouncing the names of old ones, which causes me a real

127
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,920
 problem in my summoning circles, let me sell you.

128
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,560
 Nuktosa and Nuktulhu are hard words to say, which is because their old itch monstrosities

129
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:07,520
 that man was not meant to pronounce. So, we've got a knock. Now, so Jonathan Cowie writes to us

130
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,000
 and says that he's not really written a lock, he's more written a comment, but because he wrote

131
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,240
 the comment in a letter, I would argue it is still a lock, so thank you very much Jonathan, for your

132
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
 lock. I think Jonathan might be one of these letter purists who believes that it's, unless it's

133
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,560
 attached to the email, it's not a letter, or possibly unless it's put in an envelope and put in a,

134
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,840
 in the post with a stamp on it, it's not a letter, but I think that's wrong. I think it's a letter

135
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,840
 of comment, even if he doesn't think so. Well, that's not going to get us furious, uh,

136
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,400
 a letter of the notes or comments from our audience, does it?

137
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,680
 To be fair, because Jonathan starts with this is not really a lock, but it's more a knock or just

138
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,680
 a see, because see is a single letter, therefore if it is a see, it becomes a letter of comment

139
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,720
 by virtue of being only one letter, and so we're right back to locks, but from the opposite meaning.

140
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,040
 Anyway, the substance of Jonathan's note of comment is to say that we were a little bit hard on

141
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,400
 Kevin Stanley, and we might have been. Kevin, um, is saying that, you know, this is a constitutional

142
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,360
 requirement, and therefore he has a good point. Now, I have two reactions to this. Firstly, that is

143
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,560
 very true. Um, it is a constitutional requirement. It is right for Kevin to point out. I think part

144
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,880
 of our reaction was based on the fact that Kevin did point out that this was a constitutional

145
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,240
 requirement, and everyone did say they're there, Kevin. No one, like, no action was taken as a

146
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,360
 result of this being pointed out. It's not that Kevin isn't right, although I think Kevin was

147
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,560
 right to point out. I don't think we were unfair in how we covered it.

148
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:46,160
 Jonathan points out the disc on says that they allow Winnipeg to appear on the site selection

149
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,480
 ballot using their discretion, and he argues, as did Dave Langford and asked, answer all that what

150
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,960
 they mean is that they're following the rules. Um, but it does reveal that there is a another bid

151
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:04,480
 for 2023, which is Winnipeg. Um, Winnipeg is a place in Canada, uh, and it is neither Memphis,

152
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,920
 nor Chengdu. So how do we feel about Winnipeg peeps? Yeah, I think it's a bit difficult because it's

153
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,840
 it's obvious that what we were all taking as a sort of hypothetical argument with, you know,

154
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,000
 actual ramifications, um, you know, was, was not as Jonathan puts it, constitutional

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,760
 predatory, but one was practical implications, which we didn't know two weeks ago when we were

156
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,400
 recording this. Um, and so that's how we treated it. And now there is an extra bid, and it seems

157
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,760
 like it's worked out in the best possible way, which is there is another bid, and it has been

158
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,360
 allowed to be on the ballot with the other two bids on the basis that it has been filed

159
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,920
 within what the constitution would consider to be the, the filing date. And so that's all,

160
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,480
 all fine as to the bid itself. I think it's unusual to have a bid sort of emerge this close to the

161
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,840
 convention. And I'm not sure if there's any backstory as to why it has emerged sort of this

162
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,840
 close to the time. I mean, it looks like a reasonable bid, but I haven't, I don't know, I don't have

163
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,400
 a lot to say. I haven't looked at it in huge detail. It looks like a bunch of people who've

164
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,800
 run some conventions before are going to run a one in Winnipeg. Winnipeg, uh, looks fine. I think

165
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:23,680
 there's like definitely sort of a minimum standard of world com bid. And it seems to meet that by having

166
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,120
 like a venue and some hotels and a plan and a committee. I mean, I think one of the things

167
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,360
 about the filing requirements for a world con is that they are designed to ensure that a world

168
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,760
 con meets a minimum standard bid. And I think this does meet a minimum standard. Um, I think there

169
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:51,920
 was a lot of pressure for a world con bid that was not either Memphis or Chengdu. And I think that

170
00:14:51,920 --> 00:15:00,480
 this bid has appeared in response to that pressure. Um, I don't think it's, it doesn't feel like the

171
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,360
 best of all possible bids. Um, but I think you can, you can see that there are a lot of people out

172
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,880
 there going, I don't want to go to Chengdu either for good or bad. I mean, I think there are a lot

173
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,440
 of reasons why people don't want to go, don't want the world con going to Chengdu. And some of those

174
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,880
 reasons have some foundation. And some of those reasons have less foundation, but there was certainly

175
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,000
 a lot of pressure for a bid that wasn't Chengdu. And I think that the Memphis bid has just not been

176
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,360
 good enough. It's not been acting like it was contesting a bid that it might lose. And so therefore

177
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,720
 needed to get the word out about what was good and special about it. Um, I think I, I, I talked before

178
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,840
 on this podcast quite a lot about conventions needing to have a reasonably good social media

179
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,360
 game and needing to talk about what they are doing and why and what the, especially bids, but

180
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,280
 conventions generally, why, why you should come to this convention. Um, and I just don't think

181
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,680
 Memphis has done that. And so Winnipeg's seen a gap and filled it. No, and I agree. And I think,

182
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,480
 I think one of the huge symptoms of that is that I can't tell you what the Memphis logo

183
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,360
 looks like. It's Elvis as an alien. It's actually one of the better logos for World Cons.

184
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,080
 I can't tell you what the Memphis logo looks like. I can't tell you who's on the committee. I can't

185
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,240
 tell you any of these things. And I think that is symptomatic of a bid that is not doing enough

186
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,720
 to put itself in front of me and say, look, we're a thing that you need to be thinking about voting

187
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,320
 for. And as someone who is a supporting member of the World Cons, um, like it surprised me that

188
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,200
 that's the case with every previous World Conbid, like the Tricon bid and the, um, uh, New Zealand

189
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,160
 bid and the DC bid, I've, I've been able to conjure up like imagery and associated feelings

190
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,200
 with each of those bids. Memphis, I have no connection to at all. Um, so I think, I think that does

191
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,320
 speak a lot to how badly they've been doing at, um, kind of putting themselves out there and in

192
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,920
 front of people who might vote. And I think this, this Winnipeg bid is a reaction to that. Um, and

193
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,520
 I think we had a little bit of this, uh, with confusion. I think, um, I want to speak a little

194
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,480
 bit on that, which is that I think Memphis did have somebody at confusion. Um, but because

195
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,200
 that meant that they were in the dealer's room and that wasn't, if you weren't in the dealer's

196
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:30,000
 room in gather, you wouldn't see the fan tables. Um, it meant that it was much harder for individuals

197
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,080
 representing things to make their presence felt at confusion than it would have been at a physical

198
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,560
 Eastercon. So I don't think that's entirely Memphis's fault. They did come and represent the

199
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:47,520
 bid at Eastercon. I think in the form of Adam Beaton, I think, but like, I'm sure I saw stuff from DC

200
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,240
 and Conzeland and Troycon on, on, on like social media and stuff. Maybe I'm misremembering. Maybe

201
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,800
 I'm underestimating how much of it I did see at physical conventions and maybe the lack of physical

202
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,480
 conventions for Memphis to advertise at is a kind of mostly what's happening here.

203
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,520
 Maybe Memphis's social media game is not super strong. I have been to a couple of Memphis parties

204
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,600
 at World Cons and other cons, which I have enjoyed. So they definitely like had some ground game,

205
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,760
 but yeah, I think maybe they just don't have, they don't do a lot of, Memphis maybe just don't

206
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,400
 do a lot of tweeting. They don't do a lot to try to kind of get things out there. I mean, I think

207
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,720
 if you compare them to like, uh, the one I think which is going incredibly strongly, um, and I

208
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,640
 realize Alice in his involvement in this, but I think Glasgow in 2024, you can see them putting

209
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,520
 themselves out there at conventions. They've run, they've been running virtual events. They've been,

210
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,480
 you know, they have some incredibly strong artwork as well to use to promote themselves. I think

211
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,680
 that, that kind of thing is really just plants yourselves and people's memories in a way that,

212
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,040
 to be honest, Memphis has failed to do. Um, I'm going to give them a bit of a pass because, um,

213
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,440
 you know, it has been a hard year and everyone, um, has different abilities to do things during

214
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,880
 the past year. But I think they're also kind of ending up being the sort of the, um, people are

215
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,800
 not so much voting for Memphis in all cases as voting for not Chengdu. I think that does end up

216
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,080
 hurting them because it ends up that all the discussion ends up being about Chengdu and like,

217
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,280
 why people think they should be a World Con in Chengdu and also the many people who think we

218
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,520
 shouldn't have a World Con in Chengdu rather than ending up discussing whether we actually think

219
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,080
 Memphis would be a better bid. I will say that the one thing about Winnipeg is they do have a big

220
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,920
 committee but they actually, they don't have a full kind of code of conduct and things on their

221
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,400
 website yet. And I think even if you are doing a very speedy bid, it's good to get up and running

222
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,840
 with a code of conduct. They're from the start. Yeah, they, they literally have the stuff you

223
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,760
 have to file and nothing else and I'm going to give them a pass for the moment but they need to

224
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,440
 get that sorted. I guess they have a lot longer now to ramp up because I keep forgetting the

225
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,120
 that they do not have until August ramp up. They don't have until December.

226
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,960
 They do also have a page on their website that outlines their commitment to diversity in the

227
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,200
 code of conduct gives an example code of conduct that they might piece their code of conduct on

228
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,840
 and says that they're working on it with a specific person who is in charge of that effort.

229
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,880
 So I don't think it's that they haven't thought about it. I will say Winnipeg is chaired by Terry

230
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,000
 Fong and if that name sounds familiar to you, Terry was the co-chair of the Montreal 2017 bid

231
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,600
 and I will note that I can't, I can't check whether I'm friends with the people on the Memphis

232
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,680
 in 23 committee because as far as I could tell, their website doesn't have the committee on it.

233
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,760
 Had a very smuffy conversation a few days ago where we were talking about the World Convids.

234
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:47,120
 So, so one of the smuffy people said maybe the chairs or maybe some of the other people involved

235
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,840
 in Memphis were concerned about having full lists of staff online because they had experienced

236
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,800
 harassment online in the past and felt that having their staff listed on the website

237
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,880
 made harassment of that kind easier and I have quite a lot of sympathy with that. We have we have

238
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,720
 quite a few con runners in Britain who have been while running conventions and have decided not to

239
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,280
 do it again as a result but I think if you're not going to have your full staff online, I think

240
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,720
 you probably need to have something saying why you haven't put your full staff online.

241
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,400
 There's a huge difference between having a committee page that says here is the chair we have decided

242
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,800
 not to list the rest of our committee because we are concerned about harassment and then I would

243
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,520
 have read that and been like oh that's a really good point and like they've thought about it and

244
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,280
 it's not just that they haven't done it but because they haven't got that page it just looks like

245
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,840
 they're not doing a very good job and that is tough because it might not be the case but like

246
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,480
 keep going back to this people don't know how to communicate like just think about the messages

247
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,520
 you're sending and like just if you if there is a reason you've done a thing tell people the reason

248
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,040
 that you've done the thing and explain what the thing was it's that easy like people usually want

249
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,920
 to understand where you are coming from especially if you're running an event as part of a community

250
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,880
 like in the UK so if you're having trouble with social media talk about it if you're having trouble

251
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,480
 like listing your community because you've got concerns about harassment talk about it talk about

252
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,280
 these things with the people in your community and then the community will be there for you and

253
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,480
 we'll we're having these discussions don't don't shun it all to back chat and like have it all like

254
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,320
 be gossip that doesn't help anyway I know I'm I know I'm silly and like not thinking through the

255
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,320
 ramifications but it just it frustrates me because yeah it's not I'm looking forward to seeing all

256
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,840
 three of the bids ramp up as we come to the vote um I was just going to say two things one is that

257
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,880
 as you mentioned some of the bid committee for Winnipeg in 23 were also part of the committee

258
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,360
 bidding for Montreal in 2017 so that they're clearly used to being basically the third bid

259
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,520
 come into a into a contested field so it's not a new situation for them so hopefully they did take

260
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,720
 something from what I think was quite an unfortunate situation in 2017 where you did sort of have

261
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,880
 this thing where it was almost like the US versus Europe are we going to have this big chunk of

262
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,080
 European world comes in a row and people were very unsure about that and then we ended up basically

263
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,600
 with a sort of two horse race and I think Montreal and Japan a distant third and fourth

264
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:28,240
 um but it's clearly like experience they have and so they'll now be I'm sure thinking about how to

265
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,600
 up their game for this next bid I was also going to say I quite like their sort of retro spacey logo

266
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,280
 I really like I really like the Winnipeg really like the Winnipeg logo I think it's really cool

267
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,160
 um and uh yeah the the website has an awful lot more on it than the Memphis website which is

268
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,400
 quite impressive given that Winnipeg arose in the last two weeks and Memphis has had years uh to

269
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,840
 get their stuff together. There's also one next thing I wanted to say which is I looked through the um

270
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:04,240
 I looked through all their bid documents and I have never been to Canada but the Winnipeg tourism

271
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,760
 documents they have are just like so enthusiastic about please come to Winnipeg which is essentially

272
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,400
 this place in Canada that is probably like fifth or sixth of your list of places in Canada you

273
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:25,040
 might ever think going to um way way way lower than that way way I'm being very nice

274
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:33,040
 and it just just feeling it's nice. Well so so um Kevin Kevin said there's an interesting

275
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,600
 there's an interesting blog post I think it's on a blog that Kevin Sander wrote so maybe it's on his

276
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,440
 dream with um I will try and find it to put in the show notes listeners um but they basically wrote

277
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,480
 a thing which says you can't when you're planning a Canadian WorldCon and you know that Seattle

278
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,400
 are bidding for the WorldCon two years after there were rules in the Worcester Constitution

279
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,360
 which mean that you can't bid a city if it's within a certain distance of the of the host

280
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,000
 WorldCon that which site selection will occur and so they couldn't for instance pick Vancouver

281
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,440
 because that would have meant Seattle had to fold and so this was a very careful balancing act of

282
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,800
 not wanting to automatically lose the Pacific Northwest fandom entirely and so I think I think

283
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,080
 there are considerations here along those lines. I do not personally go to WorldCons because I want

284
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:32,480
 to holiday in the city I am sure that Winnipeg contains as every host city does contains enough to

285
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,320
 entertain me around a WorldCon that it'll be fine and um as does of course Memphis as does Chengdu

286
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,920
 but there's there's a huge benefit to having a tourist board who absolutely loves you and wants

287
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:52,800
 you to be there because if you are in a city that is a major tourist destination you are that a

288
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,840
 WorldCon is fairly small beans but if you are the big thing that's going to happen in Winnipeg that

289
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,720
 yeah um it's going to be very cool and they will look after us I'm sure. No I will say I used to go

290
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,680
 to WorldCons and I used to be like oh it's in a city I really want to go to and then having now

291
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,280
 been to five or six WorldCons I'm like oh I don't see the city like I see the restaurants in the city so

292
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,600
 that if they've got good restaurants that's nice. A WorldCon is an expensive proposition and to do

293
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,240
 tourism on either side means you have to spend for a week of extra hotel which is not a cheap

294
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,240
 proposition and I have not yet achieved the wealth privilege I need for that to be a situation in

295
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,600
 which I am in. I'm sure lots of WorldCon fans are in a situation for whom that makes sense but

296
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,200
 like I've never I've never felt like I can really. I think that's interesting because I am more of

297
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,000
 the mind that actually I will probably go to fewer WorldCons but do more tourism around them because

298
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,560
 that seems like a more kind of more economical and you know marginally more environmentally friendly

299
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,560
 option. It depends what your aim I don't go I go to WorldCons to see lots of people I like

300
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,360
 and once all the people I like I like have left the city staying there. We've had this we've litigated

301
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,880
 this in previous episodes but I think I think it is clear that for me conventions are my focus in

302
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,080
 convention going is much more social than it is for you I think Liz and so it doesn't surprise me that

303
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,120
 that I if I prioritize going to more WorldCons to get that and prioritizing the social experience

304
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,200
 at those WorldCons that doesn't seem out of character with like our attitudes to conventions

305
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,960
 is that I hope I'm not being super I'm really worried I'm being super harsh I don't intend to

306
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,360
 be super harsh do you think that's fair or do you think I'm off base? I think I think it's a bit harsh

307
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,440
 but I think the issue is that I would even if I had unlimited wealth and holiday I would probably

308
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,080
 never go to every single WorldCon. Oh no I definitely would. Yeah I know 100%

309
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:57,200
 yeah no I live like like an 18 hour flight from the US right now it is a big thing yeah I might

310
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,920
 actually I would go to a foreign convention each year saving the planet not being a not being a

311
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,680
 preventer for that so it wouldn't necessarily be work on but I do like WorldCons a lot. If I had

312
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:16,320
 unlimited money and the ability to travel without causing climate change you know but but I have a

313
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,880
 point about shoulder days for WorldCons that is new and we haven't talked about before and I really

314
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,600
 want to talk about which is that if you go for a couple of weeks with a WorldCon in the middle

315
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,360
 or even more than a couple of weeks you do actually get to have those social events around the WorldCon

316
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,000
 with a fairly random set of people who are also doing this plus the people who live in the city

317
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,760
 and you get to do it in a much more relaxed way because I find WorldCons themselves to be quite

318
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:49,600
 frenetic so you know for Helsinki we flew up to the Arctic Circle after the WorldCon and we met

319
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,720
 numerous fans who we had not previously met who were also in Rovid Yemi and you could tell because

320
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,040
 they were the only tourists in the Arctic Circle in August because you know it's not a sensible place

321
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,280
 to go really but it was really nice meeting fans in an environment that really wasn't connected

322
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,760
 to the WorldCon at all and was a little bit I've talked a lot before about randomicity that one

323
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,880
 of the things I like about fandom is that you have random conversations not just ones with people

324
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,320
 you know very well already. It's a good point because one of my favorite conventions was

325
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,480
 Shamrakhan and that was like a similar thing where it was like all the same people but after the World

326
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:36,160
Con and Waychiller so I'm definitely I guess I'm kind of not giving enough credit to how nice it can be

327
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,360
 to go to like associated events before and afterwards but again that's not I don't think I'm coming

328
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:48,400
 out that from the tourism angle I mean but then you know the I mean I think part of the other

329
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,280
 thing is that although I love traveling I also quite like my house and like my creature comforts so

330
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,600
 being away for longer I find more disruptive but maybe that I don't know I don't know there's

331
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,240
 probably a lot of different it might be this is quite complicated and like we all have slightly

332
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,240
 different relationships with it yeah which is why we do a podcast and normally we can talk to

333
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,440
 each other during the podcast rather than monologuing in three separate places well that's not let's

334
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,160
 not get carried away for the listener who is wondering why we might be more monologuing than usual my

335
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,920
 internet is not happy with me today I don't know why I don't know why I did to offend the internet

336
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:33,360
 gods something that we forgot to say when we were reading Jonathan's log is that when Kevin made his

337
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:40,640
 point about the Wussfuss constitution and the requirements it has for bid deadlines he was

338
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,760
 clearly doing so because he knew about the Winnipeg bid because he is a the Wussfuss advisor to the

339
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,560
 Winnipeg bid and he is on their webpage but he didn't mention that and I think it would have

340
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,840
 changed the conversation quite a lot if he had just said here is all the information I have here

341
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,120
 is what I think here is what has led me to say it and and here is why it's important and then we

342
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,400
 could have an conversation with all of the information which would have been more informed and I kind

343
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:18,800
 of appreciate that he has stated this is a constitutional problem because there is there is an argument

344
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,360
 that it's important to treat this as a constitutional problem rather than as a but there is this bid

345
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,760
 that needs to file because you know it is an important point even if there isn't a bid but I

346
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,200
 will say a reaction to that it doesn't look a whole like Kevin decided that this was a problem he

347
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,280
 wanted to highlight until there was a reason that it needed highlighting and so I kind of think that's

348
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,160
 a little bit disingenuous on his part to be like I expect everyone else to consider this in isolation

349
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,320
 from the principle of the thing but the reason I am bringing it up is not for those reasons and

350
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,120
 I think you know again just less secrecy just tell people what you're saying and why you're saying

351
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,560
 it and then everyone can chat and it's just so much easier I think you're right that they could have

352
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,440
 been more open because let's face it the question of like when the site selection deadline and what

353
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:13,040
 the risk of this constitution says is pretty inside baseball for Worldcon fans and I find it hard to

354
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:19,200
 believe that the Winnipeg bid has been so stealthy that a bunch of people didn't already know about

355
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,720
 it anyway so there's a lot of people discussing this probably were also aware of the subtext and

356
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,240
 then there'd be a bunch of people like us who were sort of just outside those circles who were not

357
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,880
 aware of the subtext and yeah then yeah I'm just like yeah you may as well say look I know there's

358
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,320
 another bid in the works and they they would like to bid for it and they'd like to be fiddly on the

359
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,440
 bid rather than kind of doing this here is my hypothetical question and two weeks later it will

360
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,400
 be revealed that it was not very hypothetical I want to make the point that I made to John when he

361
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:56,640
 raised this in conversation which is that Winnipeg was accepted because it was known con runners doing

362
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:05,040
 it and they had done all the things but it is not obvious to me that a bid that did not have those

363
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:11,600
 qualities would have been given the discretion of disc on and things like that should not be

364
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,760
 discretion of disc on they should be yes yeah that there should be there should be a procedure

365
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,680
 and rules and there were so I am kind of on Kevin's side a bit no and I think you're right I think

366
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:29,040
 if I was Kevin I would have said here is a thing there are two reasons this is important one is

367
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,840
 the principle and the fact that we can't be seen to allow our mates to file past the deadline

368
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,760
 when we might not allow people who are not known to us to do the same but secondly there is this

369
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,880
 bid so there is also a practical component to this problem because then you can have the discussion

370
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,160
 of like there's a principle there's a practical reason it's important that we don't make the

371
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,720
 decision based purely on the practical reason because that would be potentially

372
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,440
 it would potentially be gatekeeping in a way so but I do take the point and I think that is

373
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,400
 probably what I think that was probably the reason Kevin did it in this order I'm just skeptical

374
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,400
 that that was the best way to do it from the perspective of the wider conversation especially

375
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,400
 when you do a podcast that comes out every two weeks and by the time the episode dropped

376
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,880
 with a bigger announced by the time we recorded they hadn't very unhelpful if everyone could

377
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,920
 just make sure that they make big news announcements in line with octa thought recording schedules

378
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,240
 that would be that would be good yeah I think we should put a change to that effect in the

379
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,720
 wussfuss constitution John I think you could solve this problem if you just edited octa thought

380
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:40,080
 overnight and released it the next day then we would never be scooped anyway it's been a good run

381
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,680
 31 episodes five hours so fast the year I think we're about to come up on the second year of

382
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:51,520
 billing so it's a good time to decide to stop anyway it was lovely uh lovely podcasting with you both

383
00:34:51,520 --> 00:35:04,720
 in other news oh I think Winnipeg was being kept quite close to its chest I think though

384
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,640
 there were probably more people in the know than we know but but plenty of people were not

385
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,440
 were surprised by it and it's clear that that was partly because they wanted to

386
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,960
 not announce it not like anyone know it was happening until it was a fully formed properly

387
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,200
 filed with all its bits together bid and we've talked before on this podcast about how

388
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,520
 the benefits the virtues of surprise are not perhaps as great as the people who are

389
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,480
 pulling the surprise together think they are and I think this may be one of those cases as well

390
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,960
 that that surprise that's a new bid well yeah what what did you get out of that much real

391
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,080
 I don't think you got anything out of that I mean they they certainly didn't get you knowing

392
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,600
 what their host city was so that that is an important point

393
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,840
 and get more drill what did you get out of that Winnipeg

394
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:02,240
 I actually recorded the pickup for you you didn't need to just it was just a simple slip

395
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,920
 of the tug you don't need to put it everything I say no but I was stupid

396
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,640
 that's going in the episode

397
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,720
 oh but that that's like at least 50% of my enjoyment of the podcast so

398
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:24,320
 Alison says stupid things because she's old her her disability and age and not reflect

399
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,960
 and not appreciated by her younger co-hosts oh it's not I also sometimes flood my lines

400
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,400
 uh uh listen as it tells me to say that in the script you'll be having to know

401
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,640
 I've got a good takeaway can I do a good takeaway oh yes to it to please yes

402
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,880
 speaking of conventions where we fail to run them very stealthily at all before we announce them

403
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:54,960
 we're doing punctuation too yeah hey yes so if you are thinking surely they already announced

404
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:03,760
 punctuation too yeah we're really bad at secrets listeners uh but you can join today for 0.5 or 10

405
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,960
 pounds we don't mind which and we actually do have a official line on this which is that punctuation

406
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,160
 to cost a fiver and if that's a problem for you then pay us nothing and you can join and if you'd

407
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,640
 like to give us more support um pay us a tenor that's all great and all these memberships are

408
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:26,480
 exactly the same yes um to the point where obviously in the uh obviously in the conridge.org um csv

409
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,600
 it does tell us um how much you paid but in the database we're actually looking at doesn't

410
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,360
 so it really is yeah the the treasury the treasury knows because we have to make numbers add up

411
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:44,720
 but otherwise it's nobody knows yes we're doing punctuation too a a we've already talked about

412
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:54,000
 it a little bit um but we're excited we currently have drum roll please 81 members

413
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:03,120
 punctuation one had 200 members um so we're almost halfway to our previous um total we have

414
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,000
 62 people in the UK four in Ireland four in Australia three in the USA two in the Netherlands one in

415
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,280
 Germany sorry two in Germany one in Thailand one in Poland one in Canada and one in Sweden uh

416
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,560
 that adds up to 81 listeners so we've made some changes this time uh you can pay without

417
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,320
 subscribing to a WordPress website uh for some reason so that's good there's a discord we have

418
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,160
 launched a non-biding consultative referendum so if you have thoughts on what platforms we use to

419
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,320
 get our program content to your eyes and ears please fill that in because we are keen to understand

420
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,280
 what people like and what people don't like about two options that we are mulling over for our

421
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:49,120
 program delivery method and we're also keen to speak to people who are people who use

422
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,000
 subtitling uh because we would like to try and implement some subtitling if we have the budget

423
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,560
 and we'd be keen to understand how people use subtitling and what they would find useful

424
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,080
 and also please fill in if you'd like to volunteer fill in the volunteering form uh I will put links

425
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:10,000
 to all of these things in the show notes the volunteering form is also a good way to tell us

426
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,480
 about program items you would like to see even if you would not necessarily like to be on those

427
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,360
 items so please come and tell us what you would like to see and we will do our best to come up with

428
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:27,520
 an entertaining program full of things you want to see yay we've already got one program item no

429
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,800
 two program items are they the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony job we've already got

430
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,160
 and the beer tasting seven program items in place so get your program ideas and include

431
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,080
 the fan fun fortune in that oh no eight program ideas already in place look all i'm saying is get

432
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:53,040
 your program items in now because we are we are programmed to the gills people like for a convention

433
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,400
 that doesn't really have a program list yet we have we have come up with a lot of ideas

434
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,440
 most of them it should be admitted by virtue of looking at the punctuation one program and saying

435
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,720
 yeah we could do that again yeah no join it's good it's going to be good um yeah you're very

436
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:16,000
 encouraged um yes tell all your friends yes definitely um especially tell your friends who do

437
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,160
 interesting things and would like to come and do them at punctuation because that'll be cool

438
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,800
 i think we would like to maintain roughly the same program balance we had at punctuation one

439
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,720
 which is we had some serious and interesting and thoughtful discussions and talks and also

440
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,840
 some fun stuff and some things that are just of general interest fans and also we're quite happy

441
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:43,440
 to have interactive items and workshops and ways of getting people engaged over zoom or over other

442
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,880
 platforms so basically anything along any of those lines that you would be interested in put them

443
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,960
 in our form otherwise i'll have to come up with them all and then the program will be of interest

444
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,800
 entirely to me so yeah it got an incentive i am particularly i'm hoping the convention will be a

445
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,920
 little bit bigger this time though we are arguing in committee about exactly how large that might be

446
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,320
 but if it's bigger we may need slightly more program so that's a thing and i would like to have

447
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:14,480
 more things that involve people getting outside into the fresh air as we will be in june and you

448
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,840
 might not want to be stuck in your house all weekend so if you think about ways in which people can

449
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,880
 engage online whilst also engaging with their local community that will be a good idea as well

450
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:32,160
 sitting on video all the time is not necessarily the best thing for uh well being and that's why

451
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,920
 we record oct thought entirely in the garden speaking as somebody who's just about 23 hours a day on

452
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,320
 video for a year

453
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,400
 there is a facebook group called joth uh joth is a place for comrunners to go which is less

454
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,960
 clique than smoth and so to really emphasize that they gave it a similarly impenetratable acronym

455
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,680
 that doesn't make any sense unless you know the in-joke it stands for journeyman of fandom and that

456
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,120
 comes from uh masquerade where the journeyman category is one step below the master category

457
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,960
 and so smoth becomes joth secret master of fandom to journeyman of fandom haraa inclusivity

458
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,960
 it's a facebook group uh it's it's basically the smoth's list but on facebook instead of on email

459
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,720
 and perhaps a little bit more positive actually perhaps a lot more positive

460
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,080
 perhaps a great deal more positive um and it's a really good place to have discussions

461
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:34,160
 it's it is um it's much broader group i think it's probably the world's largest

462
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,840
 con-running group that is focused on fan run conventions and it includes enormous numbers of

463
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:48,320
 different sorts of conventions so you'll find people who are running small anime conventions in

464
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:54,960
 pig f*ck Nebraska on joth i think you'll find it's it's it's pronounced pig-fook

465
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,720
 liz listeners liz if anyone came to autofop live and saw liz's reaction to my pun

466
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,200
 the i laugh very hard at imagine liz has made that face and then you have you have liz i think

467
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,280
 it's a bit rude about nebraska but i'd be far out of love into nebraska so

468
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:19,200
 i'm sure nebraskas lovely i've i would love to go nebraskan listeners please invite us to your

469
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,360
 homes once we're all back vaccinated no but in in all seriousness um joth is a fantastic community

470
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,240
 and is a fantastically to go if you're interested at all in con-running and is a super friendly bunch

471
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:37,120
 of people and allyson has been reading it yeah it's a super friendly bunch of people as a rule

472
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:42,160
 but that doesn't mean every single one of them is super friendly and it has recently been it has

473
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,160
 had a pair of discussions one is um what what is wrong with the wollcon which is such a large

474
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,200
 topic that you could podcast about it every fortnight for a year and not still not scratch the

475
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,000
 surface of things that you can say and the other one of which is tell us all the great things about

476
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,040
 wollcon and then there are some sort kind of sub threads about what should wollcons and other

477
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,560
 large conventions be doing to improve their inclusivity and they have just explored a vast number of

478
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,560
 things but one of the things that has happened in that is that some people say traditional fans are

479
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:23,520
 not welcoming enough of new fans and their their needs and the traditional fans some of them go

480
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,680
 but we all welcoming look at all this stuff we do and don't necessarily bridge the gap and some

481
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,960
 of the other ones go oh no really you can't be a proper fan unless you've read the enchanted

482
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,680
 duplicator here i'll link to it and this is it okay i may be exaggerating slightly but not very much

483
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,280
 and i wanted to talk about the business meeting which is that the one of the ways in which

484
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,920
 wollcons are incredibly uninclusive is that they say ah if you really want to change the way things

485
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:59,360
 are done the solution is to spend many months immersing yourself in wuswis manushi i and then

486
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,960
 spend your wollcon which you've traveled halfway around the world to attend and it's all of your

487
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,680
 holiday money for three years um i'm just talking about myself for other people it might be all

488
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,000
 of their holiday money for five years or all of their holiday money for six months you know people

489
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 vary but you've spent a very considerable outlay of time and energy to get to you want to spend that

490
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,320
 weekend in a business meeting and that seems like an unreasonable ask to me and that is one of the

491
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,440
 reasons why wuswiswis changes much more slowly than the wollcon in general and here is my

492
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,320
 small suggestion which is that we take the wuswiswis business meeting out of the wollcon and we put

493
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,600
 it on a different weekend and we put it online and we open it up to everyone who is a supporting

494
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:50,080
 member of the current or future seated wollcons or the immediate past previous wollcon and um i

495
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,280
 don't want to do this myself so i'd like some wuswis nerds to agree with me please

496
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:00,560
 but i wanted to say it to doctor thought so that wuswis nerds might start thinking about this

497
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,400
 yeah so i have thoughts about the wuswis business meeting here are my thoughts i appreciate that

498
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,520
 there are a lot of people um i don't i don't know it's i don't think it's a majority of the

499
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,680
 membership of any given wollcon but there is even a lot of people for whom the wuswis business

500
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,480
 meeting is a highlight of their wollcon and they really enjoy going to the wiswis meeting and um

501
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:30,080
 and i'm aware that the things i'm about to say might make the wollcon worse for those people

502
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,240
 because um if you separate the wiswis meeting with the wollcon and the business meeting is one of

503
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,240
 your favorite parts of the wollcon you're going to have a wuswollcon and that's hard

504
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,960
 and i'm aware and i don't i'm aware of that i say all of this being aware that this is one of the

505
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:53,040
 side effects of my proposal having said that i think i would argue that effective and fair governance

506
00:46:53,040 --> 00:47:00,000
 of wiswis is more important than the enjoyment of those people at the business meeting at wollcon

507
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,240
 i think if the way the business meeting is structured at the moment disenfranchises people who do not

508
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:13,760
 find the business meeting enjoyable that is a problem and i think if it disenfranchises people who

509
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:20,720
 have spent a higher percentage of their yearly holiday budget ongoing to wollcon say the five

510
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,880
 year people in turn of the six months people i think those people are less likely to want to spend

511
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,720
 that time at the business meeting and so i think it inadvertently also hugely privileges the wealthy

512
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:36,000
 to involvement in the governance of wollcon which i feel is a huge problem and so i completely

513
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,920
 agree with what alison has just said i feel quite strongly that the business meeting should not be

514
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,040
 at the wollcon and i think that it made a lot of sense in a world where we couldn't do this stuff

515
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:54,800
 online but now we can and i feel like we can uh we can i think assume that anyone who can afford

516
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:01,120
 to go to a wollcon can also afford to have internet for one weekend a year and maybe that's unfair

517
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,600
 and privileged of me but i i think that's a reasonable perspective if it's not please write in

518
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:12,320
 as someone who can only attend the wollcon occasionally i've been in fandom since 1984

519
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,480
 1983 so that's about that's more years than i care to think about and i've doubled in with my

520
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,720
 tenth wollcon so i think one year in three is not a bad representation of that the the wuss

521
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,080
 was business meeting has gone to some lengths to get its self put on to get itself available online

522
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:37,760
 to view when it's a physical event and i do watch it religiously when i don't go to the wollcon but i

523
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,800
 can't what i can't get to it when i'm am at the wollcon because i'm not the wollcon so i would i

524
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,000
 think this is a change that's time whose time has come my thoughts on the wollcon business meeting i

525
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 have done on several podcasts in the past and i'm not going to repeat them because that will also

526
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,440
 bore the pants of people who are listening to our back catalogue right now but i would say two things

527
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,200
 one is that i think uh something that's becoming evident from a lot of sort of meetings and conferences

528
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:13,280
 i go to is that sometimes having people kind of ask questions by text chat during remote meetings

529
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,160
 actually works really well because you can see who is also going to make the same point as you

530
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,960
 and you can upvote them or you can agree with them and it seems to work really nicely basically for

531
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,240
 having a bit of discussion going on and i wonder if there are opportunities for things like that

532
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,440
 which could be seized at this sort of virtual business meeting

533
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:40,560
 that we are not at the moment i i realize that this is basically impossible to do well i assume

534
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,440
 it is impossible to do under Roberts Rules of Order i don't know because every time i think about

535
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,720
 looking at Roberts Rules of Order uh my eyes glaze over and i follow suit i also did have a thought

536
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,760
 that maybe we should try using Roberts Rules of Order on the podcast in order that we all get a

537
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:03,920
 word in edgeways maybe that would improve thoughts i think to be fair like if me and

538
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,960
 allison just did some breathing exercises beforehand that might also help uh maybe that certainly from

539
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,560
 my perspective i feel if you feel that Roberts Rules of Order is being used at the wuss for

540
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,400
 business meeting to allow the quieter and less privilege to get a word in edgeways you are very

541
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,000
 wrong about that that was almost a tightly joke i also do not feel that i am the quiet and under

542
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,240
 privilege role on this podcast i feel i am more of the long suffering one on this podcast that's my

543
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:40,480
 role it cut that out i feel like oh hang on i'm not going to i'm going to put it in i didn't actually

544
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,280
 include the bit about i think Roberts Rules of Order does not help there are people in wuss first

545
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,960
 whose job it is to explain how wuss first works to people who are not used to wuss first and they

546
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:59,120
 are seen as people who do a good job of um bringing people into wuss first and making it accessible

547
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:04,880
 but i would argue that if you are a group of people that has instituted a method for discussion

548
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:12,080
 which is so impenetrable it needs a guide then volunteering to be that guide does not mean you're

549
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:18,400
 part of the solution it's a bit like if i set fire to allison and then offered to put her out i would

550
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:25,200
 still be the person that set fire to allison and me offering to put her out again would not make

551
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:33,760
 me the good guy i i may disagree with you here because i think it is it is a town meeting democracy

552
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:41,760
 and if you're going to do it that way you probably do need a set of rules of order to do it with

553
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:50,720
 and i am not convinced that switching switching sets would necessarily solve the problem so i mean

554
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,080
 i i do think it's they are more bureaucratic than they need to be anyway and it does need to be much

555
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,800
 easier for people but i think actually making it a much making it over a weekend so there was time

556
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,840
 for people to have much more elaborate discussions all things and then have a main have cleaneries

557
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,360
 that bring things back to plenary i think would just make it much better it would be a much better

558
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,160
 event and people and it would be very nerdy but you could then just come along because you knew that

559
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,000
 the particular thing you're interested in will be being talked about at three o'clock on friday

560
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,600
 or whatever and it would just be so much better i actually thought the podcast where we nerd out

561
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:33,040
 about was for 25 minutes while everyone cries it's a very world connie podcast in it it wasn't

562
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,960
 going to be and then it was um but you know these things happen

563
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,560
 [Music]

564
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,400
 so i'm just going to say marx later said everyone should stop what they're doing and watch the

565
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,960
 mitchell's versus the machines which is a an animated movie about a family who saved the world from

566
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,160
 robots and um and we watched last night and it's pretty good so it will amuse you for one hour and

567
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:04,080
 54 minutes and that is my ox thought recommendation for popular culture for you to do in the next week

568
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,760
 i think everyone should i think we should institute this what should we do what should we do next

569
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,360
 week to amuse ourselves this and john what should i what should i listen us do to amuse themselves

570
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:20,400
 for two hours or less read a book uh you should read "Do Transition Baby" by tori peters um which is

571
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,720
 one of the i think the women's prize nominees this year and it's very good it's sort of a

572
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,520
 uh a comedy of manners uh and now i'm on the spot and now i don't know how to describe it anyway

573
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,520
 you should go and read obviously with that you should go and read "Do Transition Baby" by tori peters

574
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,160
 and i'll put a link in the show notes because i really enjoyed it i just finished reading a

575
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,160
 wizard's guide to defensive baking by teaking fisher which is the pen name of Ursula Vernon it is

576
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:53,200
 on the hugo ballots i thoroughly enjoyed it it might take slightly more than two hours uh to read

577
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,360
 i don't know how long it took me me to read uh but i really enjoyed it so that would be my

578
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:02,240
 recommendation for the week oh and taskmaster if you haven't watched taskmaster go and watch taskmaster

579
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,800
 all of it now you can do that in under a week i think you got two weeks till the next one you've

580
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:12,160
 got two weeks to watch all of taskmaster yeah go for it that was the octa thought podcast and it's

581
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:30,880
 goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

582
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:41,760
 Memphis' logo which i think is actually a pretty good logo now i've seen it it's really good

583
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:48,880
 and does not suffer from the does not suffer from the rocket ship phallic rocket ship issue that so

584
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:56,400
 many work on logos no true um but i thought when you were talking about the um how good

585
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:04,240
 Glasgow in 2024's branding is you might have linked to the Star Wars day version of the Glasgow

586
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,240
 in 2024 logo because that's really cool i'm not sure i saw that change in 2023 also have a funky

587
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:16,560
 panda logo as of course they would mmm if someone could post if someone could link to the Star Wars

588
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:21,040
 Glasgow logo that would also be very good because i was like i said i didn't think i've seen it okay

589
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:27,440
 i've put a link to twitter that's got the amazing Glasgow Star Wars day logo in it so you can look

590
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:35,200
 at it down go oh that's amazing yeah so Glasgow very good branding seraphelics um seraphelics is

591
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:42,320
 um i don't know i am i should disclaim that the fact that i am working on the

592
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:50,720
 um Glasgow in 2024 bid but the but seraphelics is fan art is amazing and she is also a finalist in

593
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:58,240
 fan artist Hugo and as far as i'm concerned her work is really exemplifies what i think fan art

594
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:06,400
 should be like which is that it is it surrounds and is of the fan activity that it is being done for

595
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:13,520
 it surrounds us and penetrates us it binds the fan act together can probably talk about this we

596
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,280
 should talk about fan art and what fan art is some other time but um i think it's very good logo

597
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:25,840
 and i think her other work for Glasgow has been very good it is my second favorite seraphelics logo

598
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:34,480
 after after the lulzine logo but i am biased oh did she do the lulzine logo yeah you are very biased

599
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:40,160
 she did i am very biased i can't even remember what the lulzine logos like that i feel very guilty

600
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:47,360
 imagine a beautiful piece of seraphelics art with word lulzine written on it i mean when you have

601
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:53,280
 beautiful art i sort of feel like less is more in a way with stuff that you put on top of the

602
00:56:53,280 --> 00:57:00,720
 vu didn't i do a logo for you once john yeah yep retweet for a fancy and you never actually did

603
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:07,520
 no i did it just not basically it was in the house in days where twitter was still something

604
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:14,480
 you could read all of uh which as it turns out is less true these days um oh yeah or would want to
