 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 96th episode of OctaThorp, a podcast for

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,200
 Science Fiction and Science Fiction Poundome, which is coming to you on the 9th of November

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,160
 2023. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,720
 So Chengdu was a shower or was it? But it's definitely past tense because I think today is the last

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,880
 day or is tomorrow the last day. By the time this comes out it's past 10.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,280
 Ah, yeah it's gone. It's closing now. There were lots of very shiny things.

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,560
 Yes, I think if it was there it was probably quite shiny if you were there.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,840
 I get the impression the online aspects were kind of hard to interact with

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,440
 from other people that went past on my socials. I've heard nothing good about them.

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,200
 No, okay. I've heard it's like oh they've they basically learned nothing from all of the

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,960
 experience of doing things online. That's sad. That is, you know. I mean yeah, did either of you

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,720
 do any online stuff or? No, I tried. Oh Liz, Liz tried. Did you? What happened? It didn't work.

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,720
 So you like, I should say that my home internet is broken so I'm on my phone internet at the

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,600
 moment. But my phone internet is really pretty fast as in we are doing a live as a podcaster it.

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,160
 And so you log in and you like pick a little avatar and you should be able to wander around

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,840
 in a full 3D environment and so on. And I did that a bit and then I tried to teleport to the live

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,800
 programming room and I did teleport to live programming room where you get your little avatar

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,000
 sitting in a little chair but then I couldn't actually get any programming to load. So I gave up.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,280
 That's very consistent with reports I've seen. I mean some people have had it working audio only.

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,760
 Some people have had it working audio and video a bit but mostly we've not really had any

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,560
 output from the work on. It's just been reports. We've had reports and the reports have been,

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,760
 well, you know, this is amazing. I mean the report's been amazing. I get the feeling that they

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,600
 only did the online stuff because they kind of felt they should have an online component because

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,960
 we have the last few World Cons and people generally like it if they can get something out of World

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,760
 Cons that they attend remotely. But I think they should really just have ditched it all. Maybe

27
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,680
 just stream the opening and closing and the hue goes on some platform and just not bothered

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,840
 with the rest of it because there wasn't a lot of stuff going on. Some of it was kind of panels

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,840
 being attended remotely by people doing them remotely which I kind of didn't really see the

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,520
 point of. And there wasn't a lot of like items that were interactive between the people online

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,520
 and the people in the audience which is what kind of you want to do to bring people in. So I think

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,760
 honestly they should have just scrapped it and not bothered. I mean they sold attendance to it for

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,360
 like $10 or something or $2 for first World Cons. $10 if it's not your first World Cons.

34
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,680
 So it didn't cost people a lot so they hadn't lost a lot by signing up to it. Like if it

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,880
 was a con where I paid $60 for a virtual membership then I'd be annoyed. But it's kind of like

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,400
 well I'm as well have a go and it didn't really work so I think they should have just skipped it

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,000
 and had a great time in person which it looks like everyone did. So I can only go buy a report

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,520
 of what's coming out. File 770 has a lot of stuff. I think our occasional correspondent

39
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,520
 Sats Culture has been collecting a lot of stuff together. Honestly like the in-person experience

40
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,000
 looks like it's an amazing spectacle and I am kind of sad I wasn't there.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,280
 Yes and I just want to say one thing which is thank you to one man cultural liaison at Sats Culture

42
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,880
 for basically rendering the entire thing interpretable to Western audiences. Like I think without his work

43
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:09,120
 like I would have so much less idea of what was happening and he has been doing a lot. So I will

44
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,560
 just want to call him out and I will say I believe he is eligible for best friend writer in the next

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,720
 Hugo Awards and I for one should be very glad to see him as a finalist because I think he probably

46
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,600
 has earned it. Ooh there are a set of official program photos. Ooh. Instead of just posting the

47
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,120
 links in File 770 they've posted the QR codes but not actually said well these are the links.

48
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,240
 Yeah I think you're from a less QR code using society but yeah I mean the pictures look amazing

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,880
 they're venue. The venue which was yeah the venue was amazing. The Hugo's themselves look amazing

50
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,600
 I'm sad I don't have a panda Hugo. The Hugo's a beautiful yeah I would have liked a panda Hugo that

51
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,200
 would be good. They released just a few days before the convention a promotional video which I

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,120
 kind of linked to and was like well what is this for and people were like well you know they want

53
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:10,160
 to do nice things. It's not a 2D video it's a 3D animation that has taken professionals hundreds

54
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,880
 of hours to do. What's going on here? It does seem like a lot of effort has been put into Chengdu

55
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,720
 and it does surprise me a little bit. I'm not sure I would have deployed the hours where they

56
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,680
 have deployed the hours which is not a criticism so much as an observation like clearly they had a

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,600
 vision and they have it seems like they have executed on that vision. But also we we don't in a way

58
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,480
 know what they got offered. We don't know if they said right we've got a chunk of money and you'll

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,760
 you'll get the spoilers for future episodes but you'll get us at some point discussing a little

60
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,240
 bit more about you know how you best spend your money and your people points at conventions

61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,800
 spoiler for future episode. We don't know if they had a ton of money and they were like shall we put

62
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,880
 a bunch of this money into making a really attractive promotional video or if someone came to them

63
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,720
 and said hey we would love to sponsor your convention by doing you a really great promotional

64
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,160
 video and they were like yeah fantastic. Yeah no that is true that is Dye's Fair. Yes it probably

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,880
 is something like that and you know I'm sure it was played at the com. I'm sure it's played at the

66
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,560
 com and then you get this kind of like great thing for the author. Yeah it was just in English.

67
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,400
 I mean there may be another version of it. Yeah I had very little dialogue at all it's not like it

68
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,880
 was the one with a voice over. You could really easily change that one entirely to a Chinese

69
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,120
 language. Yeah that's probably right. I'm sure it would have been amazing to have been there and of

70
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,680
 course had I not been on my guff trip I probably would have been there so you know it's kind of weird.

71
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,280
 There's so many photos of like school children as well and young people and like kids sitting next

72
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,680
 a panda photos. Oh so many young people. I just can't help but find that just really cool.

73
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,640
 It's not what we see at World Cons usually. And also Nicholas White signing autographs.

74
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,960
 Don't they probably thought she was the science fiction author? Maybe I don't know.

75
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,480
 It's just it's very good. I got us from autograph once and I found that even funnier.

76
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:14,000
 I haven't seen pictures of Nicholas signing autograph. He posted them on the internet somewhere.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,560
 It's supposed to be a bit of one-time. I think he posted autograph. So we don't know if it's plural

78
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,400
 but I think that's just going to be there's not that many people there from outside China and so

79
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,160
 some children are collecting the autographs of every single one like children who go around

80
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,440
 collecting a million ribbons. I will put a link in the show notes listeners so you can you can see

81
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,400
 all of this. Yeah I mean how many people are there from outside China because some of the people I

82
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,760
 was expecting to be are not. I don't know. I genuinely don't. It's hard to tell. I mean I could listen

83
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,000
 off but I reckon I've seen reports from maybe 30 or 40 some of whom are like invited guests on

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,120
 the program some of whom are just fans who are there. I've seen reports of some fans like

85
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,280
 not from the US or UK kind of going there. There's an Indonesian fan there I think.

86
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,480
 There's people there from the Uganda bid. I think there are people there from Saudi Arabia as well.

87
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,440
 Plus the head of wetter workshop. He's gone all the way from the New Zealand.

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,800
 Yeah he probably didn't have quite such a tight timetable New Zealanders me.

89
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:24,720
 I mean that seems bizarre but. We know Gillian Pollack did a online program item I believe

90
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,520
 for Chengdu and I don't know I assume other people did as well. I assume it wasn't just Gillian

91
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,880
 although you know yeah we know it would work. If you are listening and you did please write in

92
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,280
 because it would be very fascinating to hear how those went from the horse's mouth. Yeah well

93
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,080
 what happened to Lucianco in the end? Was he just kind of there and hanging out? No one knows.

94
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,520
 Don't think he's there? Like he seems to have been massively downplayed and yeah I'm not sure

95
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,840
 if he is there but I don't understand why you'd uninvite him without announcing you'd uninvited him.

96
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,640
 I mean it may just have been logistical difficulties and actually maybe he just literally could not

97
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,400
 attend because he cannot get there. I watched some of the replay videos of the opening ceremony which

98
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,520
 are on YouTube which are worth watching and I think there is one where they list all the guests

99
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,680
 and he's not listed as a guest so maybe they just decide they had to drop him because he couldn't make

100
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,560
 it. Maybe maybe yeah fair enough very strange well I mean not very strange but notable.

101
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,040
 So the other thing that people have been posting pictures of is pandas because they've got to see

102
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,600
 pandas what they really check do which is quite good and don't you aren't you really looking

103
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
 forward to the pictures of everyone who goes to Glasgow and takes pictures with the haggis in the

104
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,080
 same way. Oh that'll be adorable. I mean they have to do a bit of work because they actually have to go

105
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,200
 up to Loch Ness and then they have to go and hide out on the mountain with their bait. Yep yep yep

106
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,640
 I'm sure some of them will be up for that because it's not like pandas in like a

107
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,720
 the pandas are in a big preservation thing whereas when they go to Glasgow they're going to have to go

108
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:58,000
 out at twilight into the wild yeah to get there yeah to get pictures of wild haggis so it's a bit

109
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,120
 harder because they're crepposcular they are crepposcular but also I'm just looking forward to the

110
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,560
 Hugo Award rocket base having the tiny haggis mascot on it. Okay so so you heard it at first it's

111
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,120
 gonna be it's gonna be a haggis but because haggis have two long legs and two short legs is everyone

112
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,320
 knows this right? Yeah yeah exactly yeah. So haggis is a lot they're designed for mountains so they have

113
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,960
 two long legs and two short legs so so the the hot because the base is going to be shaped like a

114
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,880
 haggis the the hugos go to be offered a jaunty angle because because the haggis bit lopsided

115
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,560
 but it'll be fine if you put your Hugo on a mountain when you win it or maybe the haggis is running

116
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:44,960
 around the Hugo. Oh or scaling the Hugo they kind of like a series of Esther can you write in and let us

117
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,720
 know when the base design competition starts because I believe we're going to want to submit one yeah

118
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,080
 because we've got one we've got one we've got a plan little talking little ton haggis is going

119
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:11,840
 up side of the Hugo with crampons. Do we want to talk about the business meeting? What happened

120
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,200
 at the business? Hang on no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

121
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:23,520
 badliss. So we didn't have an episode where I could talk about it but there were quite a lot

122
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:32,080
 of amendments on the agenda for Chengdu. I'm just loading them so I can have a look. Where's my

123
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,720
 amendment for all Hugo designs should incorporate a funny animal? Can I have that next year? Yeah so

124
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,400
 there were tons of amendments we don't actually have a report on everything that pasten failed so

125
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,880
 it's I'm going to have to wait to give a full report but according to file 770 they did pass a

126
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,320
 few things they ratified the ones that were up for amendment which is the 0% solution and best

127
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,280
 game and interactive work apparently so yes we'll have a best game Hugo from next year. Good!

128
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:12,160
 And also we will no longer no award a category if it's on a 25% of the total which I think we were

129
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,480
 in favor of. Yes please. So that's pretty good. Was there anything that wasn't ratified Liz?

130
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,600
 So those are only things that were for ratification but then there were things that were like this

131
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,600
 year's business. So there was nothing that passed at Chicago that needed ratifying that wasn't

132
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,720
 ratified. I don't think so because there were only two things that were passed on and they both

133
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,240
 passed. Nice okay cool cool cool. And then there was a bunch of new business some of which appears to

134
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,880
 have passed on some of which I don't know yet because we don't have a report from the

135
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,160
 appropriate business meeting so probably we'll before then but it looks like they've referred

136
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,640
 to committee the one about whether you should be paid for fan casts or whether that should disqualify

137
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,520
 you basically. What is clear is that there's a lot of people who have taken the opportunity to

138
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,600
 propose constitutional amendments because the World Congress in China and this is their year when

139
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,400
 they can propose constitutional amendments and some of them I think do make sense and some of them

140
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,920
 it kind of depends do you think that fan casts should be analogous to fanzine or do you think

141
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,640
 fan cast should be analogous to kind of both fanzine and semi-prozine in terms of its limits of

142
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:27,200
 professionalism? Yeah I think the wussfuss nerds would say that this has been gone over endlessly

143
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,760
 including at the point where the category was developed. Yeah but I don't think you can blame

144
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,040
 people for saying it's weird that fan cast is different from fanzine and we should make them

145
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,240
 the same when kind of all the debate took place 10 years ago at a business meeting they weren't at.

146
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:51,760
 Yeah and also I think this has largely been answered by the fact that escape pod, pod castel and

147
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,400
 writing excuses all got nominated in categories that weren't fan cast and so my argument would be

148
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:05,680
 that the way the hughos have been treating these is very much in the sense of fan cast is the equivalent

149
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,480
 of fanzine and if you are doing a semi-prozine in audio it goes in semi-prozine and if you are

150
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,360
 doing a professional podcast it goes in best related work. So my gut feeling is we should respect

151
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,920
 the voters and codify that in the constitution so that it continues forward and I think that is

152
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,640
 usually my opinion about the hughos. I'm usually of the opinion that if that if the voters are

153
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,600
 treating something in a certain way it should be codified with the very very strong exception

154
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,080
 that I don't think conventions belong on hughos finalist lists and I would be quite happy if

155
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,240
 that never happened ever again. Yeah well it looks like that runs the committee for more discussion

156
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,360
 which actually feels like a sensible way to do it because I think there is some discussion to be

157
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,800
 had there and also you don't want to make it so strict that if your podcast has you know a patreon

158
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,160
 that gets you a couple hundred quid a year that you spend on hosting a microphone like that shouldn't

159
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,360
 automatically make you a semi-professional podcast but as is written maybe you can't get any money

160
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:16,080
 at all. Anyway that is up for discussion they failed to pass one for best young writer this was

161
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:24,080
 a proposal for basically a new category for writers age between 15 and 24 which hasn't been passed on.

162
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,240
 Firstly that's just ageist because people can come to writing a later in life and that is okay

163
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,080
 and secondly we have an award for new writers already we have a sounding yes we have an award for

164
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,880
 new writers and this was specifically you know the person proposed it said it's a try and encourage

165
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
 young writers in their creative endeavors which is fine but they'll do it some other way that's

166
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:52,240
 not a hugho and then the other thing that passed is there were two basically conflicting proposals

167
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,400
 for what you put on site selection ballot and they have passed a slightly more restrictive one

168
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,520
 which basically means you have to have now a postal address and it's mandatory and if you

169
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:12,800
 don't put a postal address in it may be a no preference ballot. Interesting. It doesn't explicitly

170
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,080
 say what a postal address in the other amendment said it should be addressed including at least

171
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,440
 country and province/state but then otherwise left it as is so you wouldn't have to put a full

172
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,360
 postal address in. So I interpret this to mean that site selection will now require people to put

173
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,240
 their full street address on the site selection ballot which is the situation that came up a

174
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,520
 couple of years ago during the vote for Chengdu. I don't know if I have a I think about whether

175
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,360
 I have a strong opinion about that it just seems like fiddling but yeah. I have a fairly strong

176
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,040
 opinion on it which is that it's it's of parochial. It just doesn't take account of the way the

177
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,800
 world works. Lots and lots of people don't have addresses that a street address is including

178
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,600
 incidentally many people who are traditional voters of for the WorldCom because they have

179
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,520
 post office boxes and they aren't going to put their post office boxes they're just thinking that

180
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,240
 their post office boxes are street address which is not they mean post they think postal address.

181
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,680
 But it doesn't specify didn't specify what a postal address is so I assume it can mean

182
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,600
 wherever you would get post. Yeah so the point is that in lots of places you don't get post in the

183
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,680
 way that you think about it if you come from a western world in which post is delivered in the

184
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:32,720
 way it's delivered in Britain right? Yeah no no no no I appreciate that. Lots of places deliver

185
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,080
 post to your name and a bursi at the village shop essentially. But then that would count on the ballot.

186
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,520
 Yeah potentially that would count as a postal address. I think that's an argument you can have later.

187
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,200
 Yeah maybe it would count as the postal address rather than a street address so so some of these

188
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,080
 things have asked for a street address and that is hard because lots of places don't have those lots

189
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,400
 of people don't have those. It did need clarifying because it just said address so it hadn't been

190
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,360
 updated since we invented the email address basically and this has never previously been a problem

191
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,480
 and it has come up as a problem so I agree with clarifying it but I guess you know maybe they need

192
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,600
 to include what is an example of a valid postal address and I so I felt like the one that was just

193
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,800
 like at least put like your country in province in maybe was clarifying that better because then

194
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,840
 you could say okay it's got a province and a country it's an address so I don't know if this will now

195
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,120
 basically leave it to site selection administrators to determine what counts as a valid postal address

196
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,360
 and potentially leave us with more problems but that's the one that passed so there we go.

197
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,080
 I will go on record as saying that if a site selection administrator disqualified a ballot for

198
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,760
 a postal address that is a completely like crombulent like one of those in whatever country the vote

199
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,680
 was for I'd be very angry so we're like if you know if you are a decision where your postal address

200
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,000
 is effectively given to Bertie at the village shop and the site selection administrator got angry

201
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,160
 I'd be like well that's just parochial nonsense. We'll see. I guess my point is it doesn't seem like

202
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,560
 it's solving a problem it just seems like it's being driven by the wussfus nerds need to categorize

203
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:13,520
 and I'm not wholly behind constitutional amendments that I feel are being driven primarily by a

204
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,000
 desire for neatness rather than a desire to actually address problems which but that is a take I guess

205
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,480
 which you go ahead and have your takes done. Oh thanks Liz. I'm happy about Best Game and I

206
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,840
 can nominate things for Best Game. Have you seen Don Eastlake's report on the main business meeting

207
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,440
 from the wussfus business meeting Facebook group? No I don't really go on Facebook very often. No

208
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,320
 not on the wussfus business meeting group. Right so that's included independent films has moved

209
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,680
 up the agenda amended to add sun setting and past. Oh god yes yes this is what I was getting to

210
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:58,160
 which is the independent film were moved up and was passed so if that is ratified next year that

211
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,440
 adds two new hugos. I will be going to the Glasgow business meeting and voting against

212
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,520
 ratification. Yeah don't it's got zero chance of getting ratified I would have thought I think

213
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,000
 there'd be actual pitchforks. In theory I don't mind the idea of a category that tries to represent

214
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,680
 represents things that are not massive TV shows and massive blockbuster movies and like indeed I

215
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,880
 have some sympathy for that but I think the way you do it is firstly run a trial category so you

216
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,680
 ask Glasgow please could you use your special hugo to run this category and see if it works because

217
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,640
 putting a hugo on the ballot without the test is insane and then secondly you consult with the

218
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,880
 community you don't just spring it on people like I am not against the category in principle but

219
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
 even I will be voting against ratification because like and I will be encouraging lots of people to

220
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,320
 come with me because I'm like you don't know if this is going to work like the game hugo was

221
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,240
 carefully crafted over years and like that's on the ballot and that's how it should be done. Sorry

222
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,560
 but also this is a this is a this carves independent because we have a general rule of not having

223
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,840
 one thing eligible for multiple hugos this carves independent films out of the hugos

224
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,440
 out of the best dramatic pro inflation long form so it's it's incredibly controversial in the same

225
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,280
 way that the load star was and it's gonna take if you want to have something like that it's

226
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,920
 gonna take decades to get it sorted or at least a decade and also everything everywhere all at

227
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:36,960
 once is won you know it's it's definitely definitely or the indecided happened to be a massive blockbuster

228
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,200
 but there was no reason to expect that to be the case. How do they define independent film Liz?

229
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,680
 I don't think this is particularly worth discussing how they define it but what I would say is we

230
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,200
 have complained a lot on this podcast about the business meeting and how difficult it is to

231
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
 figure out what's going on at the business meeting and how difficult it is to work out what's going

232
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,840
 on so when this amendment is brought by two Chinese members of the world con a world con which seems

233
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,480
 to have had a ton of stuff about like independent films and small films in the film industry

234
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,040
 generally it may just be they thought the best way to get people discussing it was to put it

235
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,640
 forward as an amendment it's hard to know kind of from the outside exactly how much work went into

236
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,160
 best game yeah no that is fair to get it up there and how many years that took so I'm gonna give

237
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,760
 them a pass I mean I think they're gonna probably fail to be ratified I just think it's people

238
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,120
 saying well this is the things we're interested in can we have an award for them and if you don't

239
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,720
 you know spend a lot of time reading business meeting minutes then probably you think that's

240
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,520
 the best way to get them get them on the agenda because maybe it isn't other places but it turns

241
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,720
 out if there was a best way to get something passed is basically now to build you know spend a lot

242
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,040
 of time building support before you actually bring it to the business meeting which is not

243
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,440
 immediately obvious if it's just like would you like to pro some business send us an email I'm

244
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,320
 not opposed to the two people who brought the amendment I will say and there was a little baby

245
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,800
 faced Cox and who brought an amendment to Chicago 2012 Chai Khan 7 with Emily Arrow I think

246
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,320
 reporting a best very short category for dramatic presentation because we wanted to see more

247
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,960
 short films get hoo-hoo's so like I genuinely am sympathetic to this the thing that annoys me is

248
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,760
 that they passed it yeah like I'm not disappointed with the two uh proposals I'm disappointed with

249
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,840
 literally everyone else in the room there weren't that many people in the room maybe 40 and that

250
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,680
 might have included quite a few Chinese fans who had never had any previous experience with the

251
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,920
 business meeting when this opens up a really big can of worms right which is like if the Chinese

252
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,160
 fans got one thing through an iO Western fan I'm like boo is that good of me but equally I really

253
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,120
 don't think this is a category we need but also this is why you want to have online presence at

254
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,280
 your business meeting so you do in fact have a permanent group of people are interested in this

255
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:02,080
 I can come in from everywhere so hmm maybe this is the best argument for actually sorting that

256
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,600
 problem out which is do you want best independent film hoo-hoo's because that's how you get best

257
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,680
 independent film hoo-hoo's is it called best independent film or is it called best dramatic

258
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,320
 presentation independent it's called is best independent short film award and best independent

259
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,720
 feature film award there are two oh yeah there's two soon there'll be more hugos than cacopos

260
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,360
 now i'm transitioned to thinking this is very funny and if we can get a ratified that increases

261
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,600
 the number of hugos by three in three years and and that would be that would really like if if

262
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,440
 if that makes people angry enough to sort out online participation with the business meeting

263
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,280
 which I repeat should be a doggle uh then we can just do this and that'll be good but they're

264
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,160
 trying to actively prevent it they're actually going further in the other direction so you know

265
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,880
 everyone go to the business meeting at Glasgow and propose to ratify have you reversed your

266
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,360
 position completely in the last five minutes of the podcast because if you have yes because if

267
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,600
 ratifying these two makes the nerds angry enough that they finally open up the business meeting online

268
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,640
 that is a concrete win no they won't no no they won't and then and then we just propose ever more

269
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,640
 bizarre things when the world comes not in North America best fresh language film

270
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,840
 yes when it's in nieced best film involving a man who surfs and lives in a landlocked city

271
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,920
 yeah okay anyway thank you for bringing this to our attention Liz this is sparking lots of joy

272
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,160
 convention time bracket was amended to replace preferably between first august to the 30th of

273
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:43,120
 september we and past as amended that's just to say no more discons isn't it no more christmas

274
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,080
 worldcon well I think this come would have been all right because it's not quite that late but

275
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,800
 yeah it's all kind of like it's it's nitpicking things and cleaning them up yeah I mean there are

276
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,480
 other things that passed some of which are quite sensible basically the thing about works appearing

277
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,000
 in a language other english being eligible um in the year its first issued in english has been

278
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,720
 tweaked because it makes more sense to not say english but say the language of the convention

279
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,920
 that year because otherwise you kind of block I think this would actually have blocked some

280
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:25,120
 things which came out in translation but came out you know in in in tina in a particular year like

281
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,800
 there was some edge case that they wanted to fix and it sounds like this went to committee and

282
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,600
 they did something sensible and that and they fixed it so we'll go with that does it basically

283
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,800
 add the language of the hosting convention and english or is it does it replace english with

284
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,960
 the language of the hosting convention it replaces english with the language of the countries of

285
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,520
 the administering and previous year worldcon and here it is just today translated to a main

286
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,040
 language of the country the ministry in previous year worldcon I think it covers things that were

287
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,160
 published in english and then translated into chinese not being eligible in the year they could

288
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,120
 be read by them what what it means is so like obviously this year it would have been fine the

289
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,200
 thing i would say would have been fine because it went chicago chenghu so that's english and chinese

290
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,080
 what it would mean is that if last year it had been held in france and this year was in chenghu

291
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,160
 any chinese language science fiction that had only just been translated into english wouldn't

292
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,240
 have been eligible and that feels like a shame to me because a lot of the voters are still reading

293
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,520
 in english and so i do think that building in support for works which are translated into

294
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,600
 english in the year of the worldcon does make more international works eligible for the award

295
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,800
 which i think probably benefit international science fiction more than removing that does

296
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,640
 so from the perspective of having more international stuff on the ballot i kind of wish they hadn't

297
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,840
 gone that way but maybe i'm wrong i don't know it's a very nitpicky point because it will

298
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,040
 i think i haven't i think i haven't quite got my head around this because it changes the language

299
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,440
 requirement but also changes the works immediately published outside the usa to

300
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,600
 countries of the ministering and previous it will come again i think i'll need to

301
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,200
 really sit down and think about it that's interesting yeah because that means that like

302
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,200
 if something had been published in if it had been london then chengdu well and it's about to be

303
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,080
 chengdu then glasgo so anything that's published in the us for the first time in 2024 won't be eligible

304
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,320
 and it would used to have been if this would if this had already been ratified so i i think

305
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,440
 this is a well-meaning amendment that on the face of it seeks to make the constitution less

306
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,480
 parochial but i think will probably actually make it more parochial by by basically meaning that

307
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,760
 a america fans can't vote for things that haven't made it big in america yet i think it's designing

308
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,440
 language for the worldcon we wish we had rather than the worldcon we actually have and i think

309
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,080
 that's very laudable but this all still just gives stuff an extra year of eligibility it doesn't

310
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,440
 mean it's not eligible it just gives it an extra year based on slightly different criteria right

311
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,320
 i think maybe we should hold this over and really i need to think about the different you know this

312
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,160
 was published here in this year in this situation and we can discuss that asfic another time asfic

313
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,680
 can fuck off that's my opinion yeah i just like the idea of it be called asfic well because i do

314
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,920
 want to say i think ispania is right about asfic it's time for ispania's opinion

315
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,720
 dah dah dah dah dah dah jingle ispania has always pointed out the reason that nazphic is codified

316
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,200
 in the waspus constitution is that if the worldcon is held outside the us and that means that the

317
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,520
 main convention which is often held in the us is not in the us that incentivizes us fans to vote

318
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,320
 against foreign world cons and the reason that nazphic is in the constitution is so that you don't

319
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,240
 have an incentive for north american fans to vote against non-north american world cons and so that

320
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,840
 provision is there mostly to encourage there to be world cons outside north america which is another

321
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,840
 example of how what looks like on the face of it a pro-keel provision in the constitution is actually

322
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,600
 acting to try to make the organization less pro-keel if we had like a truly egalitarian society we

323
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,360
 wouldn't need any of our affirmative action policies because all of the jobs would go to the best

324
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,840
 people regardless of like gender or ethnicity but because we do not have a truly egalitarian

325
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,600
 society we have to have lots of very tedious things that like try and make it more egalitarian

326
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,040
 yes so you're saying that american fandom is even more pro-keel than we had thought

327
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:24,560
 no i'm i'm saying i'm saying that you need to incentivize the behavior you want to see in your

328
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:30,720
 society i think not incentivizing that and crossing your fingers you get it anyway is a bad way of

329
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,880
 going about these things no that's often fine but i mean if you're saying that the reason the

330
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:42,640
 nazphic is encoded is embodied in the constitution is to discourage american fans from voting against

331
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,800
 foreign world cons which they would do otherwise um that's basically saying oh we accept that american

332
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:55,600
 fandom is ossley xenophobic and we've had to do something to deal with it no that's that's bullshit

333
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,200
 you told me you weren't going to see janelle mene and manchester because you couldn't be

334
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,440
 asked to go to manchester and she should play in london thank you it is exactly the same thing

335
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,840
 people tend to go to things they can go to and voting for the thing you can go to or the thing

336
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,320
 you can't i don't think it's unfair to vote for the thing you can go to for much the same way

337
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,200
 that if there's like well i mean firstly there's vanished been vanishingly few eastercoms in whales

338
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,120
 on northern island which is partly due to venues but also partly because there are bugger for most

339
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,240
 eastercom attendees to get to it's 100% to do with venues and zero potential you know lots of people

340
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,880
 have tried this multiple times it is not 100 to 0 i will guarantee you that i so put it this way

341
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,800
 if they ever said let's have the eastercon at the um at that hotel that novicon uses i would vote

342
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,240
 against it because i don't want to have to go to buckston because it's ages away and i don't think

343
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,560
 that makes me xenophobic i think incentivizing the behaviors you want to see is sensible do we think

344
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:58,000
 the nazvik really incentivizes people anymore well no i don't think it does nail but i definitely

345
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 think there was a period for a long time where that did work in the right way and so it might be

346
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,560
 time now to get rid of it but i think a lot of the discussion about this ignores ignores how

347
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:17,120
 things used to be and how they have changed for the better um but i do i do think having metrics

348
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,520
 like the constitution has always sought to make sure that the constitution can't just stay

349
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,240
 so sorry that the convention can't just stay in one place and that it has to travel and i think

350
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,520
 the nazvik is part of that attempt to force it to travel and so like i'm not saying it should

351
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,560
 still be there because i do think at this point the world con has become properly i mean maybe this

352
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,360
 is just my bias as like someone who's only come into it sort of in the last sort of 15 years but

353
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,120
 it seems to me like it's much more international that was like in the past and i would be surprised

354
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,320
 if that went backwards again and i think it's probably slightly more fragile when you think i think

355
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,680
 the cost of getting around the world is going to shock a lot of people over the next few years

356
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,040
 klaska is going to be a real wake-up call well that's the other thing right as as travel was getting

357
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,520
 cheaper i think the nazvik became less and less relevant but now now travel is getting more

358
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:14,560
 expensive again post pandemic i do wonder whether you're right and it's often very it's very alluring

359
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:20,080
 i think to think oh i've won the argument i can stop worrying about this but so in general i don't

360
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,760
 support the waspus implementing asvick because i think it's cultural appropriation that wouldn't

361
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,360
 do anything to help the world travel worldwide which is but that that's to say that's not in contrast

362
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,440
 with my opinion that likes the fact the nazvik is in the constitution i actually do think it might

363
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,560
 be important that the nazvik is properly codified in the constitution despite the fact it looks

364
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,200
 pro-kill and and that's why i have that opinion about the previous thing liz was talking about was

365
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,160
 because i also wonder whether that's something that looks pro-kill but removing it will actually

366
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,000
 work in the opposite way to what people think it will and this is something that worries me

367
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,480
 sometimes when we have these these discussions i think hopefully that's all useful and reasonable

368
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,560
 insight and not just the wafflings of a lunatic could go either way though couldn't it

369
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:12,960
 i think we should do asvick at a different time asvick asvick nazvik and also it's got changed so i

370
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,680
 think we should yeah probably hold over some of this until we can properly discuss it so it might

371
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,800
 have been a bit of a waste of time but just because i think there'll be a full business meeting

372
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,240
 report an asvick is now like also generalized to regional stuff not just ajour anymore but i can

373
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,520
 see why again i can see why someone submitted it you're like why is there a nazvik why does a nazvik

374
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,600
 exist why don't we have one no yeah no exactly exactly yeah i i think that's right i i think

375
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,080
 this could be a long discussion yes we we will come back to this on future episodes listeners

376
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,440
 if you have opinions right in yeah um somebody something else that people have said on

377
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,040
 about apodcasters that we talk about world cons way too much so that's the thing we did just have

378
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,240
 one well i mean it's difficult it's it i mean that's a difficult criticism to respond to the

379
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,000
 episode that happened right after world con isn't it i haven't even done hugo stats yet because we

380
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,320
 don't have the hugos that's it yeah i did we can't do hugo stats the one thing i did want to do that

381
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:18,880
 we haven't mentioned yet is site selection voting because they were 168 ballots cast wow yeah that's

382
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,400
 not many it's not knowing we were some contestants and no one could be bothered when also it was

383
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,320
 really hard to vote that's not why it was it was no harder than usual to vote from like well it was

384
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,120
 harder than it was harder than in the years that they've managed to implement online voting but it

385
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,200
 wasn't i'd say it was easier than the health sinky vote which is only about well eight years ago

386
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,080
 that was hard vote yeah but there was a reason to vote for health sinky because it was yeah multi-way

387
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,960
 contested i guess what i mean is it's an uncontested year and it was harder to vote than it could have

388
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,920
 been and i it's slightly harder than it could have been pdf scribbling a pdf to send it to hell

389
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,400
 and Montgomery i think was the way you think who then printed off your ballot without looking at it

390
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,120
 and put it in a sealed envelope and took it to China with her um yes and the face palm emoji you have

391
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,640
 just demonstrated is how i feel about this i don't know that wasn't a face palm that was me pretending

392
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,680
 to be Helen covering my eyes as i was printing out the ballots don't look don't look don't look

393
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,080
 but in fact i voted i very have to say that i voted for Seattle what do you think it was though

394
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:30,720
 Alison Seattle was not offering a discount for voters which is why the vote count is so low had i

395
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,920
 known that i would not have voted so there we go i feel like i put a lot of work into voting that was

396
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,800
 not a lot of work but slightly more work than maybe necessary into voting that that wasn't really

397
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,080
 very much rewarded and they did it because they thought that generating a vote would involve

398
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,680
 giving people's details to China and some people didn't want to do that so they made a direct decision

399
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,400
 i believe not to have a voting discount you couldn't because you had to get a membership in Chengdu

400
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,960
 to buy the site section token but i wonder whether they could have solved it by saying we'll offer a

401
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,080
 voting discount or a pre-support discount i wonder if they could have sold like some pre-support tier

402
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,520
 which converted into a supporting membership in the same way that a vote would have done

403
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,600
 because the thing is that i guess the reason i say that is that they're not they don't have

404
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:26,000
 much money then like what's 185 times 20 like i i think if i was them i would have thought quite

405
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,800
 carefully about how i was going to replace that revenue stream because it doesn't seem like an

406
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,800
 obviously good thing to incentivize people not to join so i might have thought about how to

407
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,240
 incentivize people to join but you know i've never run a world con so who knows a lot of people

408
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,600
 will join now right and also i'm a sucker who voted i did not vote i think people will join now

409
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:56,720
 but also there have been issues with getting like pre-supports and money around to because of

410
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,840
 tend to get them into Chengdu right and they had to set up like a holding company in the US so

411
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,560
 it may be that all the finances are just weird and also that some pass along that couldn't get to

412
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,400
 Chengdu because of logistical issues may now pass on to Glasgow and Seattle it might be that they

413
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,600
 know what they're doing and they've got new branding which is no longer which is no longer

414
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:24,800
 riffing off a major corporations logo that's probably a good a good thing yeah i mean i did like the

415
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,040
 it was cute yeah i would say it's time for it's time for his spani is opinion

416
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:38,080
 da da da da jingle um so his family was happy about the guests of honor she says Bridget Landry

417
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:46,320
 is a good value space and cosplay guest and is a regular at los cons and Alexander James Adams

418
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,720
 is a bay con uh was a bay con guest and is a noted fillker apparently so she is very excited for both

419
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,760
 of those people um the other guests are nissy shawl k-tempoest bradford denato jian cola and

420
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,040
 martha wells so it does seem like a good seems like a good ballad something for everyone perhaps

421
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,240
 um i'm excited about you know quite a few of those guests so who are and i might go to Seattle because

422
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,200
 i like Seattle although i might also not because i might be poor we'll see

423
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:26,240
 and now it's time for picks uh it's been ages since we did our last picks uh i think you're both

424
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:36,400
 agree so i am going to pick i'm going to pick a movie i'm going to pick the movie halloween

425
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,200
 by john carpenter which i watched for the first time so this is a slightly delayed

426
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,480
 belated pick but this is the first episode post halloween uh so it seems relevant

427
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,560
 it's fanny and i have a rule that during october all of the films we watch have to be horror so

428
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,320
 we went to watch for friday the 13th on friday the 13th which was great and then we watch halloween

429
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,000
 halloween is amazing a young jamelee kurtis absolutely smashing it out of the park uh in every way

430
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,560
 genuinely scary and unsettling just yeah really enjoyed it and i also enjoyed the trivia that

431
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,760
 ispania delighted in telling me that the mask that the main antagonist wears uh was basically

432
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,280
 the cheapest mask they could find at the local um store spray painted white and it turns out the

433
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,480
 cheapest mask was a william shatnam mask so under his terrifying visage there is a terrifying

434
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:35,440
 visage good good movie uh obviously not if you don't like horror but john carpenter um just

435
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,200
 obviously a fantastic director and uh really good really good film we watched it on lion's

436
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,520
 gate plus oh god is that another thing to subscribe to yeah we only survived for a month we tried

437
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,080
 watching on pluto tv but firstly it had adverts and i don't know if you know this adverts detract

438
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:57,040
 from the sense of terror in a horror movie like you know premiere in and it's like that is quite

439
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,680
 terrifying but not in the same way uh and also there were no subtitles and uh and i really i was

440
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,400
 willing to pay five pounds to be able to work out what the dialogue was uh because for those who

441
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,680
 don't listen regularly i am slightly deaf i like a good premiere here i put one for glasco no

442
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,800
 premiere ends are good it was a cheap joke i am also in a premiere in for glasco cheap joke at

443
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,800
 the expense of premiering are we all in the same premiere in for glasco i think the premiere in

444
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,560
 a gla yeah basically liz allison and i have a rule that whatever hotel we stay in for a convention

445
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,680
 must match the octa thought logo and so we are all obviously in the premiere in which is naturally

446
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,480
 purple how did the heart regency how did the heart regency match the octa thought logo i spray

447
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,720
 baneid it purple oh that explains it don't worry boo i got you john is just making a

448
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:57,040
 cheap joke a cheap joke a lot of them today um liz what's your pick my pick is a tv show that i

449
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,160
 largely watched on a plane just breaking allison sort of watching things on planes uh it is poker

450
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,840
 face starring natechelyon and created by natechelyon and ryan johnson of you know glass onion fame etc

451
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,880
 um it's really good what streaming services at all i was on it was on a plane

452
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,520
 i will do a google but i think the answer might be yarr

453
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:27,360
 i really wanted to watch this because because natechelyon is like a murder mystery series about

454
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:33,440
 a woman who has a psychic ability right liz yeah she knows when people are lying nice which is

455
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,800
 great but she's essentially like she's not operating you know as a law enforcement officer

456
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,280
 anything she's basically operating i don't want to give too many spoilers but basically she's

457
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,520
 operating outside this and trying not to attract the attention of law enforcement and also it's

458
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,560
 really clever with how it uses a gift because she can't literally go up to people a lot the time

459
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,600
 and say oh you're lying or you know sometimes she picks people up because they've done like a trivial

460
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,480
 lie and sometimes people do trivial white lies for all kinds of reasons but sometimes they're

461
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,280
 doing a trivial lie because it's actually covering up that they committed a murder and it spends a

462
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:14,400
 lot of time in each episode kind of setting up the other characters in the show around

463
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,160
 a tashley aunt she's basically a different place every week and it's setting up kind of that that

464
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,080
 weeks cast and and murderer and murder victim and supporting cast and they're all really great and

465
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:30,480
 there's some amazing like guest actors in there as well i'm looking at like the list of

466
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,800
 Wikipedia Ron Perlman, John Ratzenberger, who's the other one i saw that i thought was great,

467
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,880
 Nick Noltee, Joseph Gordon Levitt, like yeah that is some Rhea Perlman who doesn't get enough work

468
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,160
 Tim Blake Nelson, yes! Jamey Lidrimet, I'm going to stop reading names now Liz and let you get

469
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:55,280
 back to your segment. I am also going to say for the benefit of listeners sky, sky and now tv

470
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,640
 is how you can watch it in the UK. So for that month that you decide it's worth taking now tv

471
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,760
 that's the thing to watch. And there's 10 episodes all about an hour long there is a kind of overarching

472
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,960
 plot in kind of that you know the last episode refers back to the first and sets it up for like

473
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,400
 the next series i think there will be a future series yeah you should just go and watch it it's

474
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,920
 good. Yeah the tashley aunts very good. Alison, at the time of release you're back from your

475
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:30,160
 golf trip you've had loads of time to watch films and movies what's your pick? My pick this week is

476
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,960
 New Zealand. Hey! New Zealand is a country it's it's very attractive it's full of

477
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,880
 lovely and interesting wildlife and lovely people and you should definitely go there and visit there

478
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,200
 and i was there for about 10 days and i had a brilliant time and i would strongly recommend

479
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,080
 New Zealand yes um do i need to say any more about it it's on the other side of the world it's

480
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,240
 quite a bit to get to unless you're already in New Zealand in which case it's right there.

481
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,800
 Yeah but in that case we really are fansplaining to New Zealanders about New Zealand aren't we?

482
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,000
 Like have you heard of this place called New Zealand? Yeah yeah it's good.

483
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,760
 At some point there will be more reportage of New Zealand after i've had some sleep.

484
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,760
 So at the moment my all my reportage is in like huge piles of notes most of which have been delivered

485
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:29,200
 in in the form of text to Claire Bralley and also some to my husband and to other people.

486
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,920
 I don't know John, have I texted you at all? Probably not much. People have had a few texts

487
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,120
 and and i've got to collect all this stuff. I've been trying not to text you too much because i'm

488
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,560
 worried i'm interrupting your lovely time. You won't because i just i just only look at my phone

489
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:51,360
 but i have time to it's all right. That's fair. As Alison said last episode there's nothing quite

490
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:57,200
 i've never done anything before since that was quite like my TAFT trip and it is the only people

491
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,200
 who really get it. I think other people who have done it. I should say that i have not found a life

492
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,720
 partner on this guff trip i just want to make this clear. I mean Stephen's going to be given that

493
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,560
 you were with Stephen for three weeks. I took one with me. We had one day off

494
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,920
 Stephen travel with me for three weeks. We had one day off guff where we kind of sat around

495
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:27,040
 circular key and at dinner with like the the Sydney Opera House and the and the Harbor Bridge and

496
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,960
 and kind of said how we'll celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary because fun fact our actual

497
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,360
 25th wedding anniversary is tomorrow we're going to be well it's today now apparently but not for him.

498
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,600
 We're going to be 12,000 miles apart which is almost as far apart as you can get without

499
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:51,120
 actually going off planet and that was the Octa Thought podcast and it's goodbye from me.

500
00:46:51,120 --> 00:47:01,600
 It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.

501
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:29,040
 The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin McLeod in Com

502
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:39,040
