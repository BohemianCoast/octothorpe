1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Damn straight.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 Alison just cut out for me for a minute then.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,040
 Was it just me or did she cut out for John as well?

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,320
 Well she cut out for me but I'll hear what she said when I'm editing.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,320
 So...

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,480
 And he doesn't care that much so...

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,320
 I'd just take a very long view of these things, Liz.

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,320
 I'm like one day I will know.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,960
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 12th episode of Oct. Thorpe,

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,400
 a podcast about science fiction and science fiction fandom.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,480
 This is the episode for Thursday the 20th of August.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,000
 I am John Coxson.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
 I am Alison Scott.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,720
 And I'm Liz Betty.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,240
 And we are not in Liz's house.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,960
 This is true of all three of us this week.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,360
 This is the bit where Liz tells us she's having a fantastic beach holiday

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
 and we go, oh yeah no.

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,720
 We quite fancy a fantastic beach holiday.

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,000
 Thank you very much.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,240
 But it's not about to happen anytime soon.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,240
 Is it unless by fantastic beach you mean "margate" which we don't?

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,560
 You could go to a night, you could go to like Devon or Cornwall or somewhere like that.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
 Devon and Cornwall are full.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,480
 I repeat, Devon and Cornwall are full.

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,400
 Please do not travel to Devon or Cornwall.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,840
 They are full.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,480
 This has been a public service announcement.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,320
 But yes, I am having a very nice beach holiday on an island which is a very,

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,880
 very long way from full.

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,160
 It's been very nice.

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,080
 Which is good for you and bad for the tight tourist industry.

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,280
 It's also been a little bit sad to go into restaurants where clearly they have had three

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,080
 customers today.

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,960
 My experience of visiting the Arctic Circle in August was like that.

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,160
 But obviously they would have had snow later and had tourists later.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,440
 I'm sure that Thai beaches will get tourists again in due course.

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,480
 But it might be a little while.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,320
 Maybe a little while.

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,600
 I am compensating by just going into restaurants and eating more food than I really need to eat

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
 because I feel sad.

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,960
 So that's your excuse?

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,120
 That's the human condition.

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,800
 I regularly eat more food than I need to eat because I am sad.

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,720
 Which explains why I am this shape.

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
 You seem to be a very nice shape, John.

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,720
 Oh, thank you, Alison.

48
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,960
 That's the episode, Ty, all right there.

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,240
 You seem to be sort of John shaped, you know.

50
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,920
 I don't know what to do.

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,520
 Oh, all the glow.

52
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,760
 Sorry, this is a body positive podcast which is not going to allow any body

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
 just more for you to get by.

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,520
 So we got a letter of comment from Amazon Music podcast team.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
 And they say, hello, podcaster.

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,200
 We're excited to let you know that Amazon Music and Audible will be adding

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
 podcasts to their respective services.

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
 This information is confidential.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
 Whoops.

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,240
 Thus concludes the letters of comment.

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,440
 And then did they actually invite us to do anything or?

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,320
 We can submit our podcast to Amazon,

63
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,400
 which I guess we should probably do.

64
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,560
 Like because they just link to it.

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,600
 They don't rehost it.

66
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,680
 So I have no, I have no like a priori objection to doing that.

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,200
 Disorderable then say you can use your Audible credits to listen to what

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,360
 to thought because I would have to say that would be a terrible, terrible idea.

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
 Yes, if you are listening to this and you have spent an audible credit,

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,800
 please contact us and we will send you a book.

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,520
 It might not be the book you'd want.

72
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,960
 I can't promise it'll be a good book.

73
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,280
 We record an audio book of your choice.

74
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,520
 That might be quite a lot of work.

75
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,880
 It might be quite a lot.

76
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,560
 It's a very hungry caterpillar.

77
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,120
 Just send him a book.

78
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,320
 You guys must have enough books.

79
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,400
 You can just basically pick one at random and check it out.

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
 Yeah, it'll be fine.

81
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,200
 Okay, so I think probably we didn't get a lot of genuine letters of comment

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,480
 because people were in the chat in the last live episode.

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,720
 So made their comments there and we hope everyone enjoyed it.

84
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,480
 [Music]

85
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,360
 As we mentioned in the last episode, we shied away from talking about serious

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,640
 fanish concerns because Alison was riding that Conzeland high

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,840
 and I was sleep deprived owing to too many board games.

88
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,200
 But this episode is the episode of the serious fanish concerns.

89
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,560
 In the run up to Conzeland, there was a lot of discussion in various

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:48,480
 fanish low-counles about the Saudi Arabia world-comped for Jeddah in 2022,

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,520
 which was going up against Chicago.

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:00,000
 The site selection vote resulted in Chicago being elected to Chicon 8

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,920
 in a quite convincing majority.

94
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,520
 But there was a lot of chats about Saudi Arabia prior to that happening.

95
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:18,080
 Just for context, Chicago received 89.8% of the vote with 517 ballots cast in its favour.

96
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:27,040
 Jeddah are rebidding for 2026 because they basically went for the first year that there were

97
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,200
 no bids and 2026 is it.

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,800
 So I have now become Facebook friends and also Discord friends, I think,

99
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,840
 with Yasubad Jatt, who is the driving force behind the Jeddah-Con bid.

100
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,640
 Anna Smith-Spark, who was the instigator, is not somebody I know well,

101
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,200
 but I do know lots of people who signed it and they're kind of, some of them are saying,

102
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,920
 well, we didn't really understand the Wusses process and we wanted to make a statement about

103
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,240
 Saudi Arabia's suitability for Worldcons, which has left a lot of Wusses people feeling very

104
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,080
 aggrieved, particularly the ones who went into their threads in the discussion on the

105
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,960
 fantasy society. Facebook page, I think it was, that sparked this off and actually explained how

106
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,360
 it all worked before the letter was sent and the letter got sent anyway and it got picked up

107
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,600
 by the Guardian because the Guardian knows that a good way to generate hits and therefore

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,600
 advertising sales is to find storms in teacups and say, would it help if we put this storm into

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,480
 a bucket for you? So I think that made it quite a lot worse than it might otherwise have been,

110
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,440
 because of the Wusses for members, as you would expect, voted overwhelmingly for Chicago,

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,160
 with the other votes being split evenly between no award and Jeddah, so it's not even that Jeddah

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,280
 got 10% of the votes, they got about 5% of the votes. But obviously they weren't the sort of

113
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,000
 votes where people thought that they might win, so it's kind of petered out and if it comes up again

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,600
 in 2026, I feel that Smoughs will ensure that there is a strong bid against it, because Smoughs do

115
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,560
 that sort of thing. Which brings us to 2023, where we have a different sort of problem because we have

116
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,200
 Chengdu mounting, as far as I can tell, a perfectly competent bid for China, which people don't want

117
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,400
 to win for many of the same reasons they don't want Jeddah to win, but without the excuse that the

118
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,080
 Jeddah people clearly didn't have the fattest idea what was involved in running a Wilcon.

119
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,240
 It's clear that Chengdu know what is involved and can do it and have demonstrated that they

120
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,680
 could do it with a large, as a convention of similar sort of size and structure, but all Chinese, to

121
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,720
 which they invited a dozen Smoughs to come over and watch, so they clearly can do it. So that's not

122
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,760
 an argument to not have a Chengdu Wilcon. The arguments have not a Chengdu Wilcon are much more

123
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:58,320
 difficult, problematic and subtle, and they are up against Memphis, which is not the best bid for

124
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,160
 a third consecutive US Wilcon. In summary, Jeddah just kind of spud itself out, and if it tries to do

125
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,560
 it again, it'll get competed with. But Chengdu is a much bigger issue because on most objective

126
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,760
 arguments, you would have to say that Chengdu have the better bid. So I think what the open letter

127
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,560
 was calling for, basically they saw a place being allowed to bid for a Wilcon as an endorsement of

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,240
 that bid in some way because we put it on the ballot. And I mean, I've generally been of the

129
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,840
 opinion that fans will just not vote for things and that's okay. And I don't see it being allowed

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,120
 to bid as being an endorsement of it, but clearly some people do and have a problem with that.

131
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,360
 And I think the problem you then get to is, okay, so what you want is for us not to allow places to

132
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,640
 bid because they fall below some human rights standard, but actually setting a standard for that

133
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:59,680
 is incredibly difficult. And I'm not sure how I would go about doing it. I mean, for me personally,

134
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,080
 I have no intention of going to Saudi Arabia. I think I may be allowed to go to Saudi Arabia,

135
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,040
 provided, you know, I cover my knees and shoulders and possibly hair all times and so on. But

136
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,640
 John would have to sponsor us. I think that would be very strange. I cannot imagine either of you

137
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,920
 ever. Yeah, no, that was what my kenny said. I think it's I'm quite entertained by the idea that

138
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:39,360
 we would do what John tells us. It has to happen at any point so far. I don't expect it ever to

139
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,200
 happen. I don't think I'd ever try. I've got too much self-preservation. I believe that defenders

140
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,840
 of Saudi Arabia do say if you think that women do what their male sponsor tells you to, you really

141
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,600
 don't know very many Saudi Arabian women. But yeah, I can I can see that, you know, Saudi Arabia is a

142
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,040
 place where I would not feel comfortable visiting. Whereas I feel that China is a place where I would

143
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,600
 feel comfortable visiting. And I think for the majority of Worldcon attendees, they would not feel

144
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,240
 that comfortable visiting Saudi Arabia, whereas many more of them would feel comfortable visiting

145
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,080
 China, possibly. I don't know. I haven't pulled the Worldcon membership on that. But I think I think

146
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,920
 setting setting a bar seems to be a non-starter because I can't work out a way you would do it.

147
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,640
 And the way of doing it, which is it appears on the ballot and then we don't vote for them

148
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,200
 seems better. But you're right. I mean, the other issue is that when the Jeddah bid was questioned

149
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,920
 about things like, okay, so it is illegal to be queer in in Saudi Arabia. Their response was kind

150
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,000
 of, well, if you don't tell anyone it won't be a problem, which is a completely unsatisfactory

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,360
 response. Whereas I don't think that particular issue is a problem in China. It's more China's

152
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,200
 general human rights record and also their, you know, recent actions in Hong Kong. So I think next

153
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,040
 year is going to be very interesting because next year you truly will be voting on,

154
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,480
 is this a place that you feel comfortable visiting or you feel comfortable awarding a Worldcon to?

155
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
 And for Saudi Arabia, there was never a chance we were going to do that. So it wasn't really a

156
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,080
 question. No, and this is, um, this is the problem because I think, and me and España had a long

157
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,760
 conversation about this. For those who don't know, España is my wife. It is very difficult because

158
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:30,160
 I agree that I don't really see how you can come up with a, um, coherent, single, um, statement of

159
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,120
 who should be allowed to bid for Worldcons and who shouldn't be allowed to. Um, I, I think that

160
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,680
 would be very complicated. I think you'd rather risk of excluding countries that are fine or

161
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,320
 including countries that are not. Um, and like, I do also wonder whether the fact that we are a

162
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:56,160
 predominantly anglospheric community means that we would be more likely to write the rules in a way

163
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,600
 that made it easier for anglosphere countries in the anglosphere to, to not be penalized for

164
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,520
 their various issues than countries outside the anglosphere. Um, see also like, you know,

165
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,000
 US police brutality and stuff like that. I don't, I don't think there are people in the community

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,520
 who have argued that the US shouldn't be allowed to host Worldcons, including Patrick

167
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:25,200
 Nielsen Hayden. Um, but I don't know to what extent the US is as bad as China. Um, I suspect the US

168
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 is not as bad as China, but equally I am married to a citizen and I've been to the US a lot and I've

169
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,400
 been over to China. So it may well be that my experience is my privilege bias me in my, um, decision

170
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:42,560
 making on that. The issue is how you come up with rules that you could reasonably enforce. Um,

171
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,200
 and then if you manage to do that, what body would reasonably enforce them. So I can see an

172
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,200
 argument that it would be like fairer to have a codified rule. Um, rather than discussing it every

173
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,840
 time there's a problematic Worldcon over again, but I equally don't really know what that would look

174
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,960
 like. Okay, so every Worldcon is problematic in its own way. I was going to say all unproblematic

175
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,000
 Worldcons are a light, but I don't think they're any unproblematic Worldcons. So I think, I think,

176
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,400
 I think there are issues which might cause you to vote for or against any Worldcon that are not

177
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,160
 entirely who is the team doing this and are they competent to do it. I think I did see when people

178
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,880
 were discussing the Saudi Arabian bid, a kind of assumption that they must be backed by Saudi

179
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,760
 Arabian government money, or they were doing this in some way to get themselves visas to visit

180
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,960
 other countries. And it seems we make that assumption about the Saudi Arabian bid in a way I've never

181
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,960
 seen as make about any other place other than China. And the some, at least some of the people

182
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,520
 behind the Saudi Arabian bid have been visiting Worldcons since at least 2014. So there's no reason

183
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,840
 think they're doing it just so they can leave the country. And I think they genuinely are just fans

184
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,000
 of science fiction and Worldcons who would like to bring one to their country, but haven't really

185
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,600
 thought through how they do that, or how their country would be perceived by the people voting.

186
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,560
 I don't see any reason to immediately leak to assume that bids from countries that haven't

187
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,120
 necessarily had Worldcons, especially non-Angleosphere ones, are somehow being supported or kind of

188
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,720
 contrived in a way that we don't usually jump to think about say that Finland bid.

189
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,920
 I agree. I mean Finland is semi-Angleosphere. I just thought of Helsinki as it's the only place

190
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,600
 we can think of which is a new place we've taken Worldcons kind of that's non-English speaking.

191
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,800
 Yeah, so so the question of whether China can, so there is a certain amount of racism in the mix,

192
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,600
 isn't there? So I can see a situation where in a year's time there is an open letter in the Guardian

193
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,320
 from a similar group of people who are decrying the Chinese Worldcon bid for human rights problems,

194
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,040
 especially if what's happening in Hong Kong keeps going in the wrong direction, which it looks likely

195
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:07,280
 to. And we have to have a much, much more difficult conversation about whether or not,

196
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,080
 because obviously I think the three of us agree that Saudi Arabia is clearly overlying their

197
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,920
 treatment of women as a country is clearly unacceptable. And LGBT, yes.

198
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,320
 Their treatment of many people who are not cisgendered straight men is clearly a problem.

199
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,360
 China, I think it would be difficult to argue, does not also have some human rights problems.

200
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,880
 You could you could bandy around some pretty serious words about her treatment. I am

201
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,120
 personally opposed to a Chinese Worldcon because of various problems they've got with their human

202
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,840
 rights record in Hong Kong and like genocides that are perpetrated and things like that.

203
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,520
 But I think the case against China is much, much less key a cut than it is against Saudi Arabia.

204
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,880
 And my problem is like, what if the next time there's another country where the situation is

205
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,680
 less clear cut but in a different way or less clear cut in a way that means that

206
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,720
 wuswuswus members don't find it problematic, but people who are not. Currently wuswus members

207
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,000
 might find it very problematic. If we keep doing this on an ad hoc basis, do we start running into

208
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,560
 problems where our biases as a community end up putting us in situations where we have Worldcon

209
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,000
 in places that actually probably we shouldn't. What do you think?

210
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,240
 I think you're correct and we really need to brainstorm ways in which we can

211
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,840
 come to some mechanism on this. I think you're writing that we can't leave it ad hoc.

212
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,400
 I think also if you'd asked me five years ago if a Chinese Worldcon bid certain like a good idea,

213
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,800
 I would have been much more positive than I am right now. So we know things can change quite

214
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,760
 quite quickly as well. And I'm trying to think of like what would be the way of doing this.

215
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,600
 Do we need a standard questionnaire so that we can ask bids to not just give us information

216
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,880
 about how much it costs to fly there and where the nearest airport is and you know whether you

217
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,280
 can smoke in their hotel rooms. But we actually need to say, you know, are there restrictions on

218
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,480
 who can enter your country and what are they? I think those sorts of questions are already

219
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,800
 covered in the Spanish Inquisition. I've also seen the suggestion that the code of conduct should

220
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,560
 be submitted along with the bid paperwork, which seems to be to be not a bad idea because

221
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,720
 as soon as you start bidding you need to have a code of conduct. Glasgow's got one, you know,

222
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:30,000
 and that's not a very big imposition, I think. Every con by the time it files paperwork,

223
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,520
 every bid by the time it files paperwork will already have a code of conduct.

224
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,920
 Well, and I would say that in the case that having a code of conduct is a significant

225
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,960
 imposition on a bid, then it's a sort of bid we need to be significantly imposing ourselves upon.

226
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,920
 So that kind of works either way. But the thing that I actually wanted to say is I disagree with

227
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,640
 both of you that this cannot just be left to the community. The community is all we have.

228
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,920
 As you know, EasterCon runs without any sort of formal organization whatsoever and it's been

229
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:13,360
 doing so for 70 years now. And I feel that as long as you can sustain it, having the least

230
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,480
 amount of bureaucracy possibly can is a good and worthy thing. I feel that WorldCon has too

231
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,680
 much bureaucracy, which is probably a how would we, what things would we take out of the Wispus

232
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,560
 Constitution altogether, conversation for another time? I think the words we do not want it to be

233
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,200
 ad hoc and the words we do not want it to come from the community are two very separate statements.

234
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,200
 I want it to come from the community. I want it to come from the community in a way that is not

235
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,960
 having the conversation over again every year in a way that doesn't allow for any nuanced thought.

236
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,000
 Because I think that's what doing at ad hoc actually means. I think it means you do it

237
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,120
 with shouting at each other or soapboxes. And I disagree that that is the best way.

238
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:04,400
 And I think EasterCon works very well as a completely like an arctic thing. But I don't think EasterCon

239
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,720
 is ever going to have to tally the human rights abuses of Saudi Arabia and China and decide which

240
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,280
 is worse. So I think EasterCon has a little bit more wiggle room for not talking about these things

241
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,520
 once a year at the bid session in a way that is relatively un-nuanced because the nuances aren't

242
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,640
 as important. I think that's fair. So I have a few things to say. One is that you say things are

243
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,440
 covered by the vanishing position. But I think the thing is we have this kind of codified set of

244
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,760
 questions now that vanishing bids answer before the vanishing position and put online. And they

245
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,640
 are mostly to do with the kind of practical and logistical things. And maybe we do need

246
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:49,360
 some questions in there that are just as routine to every bit which are about, you know, can you tell

247
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,080
 us, you know, how welcoming your country is to different people. I mean, it's going to be very

248
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,800
 difficult to think of ways, you know, there's no way that a bid from my country with human rights

249
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,040
 issues is going to write down. And also we have this massive human rights issue. But if you have

250
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,040
 to write down, say for Saudi Arabia, the, you know, these activities are punishable by death, then

251
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,600
 it does at least give you an idea of where this country falls. Second thing I think I would say

252
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,360
 is that EasterCon does kind of move along ad hoc. But yeah, I think as John said, the issues are very

253
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,280
 different because the worst thing anyone to really propose is whether we should move an

254
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:34,560
 EasterCon to Jersey. So is this house? It's over the house in 2021. And also I'm, this is for a

255
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,200
 different podcast, but I am very worried that we will find a point which the kind of whole ad hoc

256
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,800
 nature of EasterCon collapses under some kind of stress like a pandemic. My third part was going

257
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:52,240
 to be we may be unearthing a completely different thing entirely now is that I think the barrier for

258
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,720
 entry to deciding where EasterCon's goal is lower than the barrier for entry deciding where world

259
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,080
 cons go. We still need people who, you know, vote on world cons to be part of the community. But at

260
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,880
 the moment, the financial barriers are doing that is pretty high. And there's not really way around

261
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,760
 it under the current constitution. The barrier to entry for voting on a world con is less than the

262
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,680
 barrier it's entry for a voting on an EasterCon because to vote for the EasterCon, you have to go

263
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,400
 to the EasterCon to go to to vote to a World Conside selection. You only have to spend the

264
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,560
 accurate. So I actually think although the fact that world con is gated in the way it is, I think

265
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:34,800
 means it means it feels less inclusive. And I understand why you said that. I think if you actually

266
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,000
 like do the cost analysis, unless you happen to live in the city where the EasterCon is happening.

267
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,120
 It's true. But I was more thinking like if you're at the con, you can vote, right? If you're at an

268
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,080
 EasterCon, you can vote. If you're at a WorldCon, then you have to pay more money to vote.

269
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,920
 That's true. And also I was thinking more kind of the barriers for getting involved. Like if there's

270
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,120
 an EasterCon bed, do you think it is going to go to a place and you don't think the EasterCon

271
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,960
 should go? I think there is a lower entry to getting up another bed to try and send it somewhere

272
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,280
 else than there is for WorldCon. But I think we have gone kind of way off piece at this point.

273
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,920
 I will just say very quickly that in general, I quite like the fact. I think in general, I think

274
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,760
 the last two decades have shown that Eastercons can undergo quite significant, for one of a better

275
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,280
 word, constitutional crises. And still, the complete lack of any codified constitution

276
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,520
 has just been fine. So I think the goodwill of British fandom and the desire for Eastercons to

277
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,400
 happen will probably mean that EasterCon is fine without any codification. But I think that you're

278
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,120
 right that this is a much larger. Before we move on from this discussion, we have been talking

279
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,320
 about whether or not there should be more codification about which countries are suitable for world

280
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,760
 combating and which countries are not. Cheryl Morgan wrote a post on the argument for an

281
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:01,280
 incorporated WISFS and having more continuity in WorldCon and the fact that if you had that,

282
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,640
 you'd be better able to implement these kind of long-running policies. I don't particularly

283
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,720
 know if I have many ideas about whether or not that's a good thing.

284
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,080
 I think it's another thing we should, if we're going to talk about codification,

285
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,680
 it's a thing we could take when we talk about codification more generally.

286
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,400
 But I've put it in the show notes. So if you want to read our arguments, please go and read it.

287
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:32,080
 Good article. I also observe that WISFS only really, its entire procedural system is

288
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:39,920
 used as a defense against people making effect, affecting any change. So this year, it took them

289
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,600
 six minutes to totally run a coach and horse it through their procedures in order to clear up

290
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:54,000
 all their business because the people who were in charge wanted that to happen. So as it works

291
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,880
 at the moment, it's a very firm preventer of disrupting the order. If you want change in WISFS,

292
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,120
 you have to put the constitutions essentially unchangeable without the process of persuading

293
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,840
 people that persuading individuals that they might get on board.

294
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:22,000
 Even if 95% of the Worldcon membership backed something as transparently sensible,

295
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,360
 if the 5% of WISFS nerds didn't think that was a good idea, it could not happen.

296
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,680
 And that feels to me to be a problem that WISFS should deal with,

297
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:43,280
 so that its constitution and its procedures have not necessarily led to a good democratic state at this point.

298
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,600
 Fair.

299
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:54,560
 George R. R. Martin, a man who is famous for writing long rambling novels with lots of racism and

300
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,480
 sexism in them, has turned out to be a man who is a fan of long rambling things that contain

301
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,720
 lots of sexism and racism, which has apparently surprised large amounts of fandom.

302
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,680
 Tell me more about how this all happened, Alison and Liz.

303
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,320
 I have some sympathy for Conzieland here.

304
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,480
 So it did surprise me, because I think if you come to me 5 years ago and said, do you think

305
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,920
 George R. R. Martin would be a good Hugo Toastmaster, then based off what evidence I had from like

306
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,240
 seeing it with the old Worldcon, I probably would have said, yeah, he'd be quite fun,

307
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,280
 he loves Worldcons, he's quite popular and famous and people will enjoy it, and it would have turned

308
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,560
 out that I was totally wrong. People did enjoy it, you just saw the storm in a teacup.

309
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:42,560
 This probably was a storm in a bucket in fact, but lots and lots of people did enjoy his history,

310
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:52,720
 they felt it reflected back to Silverburg's years as Toastmaster and his way of connecting

311
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:00,880
 and tying by the community. I think those people are totally wrong and I think his speech was

312
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,240
 very unfounded, but I agree that Conzieland didn't have a lot of choice. However, I'm going to do a

313
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,200
 little bit of fan history here, which is that the Toastmaster, and you could tell this from the

314
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,360
 thing, it comes from the days when the Hugos were a banquet and so if you're having a banquet,

315
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,000
 you then have an afterd in a speaker, they're a Toastmaster and they give the toast, which in

316
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,400
 this case are the Hugos, and it's all part of that very clubby sort of thing. Right, the problem of

317
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,120
 Toastmaster as a guest of honour of the Worldcon is that it's been a problematic role for a very

318
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:47,120
 long time and what most Worldcons that are sensible about this do is that they have, they do not have

319
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,440
 the Toastmaster role, they have a Hugo Host role, which is not a guest of honour of the convention,

320
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,160
 which is just a programme participant like any other, which means you can tell them what to do.

321
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,040
 If you invite somebody to be to your Toastmaster, you probably can't tell them what to do. Having said

322
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,280
 that, Conzieland almost certainly, given that George had said he wanted to do it and given that they

323
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,720
 were looking at running a convention in New Zealand and they were worried about the whole issue about

324
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,000
 whether people would come and all of that, at the point at which George said he would like to be

325
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,120
 the Toastmaster, I don't think they had a lot of choice that it was at a point where I don't think

326
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,440
 he was as problematic, I think he has become more problematic. I think he was clearly very upset by

327
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,320
 what happened with the John W. Campbell Award and decided that he was going to use what he saw as

328
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:46,640
 his chance to make a speech to weigh in on that. I think things have changed and the illustration of

329
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,720
 this is I was talking about Lomcon because my phone likes to send me pictures of what I was doing

330
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,160
 six years ago and apparently I was, you know, looking over this vast empty convention centre that

331
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,000
 was short and can be filled with people. But anyway, the point is that at Lomcon we did the retro Hugos

332
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,400
 and we did them, I think the same way Consi-Linted them, which is we had a special night where we put

333
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,080
 them on and people dressed up and there was dancing and so on and we awarded them to, you know, John

334
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,920
 W. Campbell and I don't recall hearing a lot of discussion about that after the fact, I think it

335
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:27,200
 was just a fact that yes we gave him John W. Campbell. Whereas six years later we gave some

336
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,160
 retro Hugos to John W. Campbell and that is very definitely not a thing that went without comment.

337
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,720
 So I think that shows how basically in six years we've shifted from a thing that no one even really

338
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,200
 blinked an eye about. It's possible there were people but I didn't see anything about it to a

339
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,520
 thing where many people are saying no this is, you know, a thing which undermines the Hugos and it's

340
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,160
 a disgrace that we presented any other awards in the same awards ceremony that undermines them.

341
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,960
 So I think it is an illustration of how things can shift quite quickly and people don't necessarily

342
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,080
 shift along with it. I think that Alison is right that there are people who probably did really

343
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:09,120
 enjoy the look at the fan history that George gave. Lots of them. I think my main problem is that

344
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:16,800
 the Hugos are badly structured to allow that kind of thing. Like because it would have been much

345
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:23,920
 better if George had given like a like a bunch of Hugos and then there had been a 30 minute period

346
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,200
 where George had given like a lecture on fan history maybe with some like props and slides at a script

347
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,600
 maybe and then like he had given the rest of the Hugos and he and not withstanding any comments

348
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:45,040
 that Martin made about John Campbell and how great he was in light of the fact that the Campbell

349
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,120
 Award was changed to the astounding award after generating speech last year. I think that could

350
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,240
 have been really interesting because I do think there's value to fan history. I do think obviously

351
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:02,960
 Martin has a quite broad view of that. Okay on a point of order there was a separate program item

352
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:10,480
 entitled George and Bob have a chat or something like that where George R.R. Martin and Bob Silverberg

353
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,560
 sat down for an hour to chew the fat in exactly this fashion. Clearly the Toastmaster is there

354
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,560
 to impart some of their personality on the ceremony. I think in this case the criticism was primarily

355
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,520
 that it became too much about Martin but I don't think the answer was to completely shift it the

356
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,480
 other way and I think the fact that you made the point earlier that there were people who enjoyed

357
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,040
 his interlude means that there is clearly a sweet spot here not withstanding the thing where he

358
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:44,240
 defended Campbell in a way that was frankly a rebuttal of both last year's ceremony and most of the

359
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,320
 acceptance speeches from this year. The events director for Longcon who was responsible for our

360
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,800
 retrohugo and hugo ceremony was Hela Montgomery. If Hela Montgomery had been events director of

361
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:04,880
 this they would not have taken a number of interesting structural choices that the fact that people

362
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,040
 have been trying for 50 years to reduce the length of hugo ceremony appears to have completely passed

363
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:19,920
 cosey led by in terms of their design of the ceremony. Yes. I mean in my personal experience of this was

364
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,760
 that I sent them my presenter speech and they said oh this is this is fine but it could be a bit

365
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,920
 longer. It was the perfect length. It's longer that's the length I did was longer so it was shorter than

366
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:39,360
 that so but it is still not a thing that I would expect any could have been ceremony director to

367
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,600
 ever say to any presenter. Could you make that a bit longer please?

368
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,760
 There is a video on YouTube called When the Toastmaster Talks Less that cuts a lot of the

369
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,360
 content from Martin out of the ceremony and focuses more on the people who won awards and it is

370
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,760
 four is one hour and 41 minutes long and I think there is a coherent argument because it doesn't

371
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,160
 remove the points I don't think where he actually gives the awards to people. I think it just

372
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:15,440
 reduces the speech of I. It still has plenty it still has plenty of George R.R. Martin's personality in it.

373
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,800
 I think this belief that the Toastmaster's personality won't come through is wrong.

374
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,920
 Yeah and that's the thing and he could have done a 20 minute long he could have done a 20

375
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,720
 minute long talk in the middle and it would have been a tight two hours and that would have been I

376
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,600
 think pretty much the perfect hugo ceremony because you would have had enough context you would have had

377
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,000
 a focus on the winners it would have been two hours which is a fine length of time and I think

378
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,920
 actually the the impersonaries could afford to be a bit longer because people are in a hall

379
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,720
 chatting with their mates but when you're sitting at home three or four hours is pushing it but I

380
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,840
 don't I just yeah I am bewildered by the choices they made because they could have had a really tight

381
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,680
 nice two hour long ceremony and they they didn't and I don't know why.

382
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:06,480
 Conzeland had a huge job of work to do to convert a physical convention into a virtual one they

383
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:14,000
 spent as far as I can see most of their quite limited resource to make this happen on actually

384
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,360
 tying together the nuts and bolts to make it happen and for the hugo ceremony they tried to make it

385
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,880
 as much like a physical ceremony as possible. Now my feeling was that they should probably have

386
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,960
 spent rather more time on the fun engineering parts of making that happen on the ephemeral

387
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,880
 bits and pieces of what it is to be a world-con. They did do quite well actually and we're going

388
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,640
 to talk about a convention that's not done quite quite so well in a little bit but they could still

389
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,760
 have done more there. I went to see a different award ceremony as part of my guff trip was it was

390
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,240
 the Oriales Awards and they just did it on zoom they had a youtube thing so you everyone could

391
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,760
 watch they had all the presenters and all the nominees and all the acceptors on zoom and they

392
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,920
 just had did and they had some nice skit at the beginning they had toastmasters with some flavor

393
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:10,880
 to them and it was completely fine and it wasn't grand in the way the hugo ceremony tries to be

394
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:18,800
 grand but this year it mostly just came across as amateurish and not in a good way rather than

395
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,960
 stylish which is I think what they were probably going for and it would have been fine just on as

396
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,520
 a zoom awards ceremony but I don't think they could have counted us that it wouldn't have

397
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,760
 it would have been hard for the tech crew who were like oh we need all these direct live links

398
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:44,560
 to go with that. Yeah I must admit I didn't really understand why they kept coming back to

399
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,200
 George in his actual house live I didn't because I appreciate that the hugos are kept under wraps

400
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,240
 and I appreciate that the winners are not known and so there is a coveted reality problem and

401
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,600
 that's why you don't in general tell the people awarding each hugo in advance who's won the hugo

402
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,040
 because there are problems if you do that but has there ever been a problem do you think that I

403
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,080
 would have told people who won't divide known? In this case given that George RMR team did all

404
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,520
 of the opening of envelopes and telling people who had won and given that George RMR team is

405
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,440
 presumably quite good at keeping things under his hat given that he has to keep these other

406
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,160
 his hat vis-a-vis like what's going to happen in Game of Thrones and stuff like that I kind of

407
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,920
 feel like they just looped him in and then had him record all the envelope openings in the original

408
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:39,520
 insitials I don't understand why they didn't it felt very strange. You may remember and I would invite

409
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:48,400
 listeners Nicholas White and or Tammy Coxon to comment on this the hugo balloting process was

410
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:57,600
 contracted and quite late this year and I think it's very likely that the awards were not concluded

411
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:06,320
 before the point where George RMR team's video recording elements had to be done.

412
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,840
 That's a fair point. I know that they did have they did have a tech team with George's Santa Fe

413
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:18,640
 it wasn't just George and his and his webcam they did do quite a lot of work they you know they flew

414
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:26,240
 people out to be with him so so they did they put a lot of tech into this. I think but then I would

415
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,640
 argue that like if it was the case that he had already recorded the insitials I think I probably

416
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,000
 would have just had like the name appear on screen with the man reading over the the or well it was

417
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,520
 a man but all the lady what did it alternate it was a man it was it was Norman I think um the

418
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,160
 co-chair of the convention. Oh was it? Who's voice of God in the hugo ceremony I believe so.

419
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,280
 But like I would have just had the voice the narrator of the ceremony it outs the winners

420
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,840
 because you could have saved so much time if you hadn't you would have reduced the risk of

421
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,160
 something going wrong because we did go wrong it has started late and you could have made it a

422
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,120
 lot snappier if you hadn't had George sitting in his theater doing the actual opening envelopes.

423
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:12,240
 I think the actual tech was extremely complicated and and they were very they were all exhausted

424
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,920
 and and very happy that they'd actually managed to hold all the technical bits of it together.

425
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,720
 I think I think I agree with John I think if you've made it so complicated that all your energy is

426
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,280
 going into making sure your complicated tech works and you need to take a step back and say okay

427
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,520
 this is where our people points are going is this where they should actually be going.

428
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,920
 I am very much with you that they should have basically pre-recorded everything apart from

429
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,280
 if you knew you were going to have an acceptance speech live I think that was nice to have because

430
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,520
 it was really nice to have those kind of on the spot acceptances but if that was also complicated

431
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,680
 just record everyone's speeches edit it into one thing and just play it because there were quite a

432
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,600
 lot of you know moments where it didn't quite cut back and forth nicely moments where it didn't

433
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:06,240
 quite sound as good even if you had to record George like the day before reading out all the

434
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,040
 winners and then edit that in quickly I think that might just have been easier because then

435
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,600
 you would also know okay so we have no speeches in here from the winners and it is already two

436
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,800
 and a half hours long you know we would know by that point that you have a problem.

437
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,960
 Yeah oh it is certainly true that the Worldcon knew in advance that they had they could kind of

438
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:34,000
 see a slow motion car crash around the Hugo's and it actually I realize now was overshadowing

439
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,720
 some of the things that people were doing earlier in the convention and I think my favorite example

440
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,040
 of this is that on about the Tuesday after the Worldcon don't I mean you can check the date

441
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:55,520
 "discon" announced the hosts of the Hugo ceremony next year and they had a splash they said

442
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,480
 "here are Hugo announced here are Hugo's hosts we're announcing it today" and what I learned in chat

443
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,320
 sorry for telling tales out of school is that this announcement had been planned before

444
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,320
 Conzeland so "discon" knew before Conzeland that announcing

445
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,760
 apparently completely unproblematic Hugo hosts the day after Conzeland was going to be a really

446
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,560
 really good thing to do so it's not that people didn't know there was a problem. I have one more

447
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:33,680
 thing to add which is for many many years Robert Silver would stand up and talk out the Hugo's

448
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,600
 he has not for several years and there was a decision made obviously this year to invite him

449
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:48,160
 back and he added 15 maybe 20 minutes it seemed like of just kind of very rambling chat mostly

450
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:56,000
 about John W Campbell so even if you found it very hard to say to Martin okay we need to shorten

451
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 your links there too long this is going to be very long at some points on my decision that they

452
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,480
 would give a massive chunk of the Hugo ceremony over to someone where basically it would be known

453
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,640
 what he does which has taught for a very long time and that seemed a very baffling decision to me

454
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,720
 I mean I believe that Bob I believe that Bob Silverberg is the only person left who has attended

455
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,200
 every Worldcon I mean I'm going to do the thing about the reason why we are told to honor our elders

456
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,680
 is that it is sometimes difficult now I don't I would not have given him space at the Hugo ceremony

457
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:39,040
 but I do think that clearly I see that what happened is that George wanted to do it and George

458
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,400
 wanted to involve Bob and George wanted to hop back to the old days yeah and and you can see why

459
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,720
 if you're in this big community that seems very disparate if you're an old man it probably seems

460
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,680
 enormously disparate compared to the times that it was just you and your mates in the bar and

461
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,640
 and you can see that old people would have a lot of nostalgia for when everyone knew everyone

462
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,960
 and helping people understand that there are some merits to having a broader community where

463
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,800
 not everybody knows everybody else and not everybody does that that doesn't necessarily be

464
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,920
 that's a bad thing I think you're right I think you know he may be the only person who has been to

465
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,400
 every Worldcon and we do need to find a way to recognize that but I just don't think the way to

466
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,800
 recognize that is to have quite a long segment of the Hugo's and it particularly wasn't even a

467
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,720
 segment that seemed to kind of link his whole history with Worldcon together it seemed to be

468
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,920
 a segment which talked about things very much in the past and this was really my problem with the

469
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,920
 whole thing is if you're going to do Worldcon history I want you to do that in a way that links

470
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,680
 it up to the present and future of the Hugo's and this just didn't do it it seemed to kind of stop

471
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,880
 at the point where they sort of stopped maybe enjoying Worldcon so much I mean I think my final

472
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,840
 comment on it is the comment I made about 10 minutes into the ceremony where I said something like

473
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,800
 you haven't missed anything yet he's still rambling on and that was still true three hours later

474
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,160
 when I went back to sleep I was about five minutes into the ceremony I was in a zoom chat with

475
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,400
 an opera very interesting people and we watched the ceremony in about five minutes in the first

476
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,520
 it was like when you're a thunderstorm is about to start or that it is not raining and then you

477
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,440
 just feel a drop of rain and somebody made a comment and then somebody else did and then it was just

478
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:34,640
 like a torrent of oh my goodness how is this happening with a certain amount of yeah well we

479
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,120
 can't do this it's going to be what happened but but it was it was embarrassing for the Worldcon

480
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:45,600
 and it was it was embarrassing for the Worldcon we want to be and can I also say that the retrohugos

481
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,800
 are an abomination and it should not be they should people should stop doing them they certainly

482
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,280
 shouldn't increase the number of years for which they could be done this is another I'm looking at

483
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,120
 wussfuss here because this is something where wussfuss extended the range of years for which

484
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,960
 retrohugos could be awarded making it so now you can award a retrohugo for a a Worldcon where

485
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,560
 there wasn't even a Worldcon and oh god and that's what leads us to this I think I have previously

486
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,920
 made my opinions on the retrohugos no one on this podcast which is let's just stop now no no

487
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,520
 they should never have started time it was a terrible appalling idea anyway why I quite like

488
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,120
 them but uh I'm not gonna I'm not I don't feel strongly enough about it to defend that against

489
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:36,240
 the disagreement uh but if you are listening to this also thinking I quite like them you are

490
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,400
 not alone why do you why do you quite like them John just did they kind of neat I said I told

491
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,840
 you I don't have a good argument I understand I understand all the problems with them the problem

492
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:56,720
 with me is that my default state is quite liking things uh and that is difficult um whereas my

493
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,120
 default state is loathing for everything that has not yet proved itself worthwhile I mean I'm not

494
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,760
 trying to imply that but I am thinking it very loudly.

495
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:14,000
 "Etheism of the New Things" quickly followed by Disenchantment and Rage. Disenchantment and Rage is

496
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,480
 the name of your um next fanzine. Is that the new name of your sex tape John it's the name of your

497
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,560
 next fanzine. It's my podcast appropriate phone. I'm not sure that Disenchantment and Rage is the

498
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:39,840
 name of your sex tape. Um and I am not sure that Delving Deeper into the

499
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:56,480
 reconvened 2020 uh it was a convention. Blinking you'll miss it. It was a flashcon.

500
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,200
 I mean have a bit of a lie in or be doing something else for a couple of hours and it's gone.

501
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,320
 It turns out six hours long. Five hours long? Six hours long? Something in that region?

502
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:13,360
 Liz did you go to reconvened 2020? No uh because as as stateless podcasts many times there are

503
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,520
 many good things about virtual events and you can join them from around the world but reconvened

504
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:26,080
 2020 was exactly 12 hours behind my time zone and so I think it took place between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.

505
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:31,520
 so no I don't love conventions enough to stay up literally all night while on my holidays.

506
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:42,320
 It um that is a good that is a fair comment here it started at 4 p.m. and went until 11 p.m.

507
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:48,560
 10 p.m. I think it was 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time yes. Portal 10 for us. That's good beer drinking

508
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:55,600
 time. It was um and Oi went and I believe Alison also went. They had some apparently

509
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:01,680
 excellent panels with excellent people on who in fact I did quite want to see but because I was

510
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,080
 doing something else with some other people I I missed the Ted Chang one which was the one I

511
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:13,920
 particularly wanted to go to because I've never actually heard him speak and um and then they were

512
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,360
 all just kind of panels and I was like well you know panels and then they flowed into discussions

513
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:25,040
 in chat which I I understand were quite good discussions in chat um which were also happening

514
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,160
 during the panels as well as as after the panels and they were discord fan tables um and I spent

515
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,600
 some time hanging out in discord fan tables most notably the Glasgow table but I mean my comment on

516
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:47,840
 text chat is is party like it's nighty nighty night and um I feel like I feel like text chat does

517
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,120
 not do it for me and they didn't they had discord chat tables but again because I was doing other

518
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:00,080
 things involving zoom that weekend every time I try to run discord video I have to reboot my

519
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,520
 computer before zoom will ever work again and and that is very tedious so I I would have definitely

520
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,040
 joined a discord table if there'd been somebody I really wanted to talk to on it but there kind of

521
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,960
 wasn't um and in fact there weren't that many people there were only maybe typically 20 or 25

522
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,240
 people on on discord chat tables and in it you know in the in the audio and video um and as always

523
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:30,720
 I'm at several different conventions this weekend and one of the other ones is um the stereoscopic

524
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,760
 photography convention which is is despite the fact that it is mostly old white dudes they are

525
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,640
 enthusiastically embracing new technology because 3d they are testing out a thing called high fidelity

526
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:50,640
 where you can wander around an audio map and and see a cluster of people and then find yourself

527
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,520
 in an audio chat with those people which you will not be able to hear if you move away from them

528
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,160
 I think this is an intro I want to try this out with a bunch of my mates but it is only audio

529
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,840
 rather than video so we we we kind of I still don't think the perfect answer exists but anyway

530
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,080
 so it wasn't social enough for me there was no there were no zoom parties I like zoom parties

531
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:17,200
 so um yeah so um I went to reconvene I saw the Ted Chang panel it was um very good that was the

532
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,560
 panel I ran away from the zoom that I was in with you and Claire and Mark to go and see

533
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:30,560
 I was very interesting I do find I think I agree with you I'm not I did not find the discord for

534
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,800
 reconvene was particularly compelling it if if that I have been to online conventions where the

535
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:43,840
 discord has been compelling um but I found that the reconvene was perhaps not busy enough or not

536
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,880
 very enough or there was something about it that just I didn't really it was fun I was fine I was

537
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,560
 checking it but like it didn't feel like it was replacing the social aspect of a real con for me

538
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:02,720
 um and I remember what you said um last episode about conzeland having kind of eight hour blocks

539
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,080
 so you um you suggested that it would have been a good idea to have like five hours of panels

540
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,600
 and three hours of parties and then repeat and I do wonder whether reconvene would have been better

541
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,760
 because they had six hours of panels which seems like an appropriate number of panels

542
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,680
 then if they'd just had two hours of parties at the end the party was decided at 10 finished a

543
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,720
 bit night for me um and then I could have got to bed and I would have gotten all of the the

544
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,000
 socializing with with different fans uh uh around the world but they are test surrounding options

545
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,160
 for boss scone and there's a limit to how much convention they could pull together in a very

546
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,360
 short time because reconvene was pulled together very quickly I think the the plan would be to to

547
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:49,600
 expand the social spaces I mean they certainly knew that they weren't as focused on on party on

548
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:56,000
 generating parties as as other cons might be in general I think the model of having like a short

549
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,760
 convention which is maybe sort of eight to nine hours long which is kind of five hours of of

550
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:08,080
 panel and programming and then kind of three hours of of socializing and parties is a a model I

551
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,360
 would like to see become a thing where you can just you know you and a few mates if you're an author

552
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,640
 or even if you're a fan my own fan run conventions that did this um you know to put on you know maybe

553
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:25,840
 two or three streams of five panels, sots and then do a big zoom with breakout rooms at the end

554
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,240
 for people to come and just chat you know did you see that panel that was good wasn't it and I've

555
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,680
 got a beer where do you come from you know like in regular convention bars and that would have

556
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,960
 very good so I do think that they could have it would have been almost perfect with just like

557
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,080
 you know a couple of hours of zoom on the end but but remembering that the zoom model is still

558
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:49,280
 not a great model for parties and I'm I am still looking for alternatives that make socializing

559
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:57,040
 better what we need is we need discord to have the zoom video features if discord could buy zoom

560
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:03,360
 or zoom could buy discord whichever is richer and then just fold all the good bits are both perfect

561
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:09,200
 okay so so it's not uncommon for amalgamations of this kind to end up with all the bad bits of

562
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:16,160
 both yes that is a very good point and again we come to the fundamental difference in our looks um

563
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,040
 no yes they yeah I mean I am mostly being facetious but I think if discord had better um

564
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:27,440
 video and kind of live socializing options I do think yeah I mean discord does show you who's in

565
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,560
 which chat which is the critical critical thing people want to be able to look at clusters of

566
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:39,760
 people and go oh gosh Bertie Smith is in that cluster I haven't seen him since 1924 we could

567
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,800
 talk about how shocking it is that they changed the name of the John W. Campbell award okay so

568
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,680
 but I don't think this is also I'm going to talk a little bit about the difference between

569
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:56,000
 British and US outlooks on conventions because it's not it's not uncommon for American conventions

570
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,120
 to not really have any space where you could socialize in the way that the British socialize in the bar

571
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:10,800
 to the extent that people the same people who are worried about um problematic things in

572
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,760
 conventions often say that one of the things that is problematic about conventions is the bar

573
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,200
 which speaking of somebody who holds up in the bar at the second they arrive at the convention

574
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:27,920
 and and can only be winkled out by by biological imperatives um I'm slightly worried about this

575
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,240
 but I do understand that there is an issue about alcohol and its relationship to fun that the

576
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,280
 British may have a bigger interest a bigger problem with um maybe we should have this as a topic for

577
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:51,040
 a future episode. The weekend of the 21st to the 23rd of August is NASFIC the US national

578
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,760
 science fiction convention which is held in years where the world con is held outside the US

579
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,600
 obviously because the internet is um in some ways outside the US NASFIC is happening this year

580
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:07,520
 and so um Alison I believe it's going to be on the program and she's going to be talking about her

581
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,120
 guff trip do you want to tell us a little bit about that Alison? Well I'm hoping to be talking

582
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:17,280
 about my guff trip but it is very much the very first cut of a talk that I have additionally offered

583
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:24,240
 to Futuricon where I really will be that'll be October and I hope that by that point I will have

584
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:30,000
 a proper presentation where I talk for half an hour and then take questions about my guff trip

585
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,800
 but this one's much going to be much closer to I have a list of bullet points and I'll talk for

586
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,400
 half an hour and then take questions. Nice! Um but it won't be I won't have worked it up properly um

587
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:47,600
 I got very much looking forward to it um it's got a more global um reach than it normally does

588
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:54,880
 because online um it turns out that shifting your body clock five hours late so that you can

589
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,640
 get up at noon and go to bed at five o'clock in the morning is it's not that hard compared to

590
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:07,040
 going to New Zealand um and I'm hoping it'll be good again I will obviously be looking at it

591
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,480
 from the point of view of how is it managing its social spaces because really how is convention

592
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,800
 how are conventions managing their social spaces is the thing I'm more interested in than anything

593
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:22,240
 else right now um because I don't think it will be to get in purpose person for a good while.

594
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:27,520
 Next weekend I am going to virtually Expo which is the online edition of the UK Games Expo

595
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,240
 I am going to be playing Arkham Horror with Liz as part of that convention um Liz won't be out

596
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,800
 the convention but she will be playing Arkham Horror with me while I am at the convention so she'll

597
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:42,800
 sort of be one degree of Kevin Bacon from the convention one degree of Bob Silverberg.

598
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:48,080
 Is this technically ghosting or is this more kind of some weird tentacled version of a ghost?

599
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:55,920
 Ha ha ha no the UK Games Expo is free except for role-playing games so um you don't there's no

600
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,560
 really there's no real way to ghost um but yes yeah no I have a membership though I'm not

601
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:09,600
 I am not certain how much was the weekend it's my nieces eighteeth's birthday next weekend and we're

602
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:15,840
 going to an actually not socially distanced family party it is going to be outdoors but I think the

603
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,320
 garden that's being held in the number of people who go which is not that mainly like about 20

604
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,360
 could not literally fit in a socially distanced way into that garden which is about the size of

605
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:31,600
 this study. I think I would say I am technically going to UK Games Expo but only to play this one

606
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:38,640
 Arkham Horror game and someone in the Arkham Horror game has to do all the complicated bits

607
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,360
 and that will be John. It will I'm looking forward to it and we are definitely going to do

608
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:50,800
 Octa Thought plays Arkham Horror as a as an episode that we can drop in sometime when we can't record.

609
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:57,040
 Yes we're committing to it now this is all going in the episode um so you heard it here

610
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,240
 first folks are we are we going to do that I think it would be fun what do I need to do I need

611
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,000
 to buy something to make that happen or can we just do it with kind of online versions or what

612
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,360
 you need to buy tabletop simulator uh huh okay send me send me links I mean it's just going to be

613
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,120
 two hours of Alice in asking questions and then we'll make that and then we'll have to find a

614
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,280
 date for that because it can't be a regular recording time because if we do it at a regular

615
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,440
 recording time it will not fulfill the function of being an extra episode that we can drop in

616
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,160
 in an emergency and we could when we when we draw the podcast we could also like do a youtube

617
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:36,480
 video so you can see the pictures if you want to okay so that was the 12th episode of the Octa

618
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,920
 Thorpe podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me the

619
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,760
 theme music for this episode was fanfare for space by kevin mccloud at ncompetech.com

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,640
 but can I can I mention my anecdote about podcast editing what because I want to get this in and

622
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,000
 jonak and use it a lot of new chooses which is that I happened to listen to the unedited version

623
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,160
 of my favorite podcast the other day um I did this because they recorded a day late which meant

624
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:23,600
 that when I was accustomed to listening to it it wasn't there so I went and grabbed the the

625
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:30,000
 members only live bootleg and they spent for example 20 minutes talking about what they were going

626
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,880
 to discuss things in and honestly I have huge support there for everybody who edits podcasts

627
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:43,440
 that's what I always do but um it it it is an amazingly entertaining podcast that was much less

628
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,240
 entertaining in the not edited version this is one of the reasons why um and this will go in the

629
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,280
 after show but this is one of the reasons why whenever there's a podcast that's like you can

630
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,680
 subscribe and get access to the unedited version it's like yeah because I want to pay you money to

631
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,600
 make your product worse it'd be like if apple said you compare a section grounded you have to make

632
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,040
 the computer I'd be like nah you're all right I'll pay the less money for the better thing

633
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,080
 it doesn't I understand that it's like an easy way and I understand why they do it and I'm not

634
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,120
 criticizing them at all but I've never been a USB for me at all because I'm like yeah editing

635
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,720
 yeah but I did want to listen to it on Friday morning so there's that yeah that's fair I tried

636
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,680
 it with do do the right thing have a podcast uh a patreon tier where you can get the edited

637
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,480
 podcast and I tried it and I was like oh no the editing does make it better I shall just listen to

638
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:34,880
 the edited versions I have been to see I'm sorry I have a declue being recorded oh yes and I can

639
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,920
 confirm that although these are very funny people who are professionally funny and famous for it

640
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,840
 it is still much better on the radio yes so I listened to I listened to I'm just gonna put my

641
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:51,280
 anecdote in here nice I listened to a cycling podcast and during the grand tours they do a daily

642
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:57,040
 episode and the you know the stage will finish for the day at maybe five p.m and usually the

643
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:03,360
 episode would have been out by you know 11 p.m so somehow these guys record an episode and it gets

644
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:09,280
 edited in like five hours flat and I don't know whether they just naturally sit down and do you

645
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:16,480
 know 45 minutes of coherent stuff that doesn't require editing or the editors of magic but either

646
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,280
 way there's some magic involved there to get that done and I'm you know now I have a podcast I'm even

647
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,880
 more impressed about how good it sounds.
