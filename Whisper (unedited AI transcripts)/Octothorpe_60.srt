1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
 So way back in episode one, um, this is the point where you can put the way back music, John, that you've got on the...

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:29,920
 [

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
 I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty.

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:47,920
 Good Lord, you all have a lot of opinions about Monster Munch. We are not going to go through all of them here, but we really respected the amount of attention you all gave that on Facebook.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,920
 Apparently you all like Monster Munch a lot.

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,920
 Um, over on Twitter, someone sent us a chart of comment or a cock.

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,920
 [laughs] No, no, no, no, no, no.

9
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,920
 Too far, John. Too far.

10
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,920
 So Hugo Book Club wrote to us saying a very quick note for accuracy.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:18,920
 Um, I think I said that Fancast was the category with the lowest participation, and they sent a graph showing participation rates in the at-risk categories, and Fancast is sometimes the lowest, but is not always.

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,920
 I do recommend going and checking out that graph, and we will put a link in the show notes.

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:31,920
 I discovered that Peter Sullivan once used a Monster Munch as an engagement ring because the bar didn't have any hula hoops.

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
 I'm just feeling sorry for the Americans who are like, "What does that mean?"

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,920
 There's not a nouns there, but I know what.

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 Uh, so yeah, if you're listening, Laurie, and the Hugo Girl people, uh, we will explain it to you at Worldcon.

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
 Yeah, I might manage to bring some hula hoops in my luggage.

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,920
 It won't make more sense, but you'll know what it means.

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,920
 I almost want all the details from Peter, but I also kind of want it to remain, you know, the rest of the story to remain a mystery.

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,920
 Except Peter, please write in to say what you used as a wedding ring.

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,920
 [laughs]

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
 Well, he used Rose Bee for the engagement, so presumably we'd pick old onion for the wedding.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 Both Kevin Stambly and Tammy Coxon wrote to us about NASFIC voting.

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:22,920
 Thank you very much both. Kevin basically noted on Twitter that there have been previous cases where NASFICs have selected NASFICs

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:30,920
 because the lead times for Worldcons used to be different, which is something I don't think we picked up on.

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,920
 But basically it didn't used to have to be that there was Worldcon consecutively, because obviously the bid process used to take three years, not two.

27
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:44,920
 And so it happened in 1987 when voters at CactusCon in Phoenix chose the site of the 1990 NASFIC.

28
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,920
 Thank you both for writing in.

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,920
 Yeah, Chris Garcia sent us a letter of comment. Thank you very much.

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,920
 Chris, he says he is the gloomy dark rain cow, cloud, hanging over fandom, old bother.

31
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,920
 Sorry, Chris, try eating some pickled onion, monster munch, and you'll perk right up.

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
 We'll bring you some, Chris, don't worry.

33
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,920
 Oh yeah, and he also mentions sci-fi London short film program, which is fantastic.

34
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:17,920
 And yes, I don't think I got a word in on this one last time, but I went to many sci-fi London short film programs when I lived in London or thereabouts, and they were fantastic.

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,920
 Maybe I'll even put a link to some of my favourites in the show notes if I can remember which ones they were.

36
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:31,920
 Also, he is surprised that Alison is short, so apparently either Chris is short and doesn't know it, or maybe Alison's personality just makes her seem like a tall person

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
 through sheer force of will.

38
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
 Poor Cain, no lost doors.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,920
 Chris is, Chris is like, he's not a tall man, I wouldn't say, but Alison is also taller personality than stature.

40
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
 Not a tall man.

41
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,920
 Alison is also not a tall man, that is true.

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:54,920
 This is something that people are often very surprised to discover how short I am, but I make up for it in a width.

43
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,920
 I wouldn't say volume, but...

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:07,920
 On Friday, I was on a Zoom with Alison, and there was a point at which Steven took a phone and recorded Alison doing something, and I had not seen Alison from Steven's vantage point before, and it is bloody brilliant.

45
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,920
 I highly recommend anyone get Steven to carry a camera around when he's with Alison and watch, because he is 10/10, would win a Hugo.

46
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,920
 And what was I doing and why was I doing it, John?

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:26,920
 You were making a Zaziki and beer smoothie with ice, because I said I'd pay you a favour if you did it and drank it, and you did it and drank it, and then I'd say, "I'm not a fan of it."

48
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,920
 And then I owed you a favour.

49
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,920
 And it was, "Let me tell you, spending a favour for that level of entertainment, highly recommend."

50
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
 It was pretty good.

51
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,920
 Anyone who's at a convention, bring a favour and some Zaziki and corner Alison in the bar.

52
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 World's calm.

53
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
 You know?

54
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
 Please don't.

55
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
 Are we good?

56
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
 Everyone do that, please.

57
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
 Please don't.

58
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,920
 But secondly, I did eventually watch all of the Sci-Fi London short films.

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
 There was a brief hitch.

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,920
 I think we might have mentioned it on the podcast last time, where the website had broken on the day.

61
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
 I was going to finish them off.

62
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,920
 But it was back up when running the next eight, so we watched them, and it was very good.

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,920
 And I generally enjoyed all the others I watched as well.

64
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
 But we already talked about it in some detail.

65
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,920
 But Liz, I forgot you used to live in the UK and went to UK things.

66
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,920
 I was like, "Oh yeah, Liz was near London once."

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
 I was.

68
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,920
 I've never done, I've kind of ignored Sci-Fi London, except once or twice I've been to things on the Sci-Fi.

69
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,920
 London programme, and it's been good.

70
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,920
 But I feel like I should do more of Sci-Fi London than I do.

71
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,920
 But that's, I feel like I should do more of everything than I do.

72
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,920
 How do people find time for things, people?

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
 It's difficult.

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,920
 Leicester used to have a great film festival every year, which was zombie-focused.

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:51,920
 And so I have seen a surprising number of classic zombie films, especially considering my view of cinema in general.

76
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,920
 My view of zombie cinema is much better than my view of almost all other cinema.

77
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
 Run by a book called Zombie Ed.

78
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,920
 The thing about Sci-Fi London is some of the longer films could be hit and miss.

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
 I mean, the short films can as well.

80
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,920
 But in the short film programme, you usually got kind of a mix of quite good ones, some terrible ones, some mediocre ones.

81
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,920
 Whereas if you picked randomly four films, you might randomly pick four mediocre ones.

82
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,920
 So I thought it was a very good chance to see something really good.

83
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,920
 But then of course, if you did see a really good film, then it was brilliant.

84
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,920
 One of the things that is great about short film programmes is that if you absolutely hate something, there'll be something else to log in ten minutes, and I like that a lot.

85
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
 Exactly.

86
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:37,920
 One other thing Chris mentions in his lock is that we definitely have a listener in South America, which is very exciting.

87
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:48,920
 So Chris says that his friend, Jules, lived in California for decades, but has moved to Brazil and says he listens to the podcast last time.

88
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
 Chris spoke to him.

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
 So we have a South American listener.

90
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
 Yes.

91
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
 Hello, Jules.

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,920
 So now we need Africa and Antarctica and Asia, who is not Liz.

93
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
 And then we get the full set.

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
 Yes.

95
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,920
 To be fair, I do have colleagues on Antarctica, so I could ask them to listen, but is that cheating?

96
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,920
 Do you have colleagues on Antarctica, John?

97
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:15,920
 Like sporadically, because obviously you don't just live there, but yeah, like I've got colleagues who have went to Antarctica.

98
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
 They have great photos.

99
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
 So yeah, you should definitely do that.

100
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,920
 Do you ever have colleagues in space?

101
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,920
 Not yet.

102
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,920
 If you're listening to what's a thought from space, we really, really want to shout out.

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
 Thank you.

104
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:42,920
 So the Brigitte Bradshaw wrote to us, she put the phrase cover art for Octa thought podcast into the artificial intelligence image maker, Dali.

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,920
 And she describes the result as weirdly pleasing.

106
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,920
 We have used it as our show art this episode.

107
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:57,920
 She says, I don't know what it's drawing from, except for the Sumason, which I think is probably the left, the left column in the middle.

108
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,920
 I think might be coming from the punctuation art in part, because it's that black and white.

109
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,920
 It was very cool. So thank you very much, Brigitte. That was a great lock.

110
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
 It is, I find it strangely beautiful.

111
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,920
 And it's all, it's gone very much with a sort of pink and yellow and blue colour scheme somehow.

112
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
 Apart from one which is black and white.

113
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
 And sometimes we're like shadowy figures.

114
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
 Yeah.

115
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
 If they're supposed to be us.

116
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
 Like the Illuminati.

117
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,920
 If you just put Octa thought in, Liz discovered you basically get C-n-n-me.

118
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,920
 I don't know what about us is C-n-n-me like.

119
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
 But.

120
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,920
 Yeah, I mean, I was thinking I'd just get, you know, hashtags.

121
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,920
 Yeah, yeah. It's very clearly keying off Octa and not off Thorpe.

122
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
 Hmm.

123
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
 Hmm.

124
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
 Interestingly.

125
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
 But I don't know why.

126
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
 But yes. Thank you very much, Brigitte.

127
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,920
 Oh, and my Brad W. Foster original arrived in the post and it's very nice and I get very, very much.

128
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
 And obviously it's at home and I'm not.

129
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
 So I can't show you it. Sorry.

130
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
 I'll show you the next time.

131
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,920
 Oh, and also there was a lock from episode one we were going to deal with and I'll let Alison introduce it.

132
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,920
 So way back in episode one.

133
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:23,920
 Um, Catherine Crockett said, please can you do transcripts of Octa Thorpe and we took that very seriously and so now here on episode 60 of Octa Thorpe we now have transcripts.

134
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,920
 We've got transcripts of episodes 57 to 59 and we're going to do the rest in our copious free time.

135
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,920
 If you listen to Octa Thorpe on the Podbean player, it's got the embedded subtitles in SRT format.

136
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,920
 They don't work propagated to your podcast thing.

137
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:52,920
 So if you need subtitles, you can either download the SRT subtitles and put them into your podcast, your listening solution or you can listen on Podbean, both of those work.

138
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,920
 We sync transcripts will normally be about a week after the podcast or up to a week after the podcast.

139
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:12,920
 We'll see how it goes because it's still a very manual, despite the fact that auto auto transcribes the episode, it makes a lot of mistakes and we like to correct the most egregious of those before we put it online.

140
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:37,920
 And we have a new Octa Thorpe page on efansies.com and the link is in the show notes and you can find there the text files, the transcript and also the subtitle files so that you can put it into whatever you use to listen to the podcast and also the second edition, a mended edition of an immutable artifact which is a Hugo Verti Packet submission.

141
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,920
 And all of this is thanks to Bill Burns, who has put the page up for us.

142
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
 I mean the transcripts are thanks to us because we've done them.

143
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,920
 We think transcripts are important for accessibility.

144
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,920
 So thank you for nudging us, Catherine, and we've done it now and it's great.

145
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,920
 You say, wait, it's mostly Alison doing the transcript. Thank you, Alison.

146
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:08,920
 Alison is doing most of the transcripts. Thank you, Alison, because this is a hugely tedious job that would drive me absolutely mad.

147
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,920
 So I'm very in awe that Alison has taken it on.

148
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,920
 So thanks to John for doing the editing, which is a hugely tedious job that would drive me mad.

149
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,920
 The key in any successful partnership is to find people who like different forms of tedium.

150
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,920
 My dad has a theory of this with marriages. He's like, you need someone who likes cooking and someone who likes washing up.

151
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,920
 And I think that you can generalise that into creative partnerships in a number of ways.

152
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,920
 And Liz's favourite form of tedium is sitting on beautiful beaches whilst reading books.

153
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,920
 Oh, shots fired, shots fired.

154
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
 Liz, do you have a response?

155
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,920
 Look, if we need any octa-thorps spreadsheets doing, I'm totally on it.

156
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,920
 Oh, that is true. Liz has. And you have done spreadsheets for us previously.

157
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,920
 You've knocked up a graph or two in your time for previous issues.

158
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
 Episode.

159
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,920
 So listeners, if you could think of some data you'd like processing for octa-thorps, do let us know and we'll get Liz on it.

160
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
 There.

161
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:23,920
 Johnathan Cowie sent us a letter of comment which we are going to treat as a full segment.

162
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
 We think it was an interesting question.

163
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:34,920
 And he asks, what special Hugo Award would we introduce if we were in charge of doing that at Glasgow in 2024?

164
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,920
 Assuming, of course, touching wood that Glasgow were to be successful in becoming the world con

165
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,920
 when we vote for them in Chicago.

166
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,920
 I think Glasgow is now the air presumptive for the world con, isn't it?

167
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
 Or maybe even the air apparent?

168
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,920
 Yeah, but I could still get a right in bid going for Alison's house if I wanted.

169
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
 Do not even think about it.

170
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,920
 Yes, listeners, you heard it here first.

171
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,920
 Wolfamstow 2024. Right, but...

172
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,920
 I feel like Bangkok 2024 would be a lot more fun.

173
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
 Oh, that's true actually Liz. Let's put the world in world con.

174
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:19,920
 So the question is, what special Hugo would we introduce if we were in charge of Glasgow 2024, which we're definitely not?

175
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,920
 And my suggestion is best transcript.

176
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,920
 I think it's just 10/10 idea.

177
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:34,920
 I think there needs to be more recognition of transcripts in the podcast space and we have better art in our transcript than some other transcripts.

178
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
 So I think we were shoeing.

179
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,920
 Well, we did do. Yeah, maybe sort of.

180
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,920
 I've now discovered that it's much better to have your transcripts as a plain text file, so that's what we're doing going forward.

181
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
 But yes, the only use of a lot of factors of fanzine.

182
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,920
 But it is not eligible for the best fanzine, Hugo, obviously.

183
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
 Hugo, Liz.

184
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:05,920
 Chicago. So I should say here I am assuming that between now and 2024 we have already passed the proposal to have the best video games you go, because if we haven't done that, then I would tell you.

185
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,920
 The best video game in my head would be an awesome Hugo, but you probably don't want to know.

186
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,920
 Can I have a Hugo for Best Vivid Dream?

187
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
 No, don't tell us.

188
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,920
 Liz, you made us out like...

189
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,920
 I had a very vivid dream the other day that Stuart Prawns, and I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to do this."

190
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,920
 I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to do this."

191
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,920
 I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to do this."

192
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,920
 Liz, you made us out like...

193
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,920
 I had a very vivid dream the other day that Stuart Prawns Dad was very old.

194
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
 That was the end. That was just the dream.

195
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,920
 Just a single, super vivid image of a very old man.

196
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,920
 I mean, presumably Stuart Prawns Dad is quite old.

197
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,920
 But I was imagining him in like 95, and Stuart Prawns Dad is actually what I would describe as a dillf.

198
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,920
 See, this is getting into the disturbing regions that I was not going into.

199
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
 Yes, exactly. This is why we're not doing it right.

200
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,920
 This is both disturbing and cricket content, so I think it should be banned on two grounds.

201
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
 Yes.

202
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
 Liz and I discussed, um...

203
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
 Liz's views on cricket content on the podcast.

204
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,920
 Er, I have views. There should be more of it.

205
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,920
 Yep, she was absolutely... she was like, "You and... you and Josh should start having a cricket segment."

206
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
 Yes!

207
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:25,920
 Yes, assuming we only have a best game Hugo on the list, and assuming that I could come around to the position that there should be even more Hugo's,

208
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,920
 because the moment I'm not convinced we shouldn't have any more, it's getting out of hand.

209
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,920
 But assuming all that, I would then have one, I think, for best nonfiction.

210
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
 Mmm.

211
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,920
 Since this is my own, you know, make believe Hugo, I would probably define that quite broadly.

212
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,920
 So you could have essays, you could have books, you could have reviews, you could have academic works.

213
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,920
 I mean, you could probably have nonfiction video essays in there as well.

214
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:59,920
 Basically, the whole thing, a lot of the stuff that ends up kind of in-best related, but maybe make it more specifically focused on non-fictional content.

215
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,920
 A bit more like the kind of BSFA awards nonfiction award, which I think works very nicely,

216
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,920
 although I would exclude podcasts maybe from the Hugo non-best nonfiction, I would say that.

217
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:19,920
 So I'm thinking of things like, you know, I often look in semi-prosines and I enjoy, you know, voting for strange horizons.

218
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,920
 Maybe not even primarily because of their fiction, but because I really like a lot of their nonfiction essays and reviews,

219
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,920
 and it would be nice to have somewhere to reward particularly good examples of that form.

220
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
 Mmm.

221
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,920
 So would you do best non-fictional best criticism?

222
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,920
 I don't know. I think I'd have to look up how I kind of defined it because the other problem is with a Hugo.

223
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,920
 You kind of, the problem is that best related work is a big grab bag.

224
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,920
 So you'd want to be able to carve off a chunk of what would be best related work and make it best non-fictional best criticism.

225
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,920
 I might make it best criticism and then like the voters can define criticism.

226
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,920
 So that could include like straightforward reviews or it could include, you know, critical essays and things like that that aren't focused on any specific work.

227
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,920
 But it could include, you know, things like strange horizons around table discussions, you know, or long form.

228
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,920
 There's a lot of long form video essays out there out there now about generally criticism of various media properties from different angles.

229
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:26,920
 I think it kind of includes all of those in it. But maybe try and avoid non-fiction things like, you know, author interviews and certainly things like that do fit in better-related art books and so on would not be in this category.

230
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:34,920
 I'm not sure why. I mean, I feel like professional non-fiction podcasts on the theme probably would fit in here.

231
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
 Yeah. I mean, I'd say like...

232
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
 I mean, I'm not sure if there are any.

233
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,920
 Yeah, I'm trying to think of an example of one. I'm sure there are ones that I would fit in.

234
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,920
 Like, I mean, Hugo Girl in a Way is a critical discussion of a different book each time and therefore would fit in.

235
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,920
 But I mean, I might try and say, well, there is already a thing for fan podcasts that would fit better in there.

236
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:05,920
 I mean, it's not a professional thing though. I mean, I think there isn't really a good space for professional podcasts, which is one of the things that I'd be getting to in my suggestion when we get to it.

237
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
 So, yeah.

238
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
 Oh, sorry. You said specifically professional, didn't you?

239
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
 Yeah, I'd just say professional.

240
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:17,920
 Because I think fan criticism is definitely covered by fan cast because clearly it's part of what we do and it's part of what lots of other fan casts do.

241
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,920
 I mean, one possible professional thing is, you know, you get TV shows which have accompanying podcasts,

242
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,920
 which I've quite enjoyed, and maybe some of those would fit into that sort of area.

243
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,920
 One thing I would say is, like, on the subject of professional criticism,

244
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:41,920
 obviously, the lines here are slightly blurry because, like, I would argue that, for instance, upcoming conversation guest of honor, Neil Harrison.

245
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,920
 If Neil Harrison had a podcast in which he criticized books, like, I would say that's probably more on the professional end,

246
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:58,920
 despite the fact that I don't think he'd be getting paid for it because, like, obviously he was editor of Strange Horizons for ages and he is incredibly knowledgeable in a way that when I talk about how much I like moon night, I'm maybe not.

247
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,920
 And so there's, like, there's a semi-pro kind of problem here, isn't there?

248
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:11,920
 But basically what I want to say before Alison responds is, Abigail and Neil, please do a criticism podcast. I will listen to the shit out of that.

249
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
 Uh-uh. Sorry, going.

250
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
 Oh, God, that would be so good.

251
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
 It would be very, very good.

252
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
 You should have to edit it, John.

253
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
 Ooh.

254
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,920
 No, I don't think I think that would be difficult.

255
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,920
 Edit down someone else's three-hour argument, John.

256
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:49,920
 I would also say, yeah, one thing I did think about is suggesting this for Glasgow is I think there's quite a lot of interesting work coming out of, you know, from UK-based writers and things like, you know, Vecta for the Biersefais got a lot of good stuff in recently, so it would be a nice one to have at Glasgow, assuming there was a slightly more British

257
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,920
 tilt to the nominations, which may be completely wrong.

258
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:05,920
 I mean, best criticism would be great because I do think, and I know this is my patriotic prejudice that a lot of the particularly good critics are British or have come out of British fandom.

259
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
 I think it's something we do quite well.

260
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
 Oh, that's fair.

261
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,920
 Well, I think, maybe I'm talking about my butt here, but is there an equivalent?

262
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:25,920
 I feel like the science fiction foundation and the BSFA both do quite a lot for kind of science fiction, criticism and commentary, and is there a similar American body to those two that focuses on that side of SF?

263
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,920
 I'm blanking on it if there is one.

264
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 I mean, something like New York Review of Science Fiction, right?

265
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 Or the...

266
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 Yeah.

267
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
 I was thinking of New York Review of Science Fiction here.

268
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
 I lay review books, there's a bunch of good stuff as well.

269
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:53,920
 Oh, no, yeah, no, that's true, but there's not a... like, there's SIFWA and there's ASFA and there's like WUSFS itself, I guess, but I can't think of a nationwide American body that does science fiction commentary.

270
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,920
 National Fantasy FALFITERATION.

271
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
 I've never even heard of that.

272
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
 Yeah, there's a reason for that.

273
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:11,920
 Do you know what I mean? Like, I just wonder whether this is partly because of the structure of... I wonder whether this is because British fandom has this as kind of a national thing that we do, and maybe that's why?

274
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:26,920
 Because even if... because it might even be true that it's not better in Britain, but we're better at concentrating it into a place where people know where it is, like BSFA, because like, it might be there's loads of great stuff in America, but there's no body that's kind of working to represent that on a national level.

275
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,920
 I don't know, right in, Americans and Brits, tell me what you reckon.

276
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:40,920
 Yes, I think this is exactly the heart of the matter. I think we have the BSFA and foundation, and both of these things are national organisations that are taking science fiction and fantasy criticism very seriously.

277
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:57,920
 But I just want to say before angry people from IFR, right, in, there is the International Association of the Fantastic in the Arts, which I think is worldwide, but has quite a lot of Americans, I think, in it that runs the annual International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts, so you've got that going.

278
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,920
 And Rita Khan, of course.

279
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
 Oh, yep, no, that's true.

280
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:11,920
 So there are some things, but I think this all comes back to remember that British, the remarkable cohesion of British fandom, this is about to generate a massive split.

281
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,920
 And there's also the Finnish one.

282
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
 Oh, cool, I didn't realise that.

283
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:26,920
 I think, I think this is actually, like, so I was going into this thing and I was like, we'll have an amusing chat and I probably won't have any genuine opinions, and now I'm like, oh no, I'm not.

284
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
 Oh no, they should definitely introduce best criticism.

285
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,920
 This is very well argued and it ties in really well with British science fiction fandom, like, this is a good show, actually.

286
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:47,920
 So related to what I just said about tying into British science fiction fandom and its pursuits and tying into something I tried to get off the ground when I was very young and didn't really know how any of this worked.

287
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:55,920
 Something that Emily Arrow and I chatted about years ago, my ham could well be a decade because I think it was before "Luncon".

288
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:05,920
 Was that neither of us was particularly happy with how the best dramatic category works in that it doesn't reward short film.

289
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:12,920
 So if I was allowed to pick a Hugo category and do it as a one year thing, I would pick best short film.

290
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,920
 I would probably say films of 25 minutes or less.

291
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:37,920
 And if I was going to do this at Glasgow, I would work with chap who does Sci-Fi London and I would have a kind of Glasgow sponsored program of shorts in the year that showcased eligible shorts from around the world and encouraged the Worldcon members to watch and vote for their favorites and have that as a Hugo.

292
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:50,920
 It would tie in well with Sci-Fi London, which I think is a great British thing and also tie in obviously I know that other countries do this as well so I'm not trying to say Britain's better, but like I just say it ties in with a fan pursuit in Britain which I think would be cool.

293
00:23:50,920 --> 00:24:02,920
 And yeah, and I think short films are underrepresented in the Hugos and probably are not as influential on the genre as short stories are, which is probably why, but yeah, Liz.

294
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,920
 I would say the Sci-Fi London man, I think it's still Louis Savvy.

295
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:22,920
 Do you think there is a danger that your category would be dominated by essentially the five minute shorts that picks up out before the films and the kind of five minute MCU short films and maybe not kind of get those less commercial short films that you may be aiming to to include?

296
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:30,920
 Maybe you might have to do something like restrict them and say like, you know, there can only be one film by any given studio.

297
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
 Maybe so you only got one Pixar or one Marvel.

298
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,920
 I don't know if that would work. I don't know how you would do that.

299
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:49,920
 Because I guess for a special Hugo category, do you have to hammer out the wording in as much detail as you do if it's going into the Constitution or does the Hugo Administrator get to sort of call a spade a spade a bit more?

300
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
 I don't know how that works.

301
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,920
 What did they do for Best Video Game? Did they have a very kind of rigid definition? I assume they did probably.

302
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:06,920
 Yeah, they had a rigid definition that was very different from the one that here Alexandra is putting forward for the actual suggestion, which was slightly annoying, but there we go.

303
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
 So no, you have it. It's done the same way as anything else.

304
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,920
 You just announced the committee announces the wording that people are supposed to work to.

305
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:21,920
 I don't know if you could definitely include just one from a studio or anything like that. It's very, and they don't even have to have voting. The welcome could just reward a Hugo.

306
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
 I'm going to talk about that a bit later.

307
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,920
 I had forgotten that that's true, but that is true, isn't it?

308
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
 Yeah, 100%.

309
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
 Wow.

310
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
 Badger is the best cat Hugo.

311
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
 Yes, yes.

312
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:42,920
 A couple of months ago, John said fan art is hilariously undiscoverable, but I don't think it is as undiscoverable as short film.

313
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:51,920
 We've been talking about it in the context of the sci-fi London Film Festival, and some short films are on YouTube, but an awful lot of them aren't.

314
00:25:51,920 --> 00:26:00,920
 They're not distributed. They are dependent on film festivals around the world, and I hope that there are more online film festivals where we can see short films.

315
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:09,920
 I think we might try to surface them a bit on octa thought when they happen, but it's incredibly difficult to survey the ground.

316
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:22,920
 One of my concerns with this is that it's going to be hard for the Wussfuss members to access short films to nominate, because there's just so many of them, and they are so undiscoverable.

317
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:36,920
 But presumably, you'd end up with the same sort of thing as you get in the other categories of general release. So if something was playing the Film Festival circuit and then after it had finished the circuit, they put it on YouTube in the next year, presumably it would then count in that year.

318
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
 It depends.

319
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,920
 But everything has to have special, everything has to have special dispensations, doesn't it?

320
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:54,920
 Yeah, so it has to be voted on work by work, but also if you are going to, in my proposal, you'd be doing some sort of magic portal that Worldcom members would log into to watch the movies.

321
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:04,920
 And so I would argue that even if something had had a limited release Film Festival, if it was widely available to the Worldcom membership, I think laying people nominated for best film.

322
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:16,920
 Like, I think that is one of the big problems, and I think you'd need to address it by making sure that you worked with the filmmakers to get a lot of these movies into the sphere of the votership.

323
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:30,920
 And I think that's why I wouldn't necessarily advocate again for it to be added as a permanent Hugo, but I think doing it as a special Hugo and really putting a lot behind it to increase the profile of short films in that year, that would be really cool.

324
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
 And I think there might be scope there.

325
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:38,920
 So Esther, if you're listening to this, I think you have a volunteer for curating your Film Festival.

326
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:46,920
 No, I think if you're going to do it, you want to work with Louis Savvy because he's done so much great work for Sci-Fi London.

327
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:55,920
 And I think, firstly, I mean, it should be his right refusal because I don't know if there's anyone else in the UK that's done more for science fiction short film, but I'd rather suspect there isn't.

328
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:10,920
 So he should probably get the kudos, but also he has the contacts, the drive and the know-how, and also they've started doing the online films now, which means that maybe the technical expertise is there now, too.

329
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:20,920
 Again, started this out by not really thinking it was a coherent idea, and now I've set out loud and I'm like, "Ooh, they're interesting.

330
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,920
 Do you want to do best audio presentation, Alison?"

331
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:33,920
 One of the things that's happened this year is that last year, the Hugo Awards Study Committee was asked to go away and have a think about best audio book as a Hugo category.

332
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:42,920
 John and I are both on the Hugo Awards Study Committee, mostly because we wanted to put some oomph behind Best Game, and whenever anyone mentions Best Game, we're like, "Yes, this must be a Hugo."

333
00:28:42,920 --> 00:29:09,920
 But I have been chair of the Best Audio Book Subcommittee on that. I don't think we're going to recommend Best Audio Book, which I think is there is not a compelling argument for having it as a Hugo category, but I thought, and got some encouragement from other people, but one way to push this into the long grass would be to think about best dramatic presentation and whether there was scope for splitting out audio from video.

334
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:25,920
 If I ever take this to Wispus as a proposal, I will call my proposal Video Kill the Radio Star, and I think that there is an argument that there's a lot of good work being done in audio, and it all gets completely in audio dramatic presentation.

335
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:35,920
 So that includes things like fictional podcasts, it includes audio books, especially audio books like Sandman, where more has been done than just reading out the book.

336
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:52,920
 It includes things like the Big Finish audio dramas, and quite a lot of other audio stuff that is very good, and that we are a professional podcast that are dramatic, like, "Welcome to Night Vale," and "The Lovecraftian Ones" that the BBC do would be eligible and would be good.

337
00:29:52,920 --> 00:30:07,920
 And, like, for example, the adaptation of RUR that I had as a pick a couple of months ago, as somebody who likes a lot of audio content, I feel like it's being completely overshadowed in the Hugos in much the same way as short films are.

338
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:18,920
 There's a real discussion here, and I think it impinges on both of our categories, which is basically like, "I love short film, and I love audio dramatic presentations."

339
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:32,920
 Like, I mean, I'm a recent convert to short film, I've been watching Science Research in London for two years, so, like, you know, that is the extent of my short film knowledge, really, but I've really enjoyed being in that, and I'm really glad that they've put it online so I can.

340
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,920
 And I've listened, I've been listening to dramatic presentation on the radio since the next day of the show, it's a galaxy when I was a kid.

341
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:46,920
 But I think there is a problem here, which is, I love both of them, I think it would be cool for them to get recognition, but I'm not sure they're a big enough part of the genre for them to be part of the Hugos every year.

342
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:53,920
 So I think doing them as special categories would be a really good way of kind of squaring that circle as it were.

343
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:01,920
 Yes, and I think we have to have disclaimer for this entire segment, which is "No More Hugos, Upper Brackets, Apart From The Best Game Hugo, Obviously, Close Brackets."

344
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,920
 Yeah, and we can make room for Best Game Hugo by getting rid of best editors, so it is fine.

345
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,920
 Oh, John.

346
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
 Please write in listeners, please write in.

347
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
 Oh, John.

348
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,920
 On the subject of Hugo voting, it is now open until the 11th of August.

349
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
 So you've got a little bit more time, listeners.

350
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
 Keep reading, keep going.

351
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,920
 Don't, whatever you do, stop reading on the basis you've got loads of time, because that is the way to miss a deadloy for phowing in the hugos.

352
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
 Ask me how I know.

353
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:36,920
 In what order should we do picks?

354
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:43,920
 Should we let Alison hang on about Abba for a bit, because then we won't, she won't go on past like 10.30.

355
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

356
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,920
 Yeah, let's let Alison hang on about Abba for a bit.

357
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,920
 She's put like an essay in the show notes.

358
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
 Go on, Alison.

359
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,920
 Go on, Alison. Get wangin'.

360
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
 No, all I've done is put to the show notes.

361
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
 It's what, it's the...

362
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:07,920
 No, I mean, I'm genuinely interested to hear about Abba, because I missed the Zoom meeting immediately after you went.

363
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,920
 So I've not really heard the story yet, so I am paying attention.

364
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
 Yes, tell us about Abba.

365
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,920
 So I am going to wang on about Abba, and this is because as regular listeners to what to thought might know,

366
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
 I'm not really a science fiction fan at all.

367
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
 What I am is a futurist.

368
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:31,920
 I really like things that are about the future and of the future, and about three miles from here.

369
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:40,920
 Abba has built a purpose-built arena where they're doing a light show, where you think that you've got Abba from the 70s on stage,

370
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,920
 but obviously you don't really. It's just magic done by the industrial light of magic people.

371
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,920
 Now, they've had a thousand animators working for several years on this sort of spend of vast amount of money.

372
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:58,920
 Tickets are quite expensive, and six of us, all science fiction fans, went last week and we had a lot of fun.

373
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,920
 So if you didn't know that it was a magic trick, you just wouldn't question.

374
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
 You just assume you're watching a life-bad.

375
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,920
 It looks exactly like watching a life-bad except better in some ways because of all the money that's been spent on it.

376
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
 And it was fantastic. The sandals are very, very good.

377
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:21,920
 They've done the voices by recording Abba now, but blending the voices using machine learning with Abba at the height of their vocal skills.

378
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,920
 So that's quite good too. So it sounds amazing. It looks amazing. It's very, very good. It's quite expensive,

379
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,920
 but I mean, I think they got spent 140 million pounds on it, and you can see where that was spent.

380
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,920
 They gave us free pin badges, and I'm just afraid some of the massive cost of our tickets by immediately flogging the Mollie Bay

381
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,920
 for not inconsiderable amounts of money, not as much as the ticket's cost but plenty.

382
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,920
 And I went to something a little bit like this at Disney World in 1979, but this is quite a bit better.

383
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,920
 That was quite a long time ago, so it was great. I thought it was amazing.

384
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,920
 It's probably Pepper's Ghost, which is Victorian-like trick.

385
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,920
 Yeah, I was going to say, what thing did you go to like this in Disney World in 1979?

386
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:07,920
 A Pepper's Ghost stage show where, oh no, it was actually an animatronic stage show where they'd got heads of presidents speaking

387
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,920
 and declaiming things about the US Constitution. It was not as good.

388
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,920
 Oh, it's the Holy President's. Yeah, but there's no Pepper's Ghost in the Holy President's.

389
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
 No, no, it was just like heads, I think.

390
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,920
 It's full presidents, and now a bit worried that you've kind of conflated it with future armour heads in a jar.

391
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,920
 You did also go and see a Pepper's Ghost probably as well.

392
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:30,920
 I've seen Pepper's Ghost on many occasions, but this is just fantastic, and apparently.

393
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,920
 This is where you take a lot of the best people in the world at doing this thing and put enormous amounts of money on it,

394
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:44,920
 but also it is quite futurey because this is not creepy because actual abba, all four of them were involved in the motion capture for this

395
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,920
 and the stage management and how they walk and look.

396
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,920
 And so it's a lot less creepy than it would be or that it will be when they do this with dead pop stars,

397
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,920
 which I'm sure is going to be in the works for some people.

398
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,920
 Oh, yeah, it's coming. 100%.

399
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,920
 Because you can see a lot of bands looking at this and go, oh, this is a thing.

400
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,920
 And I think this is the thing where I go, I go to a lot of festivals, and one of the things that happens at festivals

401
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,920
 is that bands from the 70s and 80s come on stage and do all their old hit.

402
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,920
 There's normally a couple of people from the original band and a load of session musicians come on stage

403
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
 and do all their old hits.

404
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,920
 Like, what, like that? It's quite good. This is a lot better than that.

405
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,920
 If you like Abba at all, I would recommend, if you like Abba of Futurism at all, you should get on to see this.

406
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
 It's good.

407
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,920
 But I'm not right in thinking there's no actual requirement for Abba to be there when it's happening.

408
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
 It's just like there's a hologram and, you know,

409
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
 no, it's a film, right?

410
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,920
 Yeah, it's a phenomenal money maker. I mean, if they're charged, I mean, I know it must have cost them a lot of money,

411
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,920
 but, you know, there's no reason they couldn't run this for, you know, 20 years.

412
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,920
 Well, they have a live band. One of the ways they make it feel really good is that they have a live band,

413
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
 about a 12-piece live band on stage.

414
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
 Okay.

415
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,920
 But that is because you'll be all session musicians who can just be fired and you can just hire new ones when they retire and stuff.

416
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,920
 It is. Yes. They're not going to be paid a lot. If you look at this and go, oh, they've put it in London.

417
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,920
 Could they do this in every city in the world?

418
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,920
 And there's a bit where they introduce the band and they say, and I'm going to introduce the band.

419
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,920
 And they don't actually introduce the band in the way that a live band would where they say the names of the people in the band.

420
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,920
 And I was like, aha, that is because they have a film which they can roll.

421
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,920
 And they worked with Abba for six weeks and they can be playing this all around the world until the money runs out.

422
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,920
 So I think you will see Abba.

423
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,920
 But it's a purpose built arena. This is a very spendy activity.

424
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,920
 People have spent a lot of money on it. It's very exciting in a kind of weird way.

425
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,920
 So my mum and dad are huge Abba fans and they were entirely unimpressed by this because they were like,

426
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
 it's just a film. I don't understand why it's good.

427
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
 Oh, no, it's great.

428
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,920
 And so I'm interested by the disparity in the reactions.

429
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,920
 And I must admit, I think I'm more...

430
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,920
 I think it's really impressive technically. And if it was a band I liked more than I like,

431
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,920
 I'm not a huge Abba fan. But if it was a band I really liked, I don't know, the Eagles, I'd be like,

432
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,920
 "Ooh, interesting." But I do wonder whether...

433
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,920
 If a band does this that I like when it's still new and shiny, I'll be like, "Oh, I'll go and see that."

434
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,920
 And it'll be like magic. It'll be very science fiction. I'll be very into it.

435
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,920
 But in like 20 years time where there's loads of machine learning concerts,

436
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,920
 replicating old bands at their heyday, I think I might be quite a lot more jaded about it

437
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,920
 than going to see actual live music. And I did because I went to see the Eagles on their farewell one tour

438
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,920
 and it wasn't, you know, they were older and they did not sound how they did on the records

439
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,920
 and there were a lot more horns and stuff. But it was still amazing and the energy in the room was still brilliant.

440
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,920
 And to be fair, the energy in the room must be brilliant at Abba too, because you've got like, what,

441
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,920
 20,000 Abba fans, all of whom really like Abba.

442
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,920
 No, three. Three. That's the other thing is that it's a small arena. So all the seats, all the...

443
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
 Ooh.

444
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,920
 It's purpose built and it's small. So all the seats are amazing and they're standing at the front.

445
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,920
 I'm going to go back on a standing ticket so I can get right up to the front. Very excited by that.

446
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
 And I think that if you're...

447
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,920
 Well, that's interesting. I hadn't appreciated that.

448
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,920
 If your folks are Abba fans, they would probably enjoy this a whole lot.

449
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,920
 And I would commend it. But obviously people could do what they like, right? You know.

450
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,920
 So those are the two reactions though, which are... Oh yeah.

451
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,920
 Oh, God, this is amazing. This is fantastic. I'm so excited. I never got the chance to see Abba in the 70s.

452
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,920
 I'm really excited to go and this will be great and I don't care that it's a light trick.

453
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,920
 And why would you want to do that? It's just a film.

454
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,920
 No, I mean, that's exactly it. I did see. I just remembered because I was like, you were like, I never got to see them.

455
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
 I never got to see Injuri in the blockheads.

456
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
 Oh, I've seen them.

457
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,920
 But I did get to see Phil Jupiters and the blockheads and that was really good.

458
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,920
 A festival like Little Day Long festival thing in Stanford. And that was nice.

459
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:15,920
 I also understand that this is the technology that was used to do that performance of the Queen on the balcony on the final day of the Jubilee weekend when a holographic version of the Queen came out and waved to the crowd.

460
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,920
 The difficult thing with that is that obviously it's much more difficult to do this sort of hologram for a lizard.

461
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,920
 My pick is Moon Knight. This is not particularly current because Moon Knight wrapped up a few weeks ago now, but I did quite like it.

462
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:38,920
 So Moon Knight is a character I got into through broadcasting because there's a podcast called The Incompable and they did a summer long tournament of superheroes.

463
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,920
 And Moon Knight made it to the last 16 in that tournament, beating such little known characters as Thor.

464
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,920
 And so I kind of read the comics because I was like, oh, this is interesting.

465
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
 They're all talking about Moon Knight a lot. He sounds kind of weird.

466
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:58,920
 And I got into the comics which kind of starts to explore his character much more in the sense of like dissociative identity disorder and stuff like that.

467
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,920
 And also the mysticism of the character was much more focused.

468
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:13,920
 Whereas originally Moon Knight was a bad Batman rip-off and originally the different personalities were basically just alter egos he had while being a bad Batman rip-off.

469
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:23,920
 And so I was really pleased that Moon Knight, the series, lent very much more into DID mysticism than it did into bad Batman rip-offs, which I thought was very good.

470
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:34,920
 In general, I very much like Oscar Isaac. I was a little bit uncomvinced by the accent, but then that gets like specifically addressed in the universe of the show, which I thought was brilliant.

471
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,920
 And it, I think, kept me engaged as someone who likes the character. It kind of gave me enough to be like, oh, I think I might know what's happening there.

472
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,920
 And then I was like, oh, that was right. And that was very exciting. But also a lot of the supporting characters were really good and I liked Ethan Hawke a lot.

473
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:55,920
 I understood a lot better why they cast him as the villain after about episode 3 or episode 4. And yeah, just really, really enjoyed it generally.

474
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,920
 I think it's much more character driven than plot driven. I have a few friends who found a couple of the episodes a bit lacking in plot.

475
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,920
 And I was like, that was so full of stuff, but it was a lot kind of, it wasn't much plot stuff. It was more kind of internal stuff.

476
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:16,920
 But I kind of think that makes sense for the character anyway, because the character is very much about, well, because he has multiple personalities, they do tend to focus on that a lot in some of the comics.

477
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:25,920
 So that kind of made sense to me. Anyway, but yeah, I really enjoyed it generally. I think it is probably my favourite of the Marvel shows so far beating previous favourite Hawke I.

478
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
 Alison, you haven't seen Moon Knight yet.

479
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:36,920
 I haven't seen any of it. I know nothing of it. I have zoned out through your description in case I am, in case it was a bit spoilery for me.

480
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:50,920
 I mean, I am excited to watch it. If you could send me a note saying which bits of the Marvel Cinematic and Television Universe I need to have watched before I start watching Moon Knight, I will put them on my iceberg.

481
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
 None.

482
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,920
 Yeah, it's probably probably okay. I could start from the beginning of Moon Knight. In that case, I'll do it after Severance. I'm not finished with Severance yet.

483
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:07,920
 To the point where one of our friends was like, I don't really understand the point of this because how does it tie into the rest of the MCU, which I think is like the opposite reaction to Alison of things so interesting.

484
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,920
 Well, only because I'm in MCU bankruptcy.

485
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
 Liz, what did you think of Moon Knight?

486
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,920
 I think I since you give up and just start watching the MCU in Random Order. Just go for it. Just pick what looks fun.

487
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
 Yes, to it.

488
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:27,920
 I kind of have had that experience because that's how I did comics as a child because we only got comics kind of randomly when we were lucky and we just really didn't.

489
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,920
 And we just read bits of the Marvel Universe totally out of order and not understand anything. I still quite like them a lot.

490
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,920
 Yeah, to walk both ways or pill in the snow to get your Marvel comic.

491
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
 Yes.

492
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:47,920
 I've seen Moon Knight. It's pretty good. The plot is... I mean, the plot's not very good, is it? So it's a good job. It's not particularly plot oriented because the plot is basically a bit...

493
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,920
 The plot is a bit of nonsense with some fighting and so on. But Oscar Isaac is very, very good.

494
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,920
 He somehow manages to pull off having these two identities, one of which is a mercenary and one of which is a museum nerd.

495
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,920
 And somehow Oscar Isaac manages to pull off looking like a nerd.

496
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
 Yeah.

497
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,920
 You know, kind of looking completely unremarkable in a way that I didn't...

498
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,920
 You wouldn't think he would if you sort of saw him in the other persona.

499
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,920
 And yeah, so I thought he was very good as a central character.

500
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,920
 And I think the supporting actors in it are also pretty good.

501
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:29,920
 It's just, you know, the plot was kind of a "Let's Find Out About this superhero" and "Oh, there's a threat to the world and there's a villain's person and we have to resolve it."

502
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,920
 And here's a little hook for maybe the next season.

503
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,920
 And I was not particularly engaged in any of that, really. But I did like Oscar Isaac.

504
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:46,920
 I do very much like... I do like F.M.A.R.E.R. and portrayal of this god who is not really a benevolent force on Oscar Isaac character.

505
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,920
 But it was not... I don't think it's right up there in my favourite MCU ones just because it felt like the plot was a bit like an MCU.

506
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,920
 Oh, there is a superhero and a villain and a threat in the world.

507
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,920
 And I couldn't tell you anything that made it stand out particularly from the other 27 iterations of this plot.

508
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,920
 But I quite enjoyed it anyway. Especially the hippo.

509
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,920
 Yes, yes.

510
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:15,920
 Sorry to anyone who was champing at the bit to find out what Liz's pick was, but I have to go to brunch now because it's Father's Day.

511
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,920
 And so I am cruelly cutting Liz off in order to not annoy my family.

512
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,920
 But that was the Octa thought podcast and it's goodbye from me.

513
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,920
 It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.

514
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,920
 Does that mean I wanged on about Abba for too long?

515
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,920
 No, you aren't going to about Abba for as long as I expected.

516
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:56,920
 [Music]

517
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,920
 I just finished the last graduate by Naomi Novick, which I was good.

518
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,920
 And then I was a cliffhanger and I was just...

519
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,920
 I got to the end of the book and I was like on the train and I was like, "Oh no, I want to know."

520
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
 Anyway, I have to wait for the next one.

521
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,920
 I think the third one is out this year though, so you should be okay.

522
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,920
 Yeah, people have said the second one ends on a massive cliffhanger.

523
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,920
 It's an entirely predictable cliffhanger, really.

524
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
 That's all I said in my pick.

525
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,920
 Entirely predictable cliffhanger in hindsight.

526
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,920
 So the first one also ends on a giant cliffhanger, so it fits with the series, I think.

527
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,920
 Yeah, but in the case of the first cliffhanger, I knew what it would be from like page three of the book,

528
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,920
 so I wasn't very surprised.

529
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,920
 I'm pretty sure I know what the second one is going to be as well, not the time for the second book.

530
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,920
 This is one of the things where I'm kind of like, I have to grade these things on a curve

531
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,920
 because when books are as predictable as this, you go, "Oh yes, but it's young adults."

532
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
 You probably wouldn't have spotted it when you were 16.

533
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,920
 I mean, I didn't spoil it by never try.

534
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,920
 Whenever I spotted a twist in a plot coming, I'm like, "That was extremely obvious because I noticed it,

535
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,920
 which is why I really hate that Miles episode of Doctor Who, because I saw the twist coming at the beginning,

536
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,920
 and I was like, "That is bad writing if I notice."

537
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,920
 Yeah, so the problem is that the more science fiction you read, or the more books you read generally,

538
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,920
 the more inclined you are to spot where writers are doing things are then you.

539
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,920
 And you're correct that if you're insisting on having fun when you read,

540
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,920
 it's more fun to read without spotting what's going to happen.

541
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
 Thanks, I think.

542
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,920
 And I remember this from reading the first book of a song of ice and fire,

543
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,920
 and I did not spot the big reveal, despite the fact that my friends were like, "This is a thing."

544
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,920
 And I was like, "Oh, that's so obvious. I did not spot it."

545
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,920
 And of course, it's the big reveal for the entire series, not just the first book,

546
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,920
 but it's very obvious from the first book, if you're paying attention.

547
00:46:48,920 --> 00:47:16,360
 The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin MacLeod in Com
